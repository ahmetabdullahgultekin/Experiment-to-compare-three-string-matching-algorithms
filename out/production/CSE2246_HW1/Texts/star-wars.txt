               A LONG TIME AGO, IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR, AWAY...

               A VAST SEA OF STARS SERVES AS THE BACKDROP FOR THE MAIN TITLE.
               WAR DRUMS ECHO THROUGH THE HEAVENS AS A ROLLUP SLOWLY CRAWLS
               INTO INFINITY.

                    IT IS A PERIOD OF CIVIL WAR. REBEL SPACESHIPS,
                    STRIKING FROM A HIDDEN BASE, HAVE WON THEIR FIRST
                    VICTORY AGAINST THE EVIL GALACTIC EMPIRE.

                    DURING THE BATTLE, REBEL SPIES MANAGED TO STEAL
                    SECRET PLANS TO THE EMPIRE'S ULTIMATE WEAPON, THE
                    DEATH STAR, AN ARMORED SPACE STATION WITH ENOUGH
                    POWER TO DESTROY AN ENTIRE PLANET.

                    PURSUED BY THE EMPIRE'S SINISTER AGENTS, PRINCESS
                    LEIA RACES HOME ABOARD HER STARSHIP, CUSTODIAN OF
                    THE STOLEN PLANS THAT CAN SAVE HER PEOPLE AND
                    RESTORE FREEDOM TO THE GALAXY...

               THE AWESOME YELLOW PLANET OF TATOOINE EMERGES FROM A TOTAL
               ECLIPSE, HER TWO MOONS GLOWING AGAINST THE DARKNESS. A TINY
               SILVER SPACECRAFT, A REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER FIRING LASERS
               FROM THE BACK OF THE SHIP, RACES THROUGH SPACE. IT IS PURSED
               BY A GIANT IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER. HUNDREDS OF DEADLY
               LASERBOLTS STREAK FROM THE IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER, CAUSING
               THE MAIN SOLAR FIN OF THE REBEL CRAFT TO DISINTEGRATE.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY

               AN EXPLOSION ROCKS THE SHIP AS TWO ROBOTS, ARTOO-DETOO (R2-
               D2) AND SEE-THREEPIO (C-3PO) STRUGGLE TO MAKE THEIR WAY
               THROUGH THE SHAKING, BOUNCING PASSAGEWAY. BOTH ROBOTS ARE
               OLD AND BATTERED. ARTOO IS A SHORT, CLAW-ARMED TRIPOD. HIS
               FACE IS A MASS OF COMPUTER LIGHTS SURROUNDING A RADAR EYE.
               THREEPIO, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A TALL, SLENDER ROBOT OF
               HUMAN PROPORTIONS. HE HAS A GLEAMING BRONZE-LIKE METALLIC
               SURFACE OF AN ART DECO DESIGN.

               ANOTHER BLAST SHAKES THEM AS THEY STRUGGLE ALONG THEIR WAY.

                                     THREEPIO
                         DID YOU HEAR THAT? THEY'VE SHUT DOWN
                         THE MAIN REACTOR. WE'LL BE DESTROYED
                         FOR SURE. THIS IS MADNESS!

               REBEL TROOPERS RUSH PAST THE ROBOTS AND TAKE UP POSITIONS IN
               THE MAIN PASSAGEWAY. THEY AIM THEIR WEAPONS TOWARD THE DOOR.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WE'RE DOOMED!

               THE LITTLE R2 UNIT MAKES A SERIES OF ELECTRONIC SOUNDS THAT
               ONLY ANOTHER ROBOT COULD UNDERSTAND.

                                     THREEPIO
                         THERE'LL BE NO ESCAPE FOR THE PRINCESS
                         THIS TIME.

               ARTOO CONTINUES MAKING BEEPING SOUNDS. TENSION MOUNTS AS
               LOUD METALLIC LATCHES CLANK AND THE SCREAM OF HEAVY EQUIPMENT
               ARE HEARD MOVING AROUND THE OUTSIDE HULL OF THE SHIP.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WHAT'S THAT?

               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE

               THE IMPERIAL CRAFT HAS EASILY OVERTAKEN THE REBEL BLOCKADE
               RUNNER. THE SMALLER REBEL SHIP IS BEING DRAWN INTO THE
               UNDERSIDE DOCK OF THE GIANT IMPERIAL STARSHIP.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               THE NERVOUS REBEL TROOPERS AIM THEIR WEAPONS. SUDDENLY A
               TREMENDOUS BLAST OPENS UP A HOLE IN THE MAIN PASSAGEWAY AND
               A SCORE OF FEARSOME ARMORED SPACESUITED STORMTROOPERS MAKE
               THEIR WAY INTO THE SMOKE-FILLED CORRIDOR.

               IN A FEW MINUTES THE ENTIRE PASSAGEWAY IS ABLAZE WITH
               LASERFIRE. THE DEADLY BOLTS RICOCHET IN WILD RANDOM PATTERNS
               CREATING HUGE EXPLOSIONS. STORMTROOPERS SCATTER AND DUCK
               BEHIND STORAGE LOCKERS. LASERBOLTS HIT SEVERAL REBEL SOLDIERS
               WHO SCREAM AND STAGGER THROUGH THE SMOKE, HOLDING SHATTERED
               ARMS AND FACES.

               AN EXPLOSION HITS NEAR THE ROBOTS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO
                         TRUST THE LOGIC OF A HALF-SIZED
                         THERMOCAPSULARY DEHOUSING ASSISTER...

               ARTOO COUNTERS WITH AN ANGRY REBUTTAL AS THE BATTLE RAGES
               AROUND THE TWO HAPLESS ROBOTS.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY

               A DEATH-WHITE WASTELAND STRETCHES FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON.
               THE TREMENDOUS HEAT OF TWO HUGE TWIN SUNS SETTLE ON A LONE
               FIGURE, LUKE SKYWALKER, A FARM BOY WITH HEROIC ASPIRATIONS
               WHO LOOKS MUCH YOUNGER THAN HIS EIGHTEEN YEARS. HIS SHAGGY
               HAIR AND BAGGY TUNIC GIVE HIM THE AIR OF A SIMPLE BUT LOVABLE
               LAD WITH A PRIZE-WINNING SMILE.

               A LIGHT WIND WHIPS AT HIM AS HE ADJUSTS SEVERAL VALVES ON A
               LARGE BATTERED MOISTURE VAPORATOR WHICH STICKS OUT OF THE
               DESERT FLOOR MUCH LIKE AN OIL PIPE WITH VALVES. HE IS AIDED
               BY A BEATUP TREAD-ROBOT WITH SIX CLAW ARMS. THE LITTLE ROBOT
               APPEARS TO BE BARELY FUNCTIONING AND MOVES WITH JERKY MOTIONS.
               A BRIGHT SPARKLE IN THE MORNING SKY CATCHES LUKE'S EYE AND
               HE INSTINCTIVELY GRABS A PAIR OF ELECTROBINOCULARS FROM HIS
               UTILITY BELT. HE STANDS TRANSFIXED FOR A FEW MOMENTS STUDYING
               THE HEAVENS, THEN DASHED TOWARD HIS DENTED, CRUDELY REPAIRED
               LANDSPEEDER (AN AUTO-LIKE TRANSPORT THAT TRAVELS A FEW FEET
               ABOVE THE GROUND ON A MAGNETIC-FIELD). HE MOTIONS FOR THE
               TINY ROBOT TO FOLLOW HIM.

                                     LUKE
                         HURRY UP! COME WITH ME! WHAT ARE YOU
                         WAITING FOR?! GET IN GEAR!

               THE ROBOT SCOOTS AROUND IN A TIGHT CIRCLE, STOPS SHORT, AND
               SMOKE BEGINS TO POUR OUT OF EVERY JOINT. LUKE THROWS HIS
               ARMS UP IN DISGUST. EXASPERATED, THE YOUNG FARM BOY JUMPS
               INTO HIS LANDSPEEDER LEAVING THE SMOLDERING ROBOT TO HUM
               MADLY.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY

               THE AWESOME, SEVEN-FOOT-TALL DARK LORD OF THE SITH MAKES HIS
               WAY INTO THE BLINDING LIGHT OF THE MAIN PASSAGEWAY. THIS IS
               DARTH VADER, RIGHT HAND OF THE EMPEROR. HIS FACE IS OBSCURED
               BY HIS FLOWING BLACK ROBES AND GROTESQUE BREATH MASK, WHICH
               STANDS OUT NEXT TO THE FASCIST WHITE ARMORED SUITS OF THE
               IMPERIAL STORMTROOPERS. EVERYONE INSTINCTIVELY BACKS AWAY
               FROM THE IMPOSING WARRIOR AND A DEATHLY QUIET SWEEPS THROUGH
               THE REBEL TROOPS. SEVERAL OF THE REBEL TROOPS BREAK AND RUN
               IN A FRENZIED PANIC.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               A WOMAN'S HAND PUTS A CARD INTO AN OPENING IN ARTOO'S DOME.
               ARTOO MAKES BEEPING SOUNDS.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               THREEPIO STANDS IN A HALLWAY, SOMEWHAT BEWILDERED. ARTOO IS
               NOWHERE IN SIGHT. THE PITIFUL SCREAMS OF THE DOOMED REBEL
               SOLDIERS CAN BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         ARTOO! ARTOO-DETOO, WHERE ARE YOU?

               A FAMILIAR CLANKING SOUND ATTACKS THREEPIO'S ATTENTION AND
               HE SPOTS LITTLE ARTOO AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY IN A SMOKE-
               FILLED ALCOVE. A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL (ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS
               OLD) STANDS IN FRONT OF ARTOO. SURREAL AND OUT OF PLACE,
               DREAMLIKE AND HALF HIDDEN IN THE SMOKE, SHE FINISHES ADJUSTING
               SOMETHING ON ARTOO'S COMPUTER FACE, THEN WATCHES AS THE LITTLE
               ROBOT JOINS HIS COMPANION.

                                     THREEPIO
                         AT LAST! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

               STORMTROOPERS CAN BE HEARD BATTLING IN THE DISTANCE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         THEY'RE HEADING IN THIS DIRECTION.
                         WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE'LL BE
                         SENT TO THE SPICE MINE OF KESSEL OR
                         SMASHED INTO WHO KNOWS WHAT!

               ARTOO SCOOTS PAST HIS BRONZE FRIEND AND RACES DOWN THE
               SUBHALLWAY. THREEPIO CHASES AFTER HIM.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WAIT A MINUTE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

               ARTOO RESPONDS WITH ELECTRONIC BEEPS.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR

               THE EVIL DARTH VADER STANDS AMID THE BROKEN AND TWISTED BODIES
               OF HIS FOES. HE GRABS A WOUNDED REBEL OFFICER BY THE NECK AS
               AN IMPERIAL OFFICER RUSHES UP TO THE DARK LORD.

                                     IMPERIAL OFFICER
                         THE DEATH STAR PLANS ARE NOT IN THE
                         MAIN COMPUTER.

               VADER SQUEEZES THE NECK OF THE REBEL OFFICER, WHO STRUGGLES
               IN VAIN.

                                     VADER
                         WHERE ARE THOSE TRANSMISSIONS YOU
                         INTERCEPTED?

               VADER LIFTS THE REBEL OFF HIS FEET BY HIS THROAT.

                                     VADER
                         WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THOSE PLANS?

                                     REBEL OFFICER
                         WE INTERCEPTED NO TRANSMISSIONS.
                         AAAH... THIS IS A CONSULAR SHIP.
                         WERE ON A DIPLOMATIC MISSION.

                                     VADER
                         IF THIS IS A CONSULAR SHIP... WERE
                         IS THE AMBASSADOR?

               THE REBEL REFUSES TO SPEAK BUT EVENTUALLY CRIES OUT AS THE
               DARK LORD BEGINS TO SQUEEZE THE OFFICER'S THROAT, CREATING A
               GRUESOME SNAPPING AND CHOKING, UNTIL THE SOLDIER GOES LIMP.
               VADER TOSSES THE DEAD SOLDIER AGAINST THE WALL AND TURNS TO
               HIS TROOPS.

                                     VADER
                         COMMANDER, TEAR THIS SHIP APART UNTIL
                         YOU'VE FOUND THOSE PLANS AND BRING
                         ME THE AMBASSADOR. I WANT HER ALIVE!

               THE STORMTROOPERS SCURRY INTO THE SUBHALLWAYS.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

               THE LOVELY YOUNG GIRL HUDDLES IN A SMALL ALCOVE AS THE
               STORMTROOPERS SEARCH THROUGH THE SHIP. SHE IS PRINCESS LEIA
               ORGANA, A MEMBER OF THE ALDERAAN SENATE. THE FEAR IN HER
               EYES SLOWLY GIVES WAY TO ANGER AS THE MUTED CRUSHING SOUNDS
               OF THE APPROACHING STORMTROOPERS GROW LOUDER. ONE OF THE
               TROOPERS SPOTS HER.

                                     TROOPER
                         THERE SHE IS! SET FOR STUN!

               LEIA STEPS FROM HER HIDING PLACE AND BLASTS A TROOPER WITH
               HER LASER PISTOL. SHE STARTS TO RUN BUT IS FELLED BY A
               PARALYZING RAY. THE TROOPERS INSPECT HER INERT BODY.

                                     TROOPER
                         SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. INFORM LORD
                         VADER WE HAVE A PRISONER.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

               ARTOO STOPS BEFORE THE SMALL HATCH OF AN EMERGENCY LIFEPOD.
               HE SNAPS THE SEAL ON THE MAIN LATCH AND A RED WARNING LIGHT
               BEGINS TO FLASH. THE STUBBY ASTRO-ROBOT WORKS HIS WAY INTO
               THE CRAMPED FOUR-MAN POD.

                                     THREEPIO
                         HEY, YOU'RE NOT PERMITTED IN THERE.
                         IT'S RESTRICTED. YOU'LL BE DEACTIVATED
                         FOR SURE..

               ARTOO BEEPS SOMETHING TO HIM.

                                     THREEPIO
                         DON'T CALL ME A MINDLESS PHILOSOPHER,
                         YOU OVERWEIGHT GLOB OF GREASE! NOW
                         COME OUT BEFORE SOMEBODY SEES YOU.

               ARTOO WHISTLES SOMETHING AT HIS RELUCTANT FRIEND REGARDING
               THE MISSION HE IS ABOUT TO PERFORM.

                                     THREEPIO
                         SECRET MISSION? WHAT PLANS? WHAT ARE
                         YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M NOT GETTING
                         IN THERE!

               ARTOO ISN'T HAPPY WITH THREEPIO'S STUBBORNNESS, AND HE BEEPS
               AND TWANGS ANGRILY.

               A NEW EXPLOSION, THIS TIME VERY CLOSE, SENDS DUST AND DEBRIS
               THROUGH THE NARROW SUBHALLWAY. FLAMES LICK AT THREEPIO AND,
               AFTER A FLURRY OF ELECTRONIC SWEARING FROM ARTOO, THE LANKY
               ROBOT JUMPS INTO THE LIFEPOD.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'M GOING TO REGRET THIS.

               INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER

               ON THE MAIN VIEWSCREEN, THE LIFEPOD CARRYING THE TWO TERRIFIED
               ROBOTS SPEEDS AWAY FROM THE STRICKEN REBEL SPACECRAFT.

                         FORMS. IT MUST HAVE BEEN SHORT-
                         CIRCUITED.

               INT. LIFEPOD

               ARTOO AND THREEPIO LOOK OUT AT THE RECEDING IMPERIAL STARSHIP.
               STARS CIRCLE AS THE POD ROTATES THROUGH THE GALAXY.

                                     THREEPIO
                         THAT'S FUNNY, THE DAMAGE DOESN'T
                         LOOK AS BAD FROM OUT HERE.

               ARTOO BEEPS AN ASSURING RESPONSE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         ARE YOU SURE THIS THINGS SAFE?

               HEAT WAVES RADIATE FROM THE DOZEN OR SO BLEACHED WHITE
               BUILDINGS. LUKE PILOTS HIS LANDSPEEDER THROUGH THE DUSTY
               EMPTY STREET OF THE TINY SETTLEMENT. AN OLD WOMAN RUNS TO
               GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE SPEEDING VEHICLE, SHAKING HER FIST
               AT LUKE AS HE FLIES PAST.

                                     WOMAN
                         I'VE TOLD YOU KIDS TO SLOW DOWN!

               INT. POWER STATION - DAY

               LUKE BURSTS INTO THE POWER STATION, WAKING THE FIXER, A RUGGED
               MECHANIC AND CAMIE, A SEXY, DISHEVELED GIRL WHO HAS BEEN
               ASLEEP IN HIS LAP. THEY GRUMBLED AS HE RACES THROUGH THE
               OFFICE, YELLING WILDLY.

                                     FIXER
                         DID I HEAR A YOUNG NOISE BLAST THROUGH
                         HERE?

                                     CAMIE
                         IT WAS JUST WORMIE ON ANOTHER RAMPAGE.

               LUKE BOUNCES INTO A SMALL ROOM BEHIND THE OFFICE WHERE DEAK
               AND WINDY, TWO TOUGH BOYS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS LUKE, ARE
               PLAYING A COMPUTER POOL-LIKE GAME WITH BIGGS, A BURLY,
               HANDSOME BOY A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN THE REST. HIS FLASHY
               CITY ATTIRE IS A SHARP CONTRAST TO THE LOOSE-FITTING TUNICS
               OF THE FARM BOYS. A ROBOT REPAIRS SOME EQUIPMENT IN THE
               BACKGROUND.

                                     LUKE
                         SHAPE IT UP YOU GUYS!... BIGGS?

               LUKE'S SURPRISE AT THE APPEARANCE OF BIGGS GIVES WAY TO GREAT
               JOY AND EMOTION. THEY GIVE EACH OTHER A GREAT BEAR HUG.

                                     LUKE
                         I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE BACK! WHEN
                         DID YOU GET IN?

                                     BIGGS
                         JUST NOW. I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU,
                         HOT SHOT. I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HERE...
                         CERTAINLY DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BE
                         OUT WORKING.
                              (HE LAUGHS)

                                     LUKE
                         THE ACADEMY DIDN'T CHANGE YOU
                         MUCH...BUT YOU'RE BACK SO SOON? HEY,
                         WHAT HAPPENED, DIDN'T YOU GET YOUR
                         COMMISSION?

               BIGGS HAS AN AIR OF COOL THAT SEEMS SLIGHTLY PHONY.

                                     BIGGS
                         OF COURSE I GOT IT. SIGNED ABOARD
                         THE RAND ECLIPTIC LAST WEEK. FIRST
                         MATE BIGGS DARKLIGHTER AT YOUR
                         SERVICE...
                              (HE SALUTES)
                         ...I JUST CAME TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO
                         ALL YOU UNFORTUNATE LANDLOCKED
                         SIMPLETONS.

               EVERYONE LAUGHS. THE DAZZLING SPECTACLE OF HIS DASHING FRIEND
               IS ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR LUKE, BUT SUDDENLY HE SNAPS OUT OF
               IT.

                                     LUKE
                         I ALMOST FORGOT. THERE'S A BATTLE
                         GOING ON! RIGHT HERE IN OUR SYSTEM.
                         COME AND LOOK!

                                     DEAK
                         NOT AGAIN! FORGET IT.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION -
               DAY

               THE GROUP STUMBLES OUT INTO THE STIFLING DESERT SUN. CAMIE
               AND THE FIXER COMPLAIN AND ARE FORCED TO SHADE THEIR EYES.
               LUKE HAS HIS BINOCULARS OUT SCANNING THE HEAVENS.

                                     LUKE
                         THERE THEY ARE!

               BIGGS TAKES THE BINOCULARS FROM LUKE AS THE OTHERS STRAIN TO
               SEE SOMETHING WITH THE NAKED EYE. THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
               BIGGS SEES TWO SMALL SILVER SPECKS.

                                     BIGGS
                         THAT'S NO BATTLE, HOT SHOT... THEY'RE
                         JUST SITTING THERE! PROBABLY A
                         FREIGHTER-TANKER REFUELING.

                                     LUKE
                         BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF FIRING
                         EARLIER...

               CAMIE GRABS THE BINOCULARS AWAY BANGING THEM AGAINST THE
               BUILDING IN THE PROCESS. LUKE GRABS THEM.

                                     LUKE
                         HEY, EASY WITH THOSE...

                                     CAMIE
                         DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, WORMIE.

               THE FIXER GIVES LUKE A HARD LOOK AND THE YOUNG FARM BOY SHRUGS
               HIS SHOULDERS IN RESIGNATION.

                                     FIXER
                         I KEEP TELLING YOU, THE REBELLION IS
                         A LONG WAY FROM HERE. I DOUBT IF THE
                         EMPIRE WOULD EVEN FIGHT TO KEEP THIS
                         SYSTEM. BELIEVE ME LUKE, THIS PLANET
                         IS A BIG HUNK OF NOTHING...

               LUKE AGREES, ALTHOUGH IT'S OBVIOUS HE ISN'T SURE WHY. THE
               GROUP STUMBLES BACK INTO THE POWER STATION, GRUMBLING ABOUT
               LUKE'S INEPTITUDE.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY

               PRINCESS LEIA IS LED DOWN A LOW-CEILINGED HALLWAY BY A SQUAD
               OF ARMORED STORMTROOPERS. HER HANDS ARE BOUND AND SHE IS
               BRUTALLY SHOVED WHEN SHE IS UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE BRISKLY
               MARCHING TROOPS. THEY STOP IN A SMOKY HALLWAY AS DARTH VADER
               EMERGES FROM THE SHADOWS. THE SINISTER DARK LORD STARES HARD
               AT THE FRAIL YOUNG SENATOR, BUT SHE DOESN'T MOVE.

                                     LEIA
                         LORD VADER, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
                         ONLY YOU COULD BE SO BOLD. THE
                         IMPERIAL SENATE WILL NOT SIT FOR
                         THIS, WHEN THEY HEAR YOU'VE ATTACKED
                         A DIPLOMATIC...

                                     VADER
                         DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME, YOUR
                         HIGHNESS. YOU WEREN'T ON ANY MERCY
                         MISSION THIS TIME. YOU PASSED DIRECTLY
                         THROUGH A RESTRICTED SYSTEM. SEVERAL
                         TRANSMISSIONS WERE BEAMED TO THIS
                         SHIP BY REBEL SPIES. I WANT TO KNOW
                         WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PLANS THEY SENT
                         YOU.

                                     LEIA
                         I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
                         ABOUT. I'M A MEMBER OF THE IMPERIAL
                         SENATE ON A DIPLOMATIC MISSION TO
                         ALDERAAN...

                                     VADER
                         YOU'RE A PART OF THE REBEL ALLIANCE...
                         AND A TRAITOR. TAKE HER AWAY!

               LEIA IS MARCHED AWAY DOWN THE HALLWAY AND INTO THE SMOLDERING
               HOLE BLASTED IN THE SIDE OF THE SHIP. AN IMPERIAL COMMANDER
               TURNS TO VADER.

                                     COMMANDER
                         HOLDING HER IS DANGEROUS. IF WORD OF
                         THIS GETS OUT, IT COULD GENERATE
                         SYMPATHY FOR THE REBELLION IN THE
                         SENATE.

                                     VADER
                         I HAVE TRACED THE REBEL SPIES TO
                         HER. NOW SHE IS MY ONLY LINK TO FIND
                         THEIR SECRET BASE!

                                     COMMANDER
                         SHE'LL DIE BEFORE SHE TELLS YOU
                         ANYTHING.

                                     VADER
                         LEAVE THAT TO ME. SEND A DISTRESS
                         SIGNAL AND THEN INFORM THE SENATE
                         THAT ALL ABOARD WERE KILLED!

               ANOTHER IMPERIAL OFFICER APPROACHES VADER AND THE COMMANDER.
               THEY STOP AND SNAP TO ATTENTION.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         LORD VADER, THE BATTLE STATION PLANS
                         ARE NOT ABOARD THIS SHIP! AND NO
                         TRANSMISSIONS WERE MADE. AN ESCAPE
                         POD WAS JETTISONED DURING THE
                         FIGHTING, BUT NO LIFE FORMS WERE
                         ABOARD.

               VADER TURNS TO THE COMMANDER.

                                     VADER
                         SHE MUST HAVE HIDDEN THE PLANS IN
                         THE ESCAPE POD. SEND A DETACHMENT
                         DOWN TO RETRIEVE THEM. SEE TO IT
                         PERSONALLY, COMMANDER. THERE'LL BE
                         NO ONE TO STOP US THIS TIME.

                                     COMMANDER
                         YES, SIR.

               EXT. SPACE

               THE IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER COMES OVER THE SURFACE OF THE
               PLANET TATOOINE.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT

               JUNDLAND, OR "NO MAN'S LAND", WHERE THE RUGGED DESERT MESAS
               MEET THE FOREBODING DUNE SEA. THE TWO HELPLESS ASTRO-DROIDS
               KICK UP CLOUDS OF SAND AS THEY LEAVE THE LIFEPOD AND CLUMSILY
               WORK THEIR WAY ACROSS THE DESERT WASTELAND. THE LIFEPOD IN
               THE DISTANCE RESTS HALF BURIED IN THE SAND.

                                     THREEPIO
                         HOW DID I GET INTO THIS MESS? I REALLY
                         DON'T KNOW HOW. WE SEEM TO BE MADE
                         TO SUFFER. IT'S OUR LOT IN LIFE.

               ARTOO ANSWERS WITH BEEPING SOUNDS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'VE GOT TO REST BEFORE I FALL APART.
                         MY JOINTS ARE ALMOST FROZEN.

               ARTOO CONTINUES TO RESPOND WITH BEEPING SOUNDS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WHAT A DESOLATE PLACE THIS IS.

               SUDDENLY ARTOO WHISTLES, MAKES A SHARP RIGHT TURN AND STARTS
               OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ROCKY DESERT MESAS. THREEPIO
               STOPS AND YELLS AT HIM.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

               A STREAM OF ELECTRONIC NOISES POURS FORTH FROM THE SMALL
               ROBOT.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WELL, I'M NOT GOING THAT WAY. IT'S
                         MUCH TOO ROCKY. THIS WAY IS MUCH
                         EASIER.

               ARTOO COUNTERS WITH A LONG WHISTLE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THERE ARE
                         SETTLEMENTS OVER THERE?

               ARTOO CONTINUES TO MAKE BEEPING SOUNDS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         DON'T GET TECHNICAL WITH ME.

               ARTOO CONTINUES TO MAKE BEEPING SOUNDS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WHAT MISSION? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
                         ABOUT? I'VE HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH OF
                         YOU! GO THAT WAY! YOU'LL BE
                         MALFUNCTIONING WITHIN A DAY, YOU
                         NEARSIGHTED SCRAP PILE!

               THREEPIO GIVES THE LITTLE ROBOT A KICK AND STARTS OFF IN THE
               DIRECTION OF THE VAST DUNE SEA.

                                     THREEPIO
                         AND DON'T LET ME CATCH YOU FOLLOWING
                         ME BEGGING FOR HELP, BECAUSE YOU
                         WON'T GET IT.

               ARTOO'S REPLY IS A RATHER RUDE SOUND. HE TURNS AND TRUDGES
               OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TOWERING MESAS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         NO MORE ADVENTURES. I'M NOT GOING
                         THAT WAY.

               ARTOO BEEPS TO HIMSELF AS HE MAKES HIS WAY TOWARD THE DISTANT
               MOUNTAINS.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA

               THREEPIO, HOT AND TIRED, STRUGGLES UP OVER THE RIDGE OF A
               DUNE; ONLY TO FIND MORE DUNES, WHICH SEEM TO GO ON FOR ENDLESS
               MILES.  HE LOOKS BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE NOW DISTANT
               ROCK MESAS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         THAT MALFUNCTIONING LITTLE TWERP.
                         THIS IS ALL HIS FAULT! HE TRICKED ME
                         INTO GOING THIS WAY, BUT HE'LL DO NO
                         BETTER.

               IN A HUFF OF ANGER AND FRUSTRATION, THREEPIO KNOCKS THE SAND
               FROM HIS JOINTS. HIS PLIGHT SEEMS HOPELESS, WHEN A GLINT OF
               REFLECTED LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE REVEALS AN OBJECT MOVING
               TOWARDS HIM.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WAIT, WHAT'S THAT? A TRANSPORT! I'M
                         SAVED!

               THE BRONZE ANDROID WAVES FRANTICALLY AND YELLS AT THE
               APPROACHING TRANSPORT.

                                     THREEPIO
                         OVER HERE! HELP! PLEASE, HELP!

                         THE AFTERBURNERS AND CAME IN LOW ON
                         DEAK'S TRAIL. I WAS SO CLOSE I THOUGHT
                         I WAS GOING TO FRY MY INSTRUMENTS.
                         AS IT WAS I BUSTED UP THE SKYHOPPER
                         PRETTY BAD. UNCLE OWEN WAS PRETTY
                         UPSET. HE GROUNDED ME FOR THE REST
                         OF THE SEASON. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
                         THERE... IT WAS FANTASTIC.

                                     BIGGS
                         YOU OUGHT TO TAKE IT EASY LUKE. YOU
                         MAY BE THE HOTTEST BUSHPILOT THIS
                         SIDE OF MOS EISLEY, BUT THOSE LITTLE
                         SKYHOPPERS ARE DANGEROUS. KEEP IT
                         UP, AND ONE DAY, WHAMMO, YOU'RE GOING
                         TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A DARK SPOT
                         ON THE DOWN SIDE OF A CANYON WALL.

                                     LUKE
                         LOOK WHO'S TALKING. NOW THAT YOU'VE
                         BEEN AROUND THOSE GIANT STARSHIPS
                         YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SOUND LIKE MY
                         UNCLE. YOU'VE GOTTEN SOFT IN THE
                         CITY...

                                     BIGGS
                         I'VE MISSED YOU KID.

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN THE SAME
                         SINCE YOU LEFT, BIGGS. IT'S BEEN
                         SO... QUIET.

               BIGGS LOOKS AROUND THEN LEANS CLOSE TO LUKE.

                                     BIGGS
                         LUKE, I DIDN'T COME BACK JUST TO SAY
                         GOOD-BYE... I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU
                         THIS, BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I CAN
                         TRUST... AND IF I DON'T COME BACK, I
                         WANT SOMEBODY TO KNOW.

               LUKE'S EYES ARE WIDE WITH BIGGS' SERIOUSNESS AND LOYALTY.

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

                                     BIGGS
                         I MADE SOME FRIENDS AT THE ACADEMY.
                              (HE WHISPERS)
                         ...WHEN OUR FRIGATE GOES TO ONE OF
                         THE CENTRAL SYSTEMS, WE'RE GOING TO
                         JUMP SHIP AND JOIN THE ALLIANCE...

               LUKE, AMAZED AND STUNNED, IS ALMOST SPEECHLESS.

                                     LUKE
                         JOIN THE REBELLION?! ARE YOU KIDDING!
                         HOW?

                                     BIGGS
                         QUIET DOWN WILL YA! YOU GOT A MOUTH
                         BIGGER THAN A METEOR CRATER!

                                     LUKE
                         I'M SORRY. I'M QUIET.
                              (HE WHISPERS)
                         LISTEN HOW QUIET I AM. YOU CAN BARELY
                         HEAR ME...

               BIGGS SHAKES HIS HEAD ANGRILY AND THEN CONTINUES.

                                     BIGGS
                         MY FRIEND HAS A FRIEND ON BESTINE
                         WHO MIGHT HELP US MAKE CONTACT.

                                     LUKE
                         YOU'RE CRAZY! YOU COULD WANDER AROUND
                         FOREVER TRYING TO FIND THEM.

                                     BIGGS
                         I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT, BUT IF I
                         DON'T FIND THEM I'LL DO WHAT I CAN
                         ON MY OWN... IT'S WHAT WE ALWAYS
                         TALKED ABOUT. LUKE, I'M NOT GOING TO
                         WAIT FOR THE EMPIRE TO DRAFT ME INTO
                         SERVICE. THE REBELLION IS SPREADING
                         AND I WANT TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE --
                         THE SIDE I BELIEVE IN.

                                     LUKE
                         AND I'M STUCK HERE...

                                     BIGGS
                         I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO THE
                         ACADEMY NEXT TERM. YOU'LL GET YOUR
                         CHANCE TO GET OFF THIS ROCK.

                                     LUKE
                         NOT LIKELY! I HAD TO CANCEL MY
                         APPLICATION. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF
                         UNREST AMONG THE SANDPEOPLE SINCE
                         YOU LEFT... THEY'VE EVEN RAIDED THE
                         OUTSKIRTS OF ANCHORHEAD.

                                     BIGGS
                         YOUR UNCLE COULD HOLD OFF A WHOLE
                         COLONY OF SANDPEOPLE WITH ONE BLASTER.

                                     LUKE
                         I KNOW, BUT HE'S GOT ENOUGH VAPORATORS
                         GOING TO MAKE THE PLACE PAY OFF. HE
                         NEEDS ME FOR JUST ONE MORE SEASON. I
                         CAN'T LEAVE HIM NOW.

                                     BIGGS
                         I FEEL FOR YOU, LUKE, YOU'RE GOING
                         TO HAVE TO LEARN WHAT SEEMS TO BE
                         IMPORTANT OR WHAT REALLY IS IMPORTANT.
                         WHAT GOOD IS ALL YOUR UNCLE'S WORK
                         IF IT'S TAKEN OVER BY THE EMPIRE?...
                         YOU KNOW THEY'RE STARTING TO
                         NATIONALIZE COMMERCE IN THE CENTRAL
                         SYSTEMS... IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE
                         YOUR UNCLE IS MERELY A TENANT, SLAVING
                         FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF THE EMPIRE.

                                     LUKE
                         IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE. YOU SAID IT
                         YOURSELF. THE EMPIRE WON'T BOTHER
                         WITH THIS ROCK.

                                     BIGGS
                         THINGS ALWAYS CHANGE.

                                     LUKE
                         I WISH I WAS GOING... ARE YOU GOING
                         TO BE AROUND LONG?

                                     BIGGS
                         NO, I'M LEAVING IN THE MORNING...

                                     LUKE
                         THEN I GUESS I WON'T SEE YOU.

                                     BIGGS
                         MAYBE SOMEDAY... I'LL KEEP A LOOKOUT.

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, I'LL BE AT THE ACADEMY NEXT
                         SEASON... AFTER THAT WHO KNOWS. I
                         WON'T BE DRAFTED INTO THE IMPERIAL
                         STARFLEET THAT'S FOR SURE... TAKE
                         CARE OF YOURSELF, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
                         THE BEST FRIEND I'VE GOT.

                                     BIGGS
                         SO LONG, LUKE.

               BIGGS TURNS AWAY FROM HIS OLD FRIEND AND HEADS TOWARDS THE
               POWER STATION.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET

               THE GARGANTUAN ROCK FORMATIONS ARE SHROUDED IN A STRANGE
               FOREBODING MIST AND THE ONIMOUS SOUNDS OF UNEARTHLY CREATURES
               FILL THE AIR. ARTOO MOVES CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE CREEPY ROCK
               CANYON, INADVERTENTLY MAKING A LOUD CLICKING NOISE AS HE
               GOES. HE HEARS A DISTANT, HARD, METALLIC SOUND AND STOPS FOR
               A MOMENT. CONVINCED HE IS ALONE, HE CONTINUES ON HIS WAY.

               IN THE DISTANCE, A PEBBLE TUMBLES DOWN THE STEEP CANYON WALL
               AND A SMALL DARK FIGURE DARTS INTO THE SHADOWS. A LITTLE
               FURTHER UP THE CANYON A SLIGHT FLICKER OF LIGHT REVEALS A
               PAIR OF EYES IN THE DARK RECESSES ONLY A FEW FEET FROM THE
               NARROW PATH.

               THE UNSUSPECTING ROBOT WADDLES ALONG THE RUGGED TRAIL UNTIL
               SUDDENLY, OUT OF NOWHERE, A POWERFUL MAGNETIC RAY SHOOTS OUT
               OF THE ROCKS AND ENGULFS HIM IN AN EERIE GLOW. HE MANAGES
               ONE SHORT ELECTRONIC SQUEAK BEFORE HE TOPPLES OVER ONTO HIS
               BACK. HIS BRIGHT COMPUTER LIGHTS FLICKER OFF, THEN ON, THEN
               OFF AGAIN. OUT OF THE ROCKS SCURRY THREE JAWAS, NO TALLER
               THAN ARTOO. THEY HOLSTER STRANGE AND COMPLEX WEAPONS AS THEY
               CAUTIOUSLY APPROACH THE ROBOT. THEY WEAR GRUBBY CLOAKS AND
               THEIR FACES ARE SHROUDED SO ONLY THEIR GLOWING EYES CAN BE
               SEEN. THEY HISS AND MAKE ODD GUTTURAL SOUNDS AS THEY HEAVE
               THE HEAVY ROBOT ONTO THEIR SHOULDERS AND CARRY HIM OFF DOWN
               THE TRAIL.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

               THE EIGHT JAWAS CARRY ARTOO OUT OF THE CANYON TO A HUGE TANK-
               LIKE VEHICLE THE SIZE OF A FOUR-STORY HOUSE. THEY WELD A
               SMALL DISK ON THE SIDE OF ARTOO AND THEN PUT HIM UNDER A
               LARGE TUBE ON THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND THE LITTLE ROBOT
               IS SUCKED INTO THE GIANT MACHINE.

               THE FILTHY LITTLE JAWAS SCURRY LIKE RATS UP SMALL LADDERS
               AND ENTER THE MAIN CABIN OF THE BEHEMOTH TRANSPORT.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA

               IT IS DIM INSIDE THE HOLD AREA OF THE SANDCRAWLER. ARTOO
               SWITCHES ON A SMALL FLOODLIGHT ON HIS FOREHEAD AND STUMBLES
               AROUND THE SCRAP HEAP. THE NARROW BEAM SWINGS ACROSS RUSTY
               METAL ROCKET PARTS AND AN ARRAY OF GROTESQUELY TWISTED AND
               MAIMED ASTRO-ROBOTS. HE LETS OUT A PATHETIC ELECTRONIC WHIMPER
               AND STUMBLES OFF TOWARD WHAT APPEARS TO BE A DOOR AT THE END
               OF THE CHAMBER.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA

               ARTOO ENTERS A WIDE ROOM WITH A FOUR-FOOT CEILING. IN THE
               MIDDLE OF THE SCRAP HEAP SIT A DOZEN OR SO ROBOTS OF VARIOUS
               SHAPES AND SIZES. SOME ARE ENGAGED IN ELECTRONIC CONVERSATION,
               WHILE OTHERS SIMPLY MILL ABOUT. A VOICE OF RECOGNITION CALLS
               OUT FROM THE GLOOM.

                                     THREEPIO
                         ARTOO-DETOO! IT'S YOU! IT'S YOU!

               A BATTERED THREEPIO SCRAMBLES UP TO ARTOO AND EMBRACES HIM.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

               THE ENORMOUS SANDCRAWLER LUMBERS OFF TOWARD THE MAGNIFICENT
               TWIN SUNS, WHICH ARE SLOWLY SETTING OVER A DISTANT MOUNTAIN
               RIDGE.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY

               FOUR IMPERIAL STORMTROOPERS MILL ABOUT IN FRONT OF THE HALF-
               BURIED LIFEPOD THAT BROUGHT ARTOO AND THREEPIO TO TATOOINE.
               A TROOPER YELLS TO AN OFFICER SOME DISTANCE AWAY.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         SOMEONE WAS IN THE POD. THE TRACKS
                         GO OFF IN THIS DIRECTION.

               A SECOND TROOPER PICKS A SMALL BIT OF METAL OUT OF THE SAND
               AND GIVES IT TO THE FIRST TROOPER.

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         LOOK, SIR -- DROIDS.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES

               THE SANDCRAWLER MOVES SLOWLY DOWN A GREAT SAND DUNE.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER

               THREEPIO AND ARTOO NOISILY BOUNCE ALONG INSIDE THE CRAMPED
               PRISON CHAMBER. ARTOO APPEARS TO BE SHUT OFF.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WAKE UP! WAKE UP!

               SUDDENLY THE SHAKING AND BOUNCING OF THE SANDCRAWLER STOPS,
               CREATING QUITE A COMMOTION AMONG THE MECHANICAL MEN.
               THREEPIO'S FIST BANGS THE HEAD OF ARTOO WHOSE COMPUTER LIGHTS
               POP ON AS HE BEGINS BEEPING. AT THE FAR END OF THE LONG
               CHAMBER A HATCH OPENS, FILLING THE CHAMBER WITH BLINDING
               WHITE LIGHT. A DOZEN OR SO JAWAS MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE
               ODD ASSORTMENT OF ROBOTS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WE'RE DOOMED.

               A JAWA STARTS MOVING TOWARD THEM.

                                     THREEPIO
                         DO YOU THINK THEY'LL MELT US DOWN?

               ARTOO RESPONDS, MAKING BEEPING SOUNDS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         DON'T SHOOT! DON'T SHOOT! WILL THIS
                         NEVER END?

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON

               THE JAWAS MUTTER GIBBERISH AS THEY BUSILY LINE UP THEIR
               BATTERED CAPTIVES, INCLUDING ARTOO AND THREEPIO, IN FRONT OF
               THE ENORMOUS SANDCRAWLER, WHICH IS PARKED BESIDE A SMALL
               HOMESTEAD CONSISTING OF THREE LARGE HOLES IN THE GROUND
               SURROUNDED BY SEVERAL TALL MOISTURE VAPORATORS AND ONE SMALL
               ADOBE BLOCK HOUSE.

               THE JAWAS SCURRY AROUND FUSSING OVER THE ROBOTS, STRAIGHTENING
               THEM UP OR BRUSHING SOME DUST FROM A DENTED METALLIC ELBOW.
               THE SHROUDED LITTLE CREATURES SMELL HORRIBLY, ATTRACTING
               SMALL INSECTS TO THE DARK AREAS WHEN THEIR MOUTHS AND NOSTRILS
               SHOULD BE.

               OUT OF THE SHADOWS OF A DINGY SIDE-BUILDING LIMPS OWEN LARS,
               A LARGE BURLY MAN IN HIS MID-FIFTIES. HIS REDDISH EYES ARE
               SUNKEN IN A DUST-COVERED FACE. AS THE FARMER CAREFULLY
               INSPECTS EACH ROBOT, HE IS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY HIS SLUMP-
               SHOULDERED NEPHEW, LUKE SKYWALKER. ONE OF THE VILE LITTLE
               JAWAS WALKS AHEAD OF THE FARMER SPOUTING AN ANIMATED SALES
               PITCH IN A QUEER, UNINTELLIGIBLE LANGUAGE.

               A VOICE CALLS OUT FROM ONE OF THE HUGE HOLES THAT FORM THE
               HOMESTEAD. LUKE GOES OVER TO THE EDGE AND SEES HIS AUNT BERU
               STANDING IN THE MAIN COURTYARD.

                                     BERU
                         LUKE, TELL OWEN THAT IF HE GETS A
                         TRANSLATOR TO BE SURE IT SPEAKS BOCCE.

                                     LUKE
                         IT LOOKS LIKE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OF
                         A CHOICE BUT I'LL REMIND HIM.

               LUKE RETURNS TO HIS UNCLE AS THEY LOOK OVER THE EQUIPMENT
               FOR SALE WITH THE JAWA LEADER.

                                     OWEN
                         I HAVE NO NEED FOR A PROTOCOL DROID.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (QUICKLY)
                         SIR -- NOT IN AN ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS
                         THIS -- THAT'S WHY I'VE ALSO BEEN
                         PROGRAMMED FOR OVER THIRTY SECONDARY
                         FUNCTIONS THAT...

                                     OWEN
                         WHAT I REALLY NEED IS A DROID THAT
                         UNDERSTANDS THE BINARY LANGUAGE OF
                         MOISTURE VAPORATORS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         VAPORATORS! SIR -- MY FIRST JOB WAS
                         PROGRAMMING BINARY LOAD LIFTER...
                         VERY SIMILAR TO YOUR VAPORATORS. YOU
                         COULD SAY...

                                     OWEN
                         DO YOU SPEAK BOCCE?

                                     THREEPIO
                         OF COURSE I CAN, SIR. IT'S LIKE A
                         SECOND LANGUAGE FOR ME... I'M AS
                         FLUENT IN BOCCE...

                                     OWEN
                         ALL RIGHT SHUT UP!
                              (TURNING TO JAWA)
                         I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         SHUTTING UP, SIR.

                                     OWEN
                         LUKE, TAKE THESE TWO OVER TO THE
                         GARAGE, WILL YOU? I WANT YOU TO HAVE
                         BOTH OF THEM CLEANED UP BEFORE DINNER.

                                     LUKE
                         BUT I WAS GOING INTO TOSHI STATION
                         TO PICK UP SOME POWER CONVERTERS...

                                     OWEN
                         YOU CAN WASTE TIME WITH YOUR FRIENDS
                         WHEN YOUR CHORES ARE DONE. NOW COME
                         ON, GET TO IT!

                                     LUKE
                         ALL RIGHT, COME ON! AND THE RED ONE,
                         COME ON. WELL, COME ON, RED, LET'S
                         GO.

               AS THE JAWAS START TO LEAD THE THREE REMAINING ROBOTS BACK
               INTO THE SANDCRAWLER, ARTOO LETS OUT A PATHETIC LITTLE BEEP
               AND STARTS AFTER HIS OLD FRIEND THREEPIO. HE IS RESTRAINED
               BY A SLIMY JAWA, WHO ZAPS HIM WITH A CONTROL BOX.

               OWEN IS NEGOTIATING WITH THE HEAD JAWA. LUKE AND THE TWO
               ROBOTS START OFF FOR THE GARAGE WHEN A PLATE POPS OFF THE
               HEAD OF THE RED ASTRO-DROID'S HEAD PLATE AND IT SPARKS WILDLY.

                                     LUKE
                         UNCLE OWEN...

                                     OWEN
                         YEAH?

                                     LUKE
                         THIS R2 UNIT HAS A BAD MOTIVATOR.
                         LOOK!

                                     OWEN
                              (TO THE HEAD JAWA)
                         HEY, WHAT'RE YOU TRYING TO PUSH ON
                         US?

               THE JAWA GOES INTO A LOUD SPIEL. MEANWHILE, ARTOO HAS SNEAKED
               OUT OF LINE AND IS MOVING UP AND DOWN TRYING TO ATTRACT
               ATTENTION. HE LETS OUT WITH A LOW WHISTLE. THREEPIO TAPS
               LUKE ON THE SHOULDER.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (POINTING TO ARTOO)
                         EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT THAT R2 UNIT IS
                         IN PRIME CONDITION. A REAL BARGAIN.

                                     LUKE
                         UNCLE OWEN...

                                     OWEN
                         YEAH?

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE?

                                     OWEN
                              (TO JAWA)
                         WHAT ABOUT THAT BLUE ONE? WE'LL TAKE
                         THAT ONE.

               WITH A LITTLE RELUCTANCE THE SCRUFFY DWARF TRADES THE DAMAGED
               ASTRO-DROID FOR ARTOO.

                                     LUKE
                         YEAH, TAKE IT AWAY.

                                     THREEPIO
                         UH, I'M QUITE SURE YOU'LL BE VERY
                         PLEASED WITH THAT ONE, SIR. HE REALLY
                         IS IN FIRST-CLASS CONDITION. I'VE
                         WORKED WITH HIM BEFORE. HERE HE COMES.

               OWEN PAYS OFF THE WHINING JAWA AS LUKE AND THE TWO ROBOTS
               TRUDGE OFF TOWARD A GRIMY HOMESTEAD ENTRY.

                                     LUKE
                         OKAY, LET'S GO.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (TO ARTOO)
                         NOW, DON'T YOU FORGET THIS! WHY I
                         SHOULD STICK MY NECK OUT FOR YOU IS
                         QUITE BEYOND MY CAPACITY!

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

               THE GARAGE IS CLUTTERED AND WORN, BUT A FRIENDLY PEACEFUL
               ATMOSPHERE PERMEATES THE LOW GREY CHAMBER. THREEPIO LOWERS
               HIMSELF INTO A LARGE TUB FILLED WITH WARM OIL. NEAR THE
               BATTERED LANDSPEEDER LITTLE ARTOO RESTS ON A LARGE BATTERY
               WITH A CORD TO HIS FACE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         THANK THE MAKER! THIS OIL BATH IS
                         GOING TO FEEL SO GOOD. I'VE GOT SUCH
                         A BAD CASE OF DUST CONTAMINATION, I
                         CAN BARELY MOVE!

               ARTOO BEEPS A MUFFLED REPLY. LUKE SEEMS TO BE LOST IN THOUGHT
               AS HE RUNS HIS HAND OVER THE DAMAGED FIN OF A SMALL TWO-MAN
               SKYHOPPER SPACESHIP RESTING IN A LOW HANGAR OFF THE GARAGE.
               FINALLY LUKE'S FRUSTRATIONS GET THE BETTER OF HIM AND HE
               SLAMS A WRENCH ACROSS THE WORKBENCH.

                                     LUKE
                         IT JUST ISN'T FAIR. OH, BIGGS IS
                         RIGHT. I'M NEVER GONNA GET OUT OF
                         HERE!

                                     THREEPIO
                         IS THERE ANYTHING I MIGHT DO TO HELP?

               LUKE GLANCES AT THE BATTERED ROBOT. A BIT OF HIS ANGER DRAINS
               AND A TINY SMILE CREEPS ACROSS HIS FACE.

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, NOT UNLESS YOU CAN ALTER TIME,
                         SPEED UP THE HARVEST, OR TELEPORT ME
                         OFF THIS ROCK!

                                     THREEPIO
                         I DON'T THINK SO, SIR. I'M ONLY A
                         DROID AND NOT VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE
                         ABOUT SUCH THINGS. NOT ON THIS PLANET,
                         ANYWAYS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'M
                         NOT EVEN SURE WHICH PLANET I'M ON.

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, IF THERE'S A BRIGHT CENTER TO
                         THE UNIVERSE, YOU'RE ON THE PLANET
                         THAT IT'S FARTHEST FROM.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I SEE, SIR.

                                     LUKE
                         UH, YOU CAN CALL ME LUKE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I SEE, SIR LUKE.

                                     LUKE
                              (LAUGHING)
                         JUST LUKE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         AND I AM SEE-THREEPIO, HUMAN-CYBORG
                         RELATIONS, AND THIS IS MY COUNTERPART,
                         ARTOO-DETOO.

                                     LUKE
                         HELLO.

               ARTOO BEEPS IN RESPONSE. LUKE UNPLUGS ARTOO AND BEGINS TO
               SCRAPE SEVERAL CONNECTORS ON THE ROBOT'S HEAD WITH A CHROME
               PICK. THREEPIO CLIMBS OUT OF THE OIL TUB AND BEGINS WIPING
               OIL FROM HIS BRONZE BODY.

                                     LUKE
                         YOU GOT A LOT OF CARBON SCORING HERE.
                         IT LOOKS LIKE YOU BOYS HAVE SEEN A
                         LOT OF ACTION.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WITH ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, SOMETIMES
                         I'M AMAZED WE'RE IN AS GOOD CONDITION
                         AS WE ARE, WHAT WITH THE REBELLION
                         AND ALL.

                                     LUKE
                         YOU KNOW OF THE REBELLION AGAINST
                         THE EMPIRE?

                                     THREEPIO
                         THAT'S HOW WE CAME TO BE IN YOUR
                         SERVICE, IF YOU TAKE MY MEANING,
                         SIR.

                                     LUKE
                         HAVE YOU BEEN IN MANY BATTLES?

                                     THREEPIO
                         SEVERAL, I THINK. ACTUALLY, THERE'S
                         NOT MUCH TO TELL. I'M NOT MUCH MORE
                         THAN AN INTERPRETER, AND NOT VERY
                         GOOD AT TELLING STORIES. WELL, NOT
                         AT MAKING THEM INTERESTING, ANYWAYS.

               LUKE STRUGGLES TO REMOVE A SMALL METAL FRAGMENT FROM ARTOO'S
               NECK JOINT. HE USES A LARGER PICK.

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, MY LITTLE FRIEND, YOU'VE GOT
                         SOMETHING JAMMED IN HERE REAL GOOD.
                         WERE YOU ON A CRUISER OR...

               THE FRAGMENT BREAKS LOOSE WITH A SNAP, SENDING LUKE TUMBLING
               HEAD OVER HEELS. HE SITS UP AND SEES A TWELVE-INCH THREE-
               DIMENSIONAL HOLOGRAM OF LEIA ORGANA, THE REBEL SENATOR, BEING
               PROJECTED FROM THE FACE OF LITTLE ARTOO. THE IMAGE IS A
               RAINBOW OF COLORS AS IT FLICKERS AND JIGGLES IN THE DIMLY
               LIT GARAGE. LUKE'S MOUTH HANGS OPEN IN AWE.

                                     LEIA
                         HELP ME, OBI-WAN KENOBI. YOU'RE MY
                         ONLY HOPE.

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT'S THIS?

               ARTOO LOOKS AROUND AND SHEEPISHLY BEEPS AN ANSWER FOR THREEPIO
               TO TRANSLATE. LEIA CONTINUES TO REPEAT THE SENTENCE FRAGMENT
               OVER AND OVER.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WHAT IS WHAT?!? HE ASKED YOU A
                         QUESTION...
                              (POINTING TO LEIA)
                         WHAT IS THAT?

               ARTOO WHISTLES HIS SURPRISE AS HE PRETENDS TO JUST NOTICE
               THE HOLOGRAM. HE LOOKS AROUND AND SHEEPISHLY BEEPS AN ANSWER
               FOR THREEPIO TO TRANSLATE. LEIA CONTINUES TO REPEAT THE
               SENTENCE FRAGMENT OVER AND OVER.

                         YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         OH, HE SAYS IT'S NOTHING, SIR. MERELY
                         A MALFUNCTION. OLD DATA. PAY IT NO
                         MIND.

               LUKE BECOMES INTRIGUED BY THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

                                     LUKE
                         WHO IS SHE? SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'M AFRAID I'M NOT QUITE SURE, SIR.

                                     LEIA
                         HELP ME, OBI-WAN KENOBI...

                                     THREEPIO
                         I THINK SHE WAS A PASSENGER ON OUR
                         LAST VOYAGE. A PERSON OF SOME
                         IMPORTANCE, SIR -- I BELIEVE. OUR
                         CAPTAIN WAS ATTACHED TO...

                                     LUKE
                         IS THERE MORE TO THIS RECORDING?

               LUKE REACHES OUT FOR ARTOO BUT HE LETS OUT SEVERAL FRANTIC
               SQUEAKS AND A WHISTLE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         BEHAVE YOURSELF, ARTOO. YOU'RE GOING
                         TO GET US IN TROUBLE. IT'S ALL RIGHT,
                         YOU CAN TRUST HIM. HE'S OUR NEW
                         MASTER.

               ARTOO WHISTLES AND BEEPS A LONG MESSAGE TO THREEPIO.

                                     THREEPIO
                         HE SAYS HE'S THE PROPERTY OF OBI-WAN
                         KENOBI, A RESIDENT OF THESE PARTS.
                         AND IT'S A PRIVATE MESSAGE FOR HIM.
                         QUITE FRANKLY, SIR I DON'T KNOW WHAT
                         HE'S TALKING ABOUT. OUR LAST MASTER
                         WAS CAPTAIN ANTILLES, BUT WITH WHAT
                         WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, THIS LITTLE R2
                         UNIT HAS BECOME A BIT ECCENTRIC.

                                     LUKE
                         OBI-WAN KENOBI? I WONDER IF HE MEANS
                         OLD BEN KENOBI?

                                     THREEPIO
                         I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR, BUT DO YOU
                         KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT?

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, I DON'T KNOW ANYONE NAMED OBI-
                         WAN, BUT OLD BEN LIVES OUT BEYOND
                         THE DUNE SEA. HE'S KIND OF A STRANGE
                         OLD HERMIT.

               LUKE'S GAZES AT THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PRINCESS FOR A FEW
               MOMENTS.

                                     LUKE
                         I WONDER WHO SHE IS. IT SOUNDS LIKE
                         SHE'S IN TROUBLE. I'D BETTER PLAY
                         BACK THE WHOLE THING.

               ARTOO BEEPS SOMETHING TO THREEPIO.

                                     THREEPIO
                         HE SAYS THE RESTRAINING BOLT HAS
                         SHORT CIRCUITED HIS RECORDING SYSTEM.
                         HE SUGGESTS THAT IF YOU REMOVE THE
                         BOLT, HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PLAY BACK
                         THE ENTIRE RECORDING.

               LUKE LOOKS LONGINGLY AT THE LOVELY, LITTLE PRINCESS AND HASN'T
               REALLY HEARD WHAT THREEPIO HAS BEEN SAYING.

                                     LUKE
                         H'M? OH, YEAH, WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE
                         TOO SMALL TO RUN AWAY ON ME IF I
                         TAKE THIS OFF! OKAY.

               LUKE TAKES A WEDGED BAR AND POPS THE RESTRAINING BOLT OFF
               ARTOO'S SIDE.

                                     LUKE
                         THERE YOU GO.

               THE PRINCESS IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARS...

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, WAIT A MINUTE. WHERE'D SHE GO?
                         BRING HER BACK! PLAY BACK THE ENTIRE
                         MESSAGE.

               ARTOO BEEPS AN INNOCENT REPLY AS THREEPIO SITS UP IN
               EMBARRASSMENT.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WHAT MESSAGE? THE ONE YOU'RE CARRYING
                         INSIDE YOUR RUSTY INNARDS!

               A WOMEN'S VOICE CALLS OUT FROM ANOTHER ROOM.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         LUKE? LUKE! COME TO DINNER!

               LUKE STANDS UP AND SHAKES HIS HEAD AT THE MALFUNCTIONING
               ROBOT.

                                     LUKE
                         ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, AUNT
                         BERU.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT HE APPEARS TO
                         HAVE PICKED UP A SLIGHT FLUTTER.

               LUKE TOSSES ARTOO'S RESTRAINING BOLT ON THE WORKBENCH AND
               HURRIES OUT OF THE ROOM.

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH HIM.
                         I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (TO ARTOO)
                         JUST YOU RECONSIDER PLAYING THAT
                         MESSAGE FOR HIM.

               ARTOO BEEPS IN RESPONSE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         NO, I DON'T THINK HE LIKES YOU AT
                         ALL.

               ARTOO BEEPS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         NO, I DON'T LIKE YOU EITHER.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA

               LUKE'S AUNT BERU, A WARM, MOTHERLY WOMAN, FILLS A PITCHER
               WITH BLUE FLUID FROM A REFRIGERATED CONTAINER IN THE WELL-
               USED KITCHEN. SHE PUTS THE PITCHER ON A TRAY WITH SOME BOWLS
               OF FOOD AND STARTS FOR THE DINING AREA.

               LUKE SITS WITH HIS UNCLE OWEN BEFORE A TABLE COVERED WITH
               STEAMING BOWLS OF FOOD AS AUNT BERU CARRIES IN A BOWL OF RED
               GRAIN.

                                     LUKE
                         YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT R2 UNIT WE
                         BOUGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

                                     OWEN
                         WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, I STUMBLED ACROSS A RECORDING
                         WHILE I WAS CLEANING HIM. HE SAYS HE
                         BELONGS TO SOMEONE CALLED OBI-WAN
                         KENOBI.

               OWEN IS GREATLY ALARMED AT THE MENTION OF HIS NAME, BUT
               MANAGES TO CONTROL HIMSELF.

                                     LUKE
                         I THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE MEANT OLD
                         BEN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING
                         ABOUT? WELL, I WONDER IF HE'S RELATED
                         TO BEN.

               OWEN BREAKS LOOSE WITH A FIT OF UNCONTROLLED ANGER.

                                     OWEN
                         THAT OLD MAN'S JUST A CRAZY OLD
                         WIZARD. TOMORROW I WANT YOU TO TAKE
                         THAT R2 UNIT INTO ANCHORHEAD AND
                         HAVE ITS MEMORY FLUSHED. THAT'LL BE
                         THE END OF IT. IT BELONGS TO US NOW.

                                     LUKE
                         BUT WHAT IF THIS OBI-WAN COMES LOOKING
                         FOR HIM?

                                     OWEN
                         HE WON'T, I DON'T THINK HE EXISTS
                         ANY MORE. HE DIED ABOUT THE SAME
                         TIME AS YOUR FATHER.

                                     LUKE
                         HE KNEW MY FATHER?

                                     OWEN
                         I TOLD YOU TO FORGET IT. YOUR ONLY
                         CONCERN IS TO PREPARE THE NEW DROIDS
                         FOR TOMORROW. IN THE MORNING I WANT
                         THEM ON THE SOUTH RIDGE WORKING OUT
                         THOSE CONDENSERS.

                                     LUKE
                         YES, SIR. I THINK THOSE NEW DROIDS
                         ARE GOING TO WORK OUT FINE. IN FACT,
                         I, UH, WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT OUR
                         AGREEMENT ABOUT MY STAYING ON ANOTHER
                         SEASON. AND IF THESE NEW DROIDS DO
                         WORK OUT, I WANT TO TRANSMIT MY
                         APPLICATION TO THE ACADEMY THIS YEAR.

               OWEN'S FACE BECOMES A SCOWL, ALTHOUGH HE TRIES TO SUPPRESS
               IT.

                                     OWEN
                         YOU MEAN THE NEXT SEMESTER BEFORE
                         HARVEST?

                                     LUKE
                         SURE, THERE'RE MORE THAN ENOUGH
                         DROIDS.

                                     OWEN
                         HARVEST IS WHEN I NEED YOU THE MOST.
                         ONLY ONE MORE SEASON. THIS YEAR WE'LL
                         MAKE ENOUGH ON THE HARVEST SO I'LL
                         BE ABLE TO HIRE SOME MORE HANDS. AND
                         THEN YOU CAN GO TO THE ACADEMY NEXT
                         YEAR.

               LUKE CONTINUES TO TOY WITH HIS FOOD, NOT LOOKING AT HIS UNCLE.

                                     OWEN
                         YOU MUST UNDERSTAND I NEED YOU HERE,
                         LUKE.

                                     LUKE
                         BUT IT'S A WHOLE 'NOTHER YEAR.

                                     OWEN
                         LOOK, IT'S ONLY ONE MORE SEASON.

               LUKE PUSHES HIS HALF-EATEN PLATE OF FOOD ASIDE AND STANDS.

                                     LUKE
                         YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID LAST YEAR
                         WHEN BIGGS AND TANK LEFT.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

                                     LUKE
                         IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING NOWHERE. I
                         HAVE TO FINISH CLEANING THOSE DROIDS.

               RESIGNED TO HIS FATE, LUKE PADDLES OUT OF THE ROOM. OWEN
               MECHANICALLY FINISHES HIS DINNER.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         OWEN, HE CAN'T STAY HERE FOREVER.
                         MOST OF HIS FRIENDS HAVE GONE. IT
                         MEANS SO MUCH TO HIM.

                                     OWEN
                         I'LL MAKE IT UP TO HIM NEXT YEAR. I
                         PROMISE.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         LUKE'S JUST NOT A FARMER, OWEN. HE
                         HAS TOO MUCH OF HIS FATHER IN HIM.

                                     OWEN
                         THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               THE GIANT TWIN SUNS OF TATOOINE SLOWLY DISAPPEAR BEHIND A
               DISTANT DUNE RANGE. LUKE STANDS WATCHING THEM FOR A FEW
               MOMENTS, THEN RELUCTANTLY ENTERS THE DOOMED ENTRANCE TO THE
               HOMESTEAD.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE

               LUKE ENTERS THE GARAGE TO DISCOVER THE ROBOTS NOWHERE IN
               SIGHT. HE TAKES A SMALL CONTROL BOX FROM HIS UTILITY BELT
               SIMILAR TO THE ONE THE JAWAS WERE CARRYING. HE ACTIVATES THE
               BOX, WHICH CREATES A LOW HUM, AND THREEPIO, LETTING OUT A
               SHORT YELL, POPS UP FROM BEHIND THE SKYHOPPER SPACESHIP.

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT ARE YOU DOING HIDING THERE?

               THREEPIO STUMBLES FORWARD, BUT ARTOO IS STILL NOWHERE IN
               SIGHT.

                                     THREEPIO
                         IT WASN'T MY FAULT, SIR. PLEASE DON'T
                         DEACTIVATE ME. I TOLD HIM NOT TO GO,
                         BUT HE'S FAULTY, MALFUNCTIONING;
                         KEPT BABBLING ON ABOUT HIS MISSION.

                                     LUKE
                         OH, NO!

               LUKE RACES OUT OF THE GARAGE FOLLOWED BY THREEPIO.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               LUKE RUSHES OUT OF THE SMALL DOOMED ENTRY TO THE HOMESTEAD
               AND SEARCHES THE DARKENING HORIZON FOR THE SMALL TRIPED ASTRO-
               ROBOT. THREEPIO STRUGGLES OUT OF THE HOMESTEAD AND ON THE
               SALT FLAT AS LUKE SCANS THE LANDSCAPE WITH HIS
               ELECTROBINOCULARS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         THAT R2 UNIT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A
                         PROBLEM. THESE ASTRO-DROIDS ARE
                         GETTING QUITE OUT OF HAND. EVEN I
                         CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEIR LOGIC AT TIMES.

                                     LUKE
                         HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID? HE'S NOWHERE
                         IN SIGHT. BLAST IT!

                                     THREEPIO
                         PARDON ME, SIR, BUT COULDN'T WE GO
                         AFTER HIM?

                                     LUKE
                         IT'S TOO DANGEROUS WITH ALL THE
                         SANDPEOPLE AROUND. WE'LL HAVE TO
                         WAIT UNTIL MORNING.

               OWEN YELLS UP FROM THE HOMESTEAD PLAZA.

                                     OWEN
                         LUKE, I'M SHUTTING THE POWER DOWN
                         FOR THE NIGHT.

                                     LUKE
                         ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE THERE IN A FEW
                         MINUTES. BOY, AM I GONNA GET IT.

               HE TAKES ONE FINAL LOOK ACROSS THE DIM HORIZON.

                                     LUKE
                         YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE DROID IS GOING
                         TO CAUSE ME A LOT OF TROUBLE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         OH, HE EXCELS AT THAT, SIR.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA

               MORNING SLOWLY CREEPS INTO THE SPARSE BUT SPARKLING OASIS OF
               THE OPEN COURTYARD. THE IDYLL IS BROKEN BE THE YELLING OF
               UNCLE OWEN, HIS VOICE ECHOING THROUGHOUT THE HOMESTEAD.

                                     OWEN
                         LUKE? LUKE? LUKE? WHERE COULD HE BE
                         LOAFING NOW!

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN

               THE INTERIOR OF THE KITCHEN IS A WORM GLOW AS AUNT BERU
               PREPARES THE MORNING BREAKFAST. OWEN ENTERS IN A HUFF.

                                     OWEN
                         HAVE YOU SEEN LUKE THIS MORNING?

                                     AUNT BERU
                         HE SAID HE HAD SOME THINGS TO DO
                         BEFORE HE STARTED TODAY, SO HE LEFT
                         EARLY.

                                     OWEN
                         UH? DID HE TAKE THOSE TWO NEW DROIDS
                         WITH HIM?

                                     AUNT BERU
                         I THINK SO.

                                     OWEN
                         WELL, HE'D BETTER HAVE THOSE UNITS
                         IN THE SOUTH RANGE REPAIRED BE MIDDAY
                         OR THERE'LL BE HELL TO PAY!

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY

               THE ROCK AND SAND OF THE DESERT FLOOR ARE A BLUR AS THREEPIO
               PILOTS THE SLEEK LANDSPEEDER GRACEFULLY ACROSS THE VAST
               WASTELAND.

               INT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING -
               DAY

               LUKE LEANS OVER THE BACK OF THE SPEEDER AND ADJUSTS SOMETHING
               IN THE MOTOR COMPARTMENT.

                                     LUKE
                              (YELLING)
                         HOW'S THAT.

               THREEPIO SIGNALS THAT IS FINE AND LUKE TURNS BACK INTO THE
               WIND-WHIPPED COCKPIT AND POPS THE CANOPY SHUT.

                                     LUKE
                         OLD BEN KENOBI LIVES OUT IN THIS
                         DIRECTION SOMEWHERE, BUT I DON'T SEE
                         HOW THAT R2 UNIT COULD HAVE COME
                         THIS FAR. WE MUST HAVE MISSED HIM.
                         UNCLE OWEN ISN'T GOING TO TAKE THIS
                         VERY WELL.

                                     THREEPIO
                         SIR, WOULD IT HELP IF YOU TOLD HIM
                         IT WAS MY FAULT.

                                     LUKE
                              (BRIGHTENING)
                         SURE. HE NEEDS YOU. HE'D PROBABLY
                         ONLY DEACTIVATE YOU FOR A DAY OR
                         SO...

                                     THREEPIO
                         DEACTIVATE! WELL, ON THE OTHER HAND
                         IF YOU HADN'T REMOVED HIS RESTRAINING
                         BOLT...

                                     LUKE
                         WAIT, THERE'S SOMETHING DEAD AHEAD
                         ON THE SCANNER. IT LOOKS LIKE OUR
                         DROID... HIT THE ACCELERATOR.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY

               FROM HIGH ON A ROCK MESA, THE TINY LANDSPEEDER CAN BE SEEN
               GLIDING ACROSS THE DESERT FLOOR. SUDDENLY IN THE FOREGROUND
               TWO WEATHER-BEATEN SANDPEOPLE SHROUDED IN THEIR GRIMY DESERT
               CLOAKS PEER OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROCK MESA. ONE OF THE
               MARGINALLY HUMAN CREATURES RAISES A LONG OMINOUS LASER RIFLE
               AND POINTS IT AT THE SPEEDER BUT THE SECOND CREATURE GRABS
               THE GUN BEFORE IT CAN BE FIRED.

               THE SANDPEOPLE, OR TUSKEN RAIDERS AS THEY'RE SOMETIMES CALLED,
               SPEAK IN A COARSE BARBARIC LANGUAGE AS THEY GET INTO AN
               ANIMATED ARGUMENT. THE SECOND TUSKEN RAIDER SEEMS TO GET IN
               THE FINAL WORD AND THE NOMADS SCURRY OVER THE ROCKY TERRAIN.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON

               THE TUSKEN RAIDER APPROACHES TWO LARGE BANTHAS STANDING TIED
               TO A ROCK. THE MONSTROUS, BEAR-LIKE CREATURES ARE AS LARGE
               AS ELEPHANTS, WITH HUGE RED EYES, TREMENDOUS LOOPED HORNS,
               AND LONG, FURRY, DINOSAUR-LIKE TAILS. THE TUSKEN RAIDERS
               MOUNT SADDLES STRAPPED TO THE HUGE CREATURES' SHAGGY BACKS
               AND RIDE OFF DOWN THE RUGGED BLUFF.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR

               THE SPEEDER IS PARKED ON THE FLOOR OF A MASSIVE CANYON. LUKE,
               WITH HIS LONG LASER RIFLE SLUNG OVER HIS SHOULDER, STANDS
               BEFORE LITTLE ARTOO.

                                     LUKE
                         HEY, WHOA, JUST WHERE DO YOU THINK
                         YOU'RE GOING?

               THE LITTLE DROID WHISTLES A FEEBLE REPLY, AS THREEPIO POSES
               MENACINGLY BEHIND THE LITTLE RUNAWAY.

                                     THREEPIO
                         MASTER LUKE HERE IS YOUR RIGHTFUL
                         OWNER. WE'LL HAVE NO MORE OF THIS
                         OBI-WAN KENOBI JIBBERISH... AND DON'T
                         TALK TO ME ABOUT YOUR MISSION, EITHER.
                         YOU'RE FORTUNATE HE DOESN'T BLAST
                         YOU INTO A MILLION PIECES RIGHT HERE.

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, COME ON. IT'S GETTING LATE. I
                         ONLY HOPE WE CAN GET BACK BEFORE
                         UNCLE OWEN REALLY BLOWS UP.

                                     THREEPIO
                         IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING SO, SIR,
                         I THINK YOU SHOULD DEACTIVATE THE
                         LITTLE FUGITIVE UNTIL YOU'VE GOTTEN
                         HIM BACK TO YOUR WORKSHOP.

                                     LUKE
                         NO, HE'S NOT GOING TO TRY ANYTHING.

               SUDDENLY THE LITTLE ROBOT JUMPS TO LIFE WITH A MASS OF FRANTIC
               WHISTLES AND SCREAMS.

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM NOW?

                                     THREEPIO
                         OH MY... SIR, HE SAYS THERE ARE
                         SEVERAL CREATURES APPROACHING FROM
                         THE SOUTHEAST.

               LUKE SWINGS HIS RIFLE INTO POSITION AND LOOKS TO THE SOUTH.

                                     LUKE
                         SANDPEOPLE! OR WORST! COME ON, LET'S
                         HAVE A LOOK. COME ON.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY

               LUKE CAREFULLY MAKES HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF A ROCK RIDGE AND
               SCANS THE CANYON WITH HIS ELECTROBINOCULARS. HE SPOTS THE
               TWO RIDERLESS BANTHAS. THREEPIO STRUGGLES UP BEHIND THE YOUNG
               ADVENTURER.

                                     LUKE
                         THERE ARE TWO BANTHAS DOWN THERE BUT
                         I DON'T SEE ANY... WAIT A SECOND,
                         THEY'RE SANDPEOPLE ALL RIGHT. I CAN
                         SEE ONE OF THEM NOW.

               LUKE WATCHES THE DISTANT TUSKEN RAIDER THROUGH HIS
               ELECTROBINOCULARS. SUDDENLY SOMETHING HUGE MOVES IN FRONT OF
               HIS FIELD OF VIEW. BEFORE LUKE OR THREEPIO CAN REACT, A LARGE,
               GRUESOME TUSKEN RAIDER LOOMS OVER THEM. THREEPIO IS STARTLED
               AND BACKS AWAY, RIGHT OFF THE SIDE IF THE CLIFF. HE CAN BE
               HEARD FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS AS HE CLANGS, BANGS AND RATTLES
               DOWN THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.

               THE TOWERING CREATURE BRINGS DOWN HIS CURVED, DOUBLE-POINTED
               GADERFFII -- THE DREADED AXE BLADE THAT HAS STRUCK TERROR IN
               THE HEART OF THE LOCAL SETTLERS. BUT LUKE MANAGES TO BLOCK
               THE BLOW WITH HIS LASER RIFLE, WHICH IS SMASHED TO PIECES.
               THE TERRIFIED FARM BOY SCRAMBLES BACKWARD UNTIL HE IS FORCED
               TO THE EDGE OF A DEEP CREVICE. THE SINISTER RAIDER STANDS
               OVER HIM WITH HIS WEAPON RAISED AND LETS OUT A HORRIBLE
               SHRIEKING LAUGH.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY

               ARTOO FORCES HIMSELF INTO THE SHADOWS OF A SMALL ALCOVE IN
               THE ROCKS AS THE VICIOUS SANDPEOPLE WALK PAST CARRYING THE
               INERT LUKE SKYWALKER, WHO IS DROPPED IN A HEAP BEFORE THE
               SPEEDER.  THE SANDPEOPLE RANSACK THE SPEEDER, THROWING PARTS
               AND SUPPLIES IN ALL DIRECTIONS. SUDDENLY THEY STOP. THEN
               EVERYTHING IS QUIET FOR A FEW MOMENTS. A GREAT HOWLING MOAN
               IS HEARD ECHOING THROUGHOUT THE CANYON WHICH SENDS THE
               SANDPEOPLE FLEEING IN TERROR.

               ARTOO MOVES EVEN TIGHTER INTO THE SHADOWS AS THE SLIGHT
               SWISHING SOUND THAT FRIGHTENED OFF THE SANDPEOPLE GROWS EVEN
               CLOSER, UNTIL A SHABBY OLD DESERT-RAT-OF-A-MAN APPEARS AND
               LEANS OVER LUKE. HIS ANCIENT LEATHERY FACE, CRACKED AND
               WEATHERED BY EXOTIC CLIMATES IS SET OFF BY DARK, PENETRATING
               EYES AND A SCRAGGLY WHITE BEARD. BEN KENOBI SQUINTS HIS EYES
               AS HE SCRUTINIZES THE UNCONSCIOUS FARM BOY. ARTOO MAKES A
               SLIGHT SOUND AND BEN TURNS AND LOOKS RIGHT AT HIM.

                                     BEN
                         HELLO THERE! COME HERE MY LITTLE
                         FRIEND. DON'T BE AFRAID.

               ARTOO WADDLES OVER TO WERE LUKE LIES CRUMPLED IN A HEAP AND
               BEGINS TO WHISTLE AND BEEP HIS CONCERN. BEN PUTS HIS HAND ON
               LUKE'S FOREHEAD AND HE BEGINS TO COME AROUND.

                                     BEN
                         DON'T WORRY, HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT HAPPENED?

                                     BEN
                         REST EASY, SON, YOU'VE HAD A BUSY
                         DAY. YOU'RE FORTUNATE YOU'RE STILL
                         IN ONE PIECE.

                                     LUKE
                         BEN? BEN KENOBI! BOY, AM I GLAD TO
                         SEE YOU!

                                     BEN
                         THE JUNDLAND WASTES ARE NOT TO BE
                         TRAVELED LIGHTLY. TELL ME YOUNG LUKE,
                         WHAT BRINGS YOU OUT THIS FAR?

                                     LUKE
                         OH, THIS LITTLE DROID! I THINK HE'S
                         SEARCHING FOR HIS FORMER MASTER...
                         I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH DEVOTION IN A
                         DROID BEFORE... THERE SEEMS TO BE NO
                         STOPPING HIM. HE CLAIMS TO BE THE
                         PROPERTY OF AN OBI-WAN KENOBI. IS HE
                         A RELATIVE OF YOURS? DO YOU KNOW WHO
                         HE'S TALKING ABOUT?

               BEN PONDERS THIS FOR A MOMENT, SCRATCHING HIS SCRUFFY BEARD.

                                     BEN
                         OBI-WAN KENOBI... OBI-WAN? NOW THATS
                         A NAME I HAVEN'T HEARD IN A LONG
                         TIME... A LONG TIME.

                                     LUKE
                         I THINK MY UNCLE KNEW HIM. HE SAID
                         HE WAS DEAD.

                                     BEN
                         OH, HE'S NOT DEAD, NOT... NOT YET.

                                     LUKE
                         YOU KNOW HIM!

                                     BEN
                         WELL OF COURSE, OF COURSE I KNOW
                         HIM. HE'S ME! I HAVEN'T GONE BY THE
                         NAME OBI-WAN SINCE OH, BEFORE YOU
                         WERE BORN.

                                     LUKE
                         THEN THE DROID DOES BELONG TO YOU.

                                     BEN
                         DON'T SEEM TO REMEMBER EVER OWNING A
                         DROID. VERY INTERESTING...

               HE SUDDENLY LOOKS UP AT THE OVERHANGING CLIFFS.

                                     BEN
                         I THINK WE BETTER GET INDOORS. THE
                         SANDPEOPLE ARE EASILY STARTLED BUT
                         THEY WILL SOON BE BACK AND IN GREATER
                         NUMBERS.

               LUKE SITS UP AND RUBS HIS HEAD. ARTOO LETS OUT A PATHETIC
               BEEP CAUSING LUKE TO REMEMBER SOMETHING. HE LOOKS AROUND.

                                     LUKE
                         THREEPIO!

               EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY

               LITTLE ARTOO STANDS AT THE EDGE OF A LARGE SAND PIT AND BEGINS
               TO CHATTER AWAY IN ELECTRONIC WHISTLES AND BEEPS. LUKE AND
               BEN STAND OVER A VERY DENTED AND TANGLED THREEPIO LYING HALF
               BURIED IN THE SAND. ONE OF HIS ARMS HAS BROKEN OFF.

               LUKE TRIES TO REVIVE THE INERT ROBOT BY SHAKING HIM AND THEN
               FLIPS A HIDDEN SWITCH ON HIS BACK SEVERAL TIMES UNTIL FINALLY
               THE MECHANICAL MAN'S SYSTEMS TURN ON.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WHERE AM I? I MUST HAVE TAKEN A BAD
                         STEP...

                                     LUKE
                         CAN YOU STAND? WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT
                         OF HERE BEFORE THE SANDPEOPLE RETURN.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I DON'T THINK I CAN MAKE IT. YOU GO
                         ON, MASTER LUKE. THERE'S NO SENSE IN
                         YOU RISKING YOURSELF ON MY ACCOUNT.
                         I'M DONE FOR.

               ARTOO MAKES A BEEPING SOUND.

                                     LUKE
                         NO, YOU'RE NOT. WHAT KIND OF TALK IS
                         THAT?

               LUKE AND BEN HELP THE BATTERED ROBOT TO HIS FEET. LITTLE
               ARTOO WATCHES FROM THE TOP OF THE PIT. BEN GLANCES AROUND
               SUSPICIOUSLY. SENSING SOMETHING, HE STANDS UP AND SNIFFS THE
               AIR.

                                     BEN
                         QUICKLY, SON... THEY'RE ON THE MOVE.

               INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING

               THE SMALL, SPARTAN HOVEL IS CLUTTERED WITH DESERT JUNK BUT
               STILL MANAGES TO RADIATE AN AIR OF TIME-WORN COMFORT AND
               SECURITY. LUKE IS IN ONE CORNER REPAIRING THREEPIO'S ARM, AS
               OLD BEN SITS THINKING.

                                     LUKE
                         NO, MY FATHER DIDN'T FIGHT IN THE
                         WARS. HE WAS A NAVIGATOR ON A SPICE
                         FREIGHTER.

                                     BEN
                         THAT'S WHAT YOUR UNCLE TOLD YOU. HE
                         DIDN'T HOLD WITH YOUR FATHER'S IDEALS.
                         THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE STAYED HERE
                         AND NOT GOTTEN INVOLVED.

                                     LUKE
                         YOU FOUGHT IN THE CLONE WARS?

                                     BEN
                         YES, I WAS ONCE A JEDI KNIGHT THE
                         SAME AS YOUR FATHER.

                                     LUKE
                         I WISH I'D KNOWN HIM.

                                     BEN
                         HE WAS THE BEST STAR-PILOT IN THE
                         GALAXY, AND A CUNNING WARRIOR. I
                         UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BECOME QUITE A
                         GOOD PILOT YOURSELF. AND HE WAS A
                         GOOD FRIEND. WHICH REMINDS ME...

               BEN GETS UP AND GOES TO A CHEST WHERE HE RUMMAGES AROUND.
               AS LUKE FINISHES REPAIRING THREEPIO AND STARTS TO FIT THE
               RESTRAINING BOLT BACK ON, THREEPIO LOOKS AT HIM NERVOUSLY.
               LUKE THINKS ABOUT THE BOLT FOR A MOMENT THEN PUTS IT ON THE
               TABLE. BEN SHUFFLES UP AND PRESENTS LUKE WITH A SHORT HANDLE
               WITH SEVERAL ELECTRONIC GADGETS ATTACHED TO IT.

                                     BEN
                         I HAVE SOMETHING HERE FOR YOU. YOUR
                         FATHER WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS WHEN
                         YOU WERE OLD ENOUGH, BUT YOUR UNCLE
                         WOULDN'T ALLOW IT. HE FEARED YOU
                         MIGHT FOLLOW OLD OBI-WAN ON SOME
                         DAMNED-FOOL IDEALISTIC CRUSADE LIKE
                         YOUR FATHER DID.

                                     THREEPIO
                         SIR, IF YOU'LL NOT BE NEEDING ME,
                         I'LL CLOSE DOWN FOR AWHILE.

                                     LUKE
                         SURE, GO AHEAD.

               BEN HANDS LUKE THE SABER.

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT IS IT?

                                     BEN
                         YOUR FATHERS LIGHTSABER. THIS IS THE
                         WEAPON OF A JEDI KNIGHT. NOT AS CLUMSY
                         OR AS RANDOM AS A BLASTER.

               LUKE PUSHES A BUTTON ON THE HANDLE. A LONG BEAM SHOOTS OUT
               ABOUT FOUR FEET AND FLICKERS THERE. THE LIGHT PLAYS ACROSS
               THE CEILING.

                         AN ELEGANT WEAPON FOR A MORE CIVILIZED
                         TIME. FOR OVER A THOUSAND GENERATIONS
                         THE JEDI KNIGHTS WERE THE GUARDIANS
                         OF PEACE AND JUSTICE IN THE OLD
                         REPUBLIC. BEFORE THE DARK TIMES,
                         BEFORE THE EMPIRE.

               LUKE HASN'T REALLY BEEN LISTENING.

                         HOW DID MY FATHER DIE?

                         A YOUNG JEDI NAMED DARTH VADER, WHO
                         WAS A PUPIL OF MINE UNTIL HE TURNED
                         TO EVIL, HELPED THE EMPIRE HUNT DOWN
                         AND DESTROY THE JEDI KNIGHTS. HE
                         BETRAYED AND MURDERED YOUR FATHER.
                         NOW THE JEDI ARE ALL BUT EXTINCT.
                         VADER WAS SEDUCED BY THE DARK SIDE
                         OF THE FORCE.

                         WELL, THE FORCE IS WHAT GIVES A JEDI
                         HIS POWER. IT'S AN ENERGY FIELD
                         CREATED BY ALL LIVING THINGS. IT
                         SURROUNDS US AND PENETRATES US. IT
                         BINDS THE GALAXY TOGETHER.

               ARTOO MAKES BEEPING SOUNDS.

                                     BEN

                         OUT WHAT YOU ARE, MY LITTLE FRIEND.
                         AND WHERE YOU COME FROM.

                         I SAW PART OF THE MESSAGE HE WAS...

               LUKE IS CUT SHORT AS THE RECORDED IMAGE OF THE BEAUTIFUL
               YOUNG REBEL PRINCESS IS PROJECTED FROM ARTOO'S FACE.

                                     BEN
                         I SEEM TO HAVE FOUND IT.

               LUKE STOPS HIS WORK AS THE LOVELY GIRL'S IMAGE FLICKERS BEFORE
               HIS EYES.

                         MY FATHER IN THE CLONE WARS. NOW HE
                         BEGS YOU TO HELP HIM IN HIS STRUGGLE
                         AGAINST THE EMPIRE. I REGRET THAT I
                         AM UNABLE TO PRESENT MY FATHER'S
                         REQUEST TO YOU IN PERSON, BUT MY
                         SHIP HAS FALLEN UNDER ATTACK AND I'M
                         AFRAID MY MISSION TO BRING YOU TO
                         ALDERAAN HAS FAILED. I HAVE PLACED
                         INFORMATION VITAL TO THE SURVIVAL OF
                         THE REBELLION INTO THE MEMORY SYSTEMS
                         OF THIS R2 UNIT. MY FATHER WILL KNOW
                         HOW TO RETRIEVE IT. YOU MUST SEE
                         THIS DROID SAFELY DELIVERED TO HIM
                         ON ALDERAAN. THIS IS OUR MOST
                         DESPERATE HOUR. HELP ME, OBI-WAN
                         KENOBI, YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE.

               THERE IS A LITTLE STATIC AND THE TRANSMISSION IS CUT SHORT.
               OLD BEN LEANS BACK AND SCRATCHES HIS HEAD. HE SILENTLY PUFFS
               ON A TARNISHED CHROME WATER PIPE. LUKE HAS STARS IN HIS EYES.

                                     BEN
                         YOU MUST LEARN THE WAYS OF THE FORCE
                         IF YOU'RE TO COME WITH ME TO ALDERAAN.

                                     LUKE
                              (LAUGHING)
                         ALDERAAN? I'M NOT GOING TO ALDERAAN.
                         I'VE GOT TO GO HOME. IT'S LATE, I'M
                         IN FOR IT AS IT IS.

                                     BEN
                         I NEED YOUR HELP, LUKE. SHE NEEDS
                         YOUR HELP. I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR
                         THIS SORT OF THING.

                                     LUKE
                         I CAN'T GET INVOLVED! I'VE GOT WORK
                         TO DO! IT'S NOT THAT I LIKE THE
                         EMPIRE. I HATE IT! BUT THERE'S NOTHING
                         I CAN DO ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. IT'S
                         SUCH A LONG WAY FROM HERE.

                                     BEN
                         THAT'S YOUR UNCLE TALKING.

                         GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS?

                         LOOK, I CAN TAKE YOU AS FAR AS
                         ANCHORHEAD. YOU CAN GET A TRANSPORT
                         THERE TO MOS EISLEY OR WHEREVER YOU'RE
                         GOING.

                         OF COURSE.

               AN IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER HEADS TOWARD THE EVIL PLANET-LIKE
               BATTLE STATION: THE DEATH STAR!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

               EIGHT IMPERIAL SENATORS AND GENERALS SIT AROUND A BLACK
               CONFERENCE TABLE. IMPERIAL STORMTROOPERS STAND GUARD AROUND
               THE ROOM. COMMANDER TAGGE, A YOUNG, SLIMY-LOOKING GENERAL,
               IS SPEAKING.

                                     TAGGE
                         UNTIL THIS BATTLE STATION IS FULLY
                         OPERATIONAL WE ARE VULNERABLE. THE
                         REBEL ALLIANCE IS TOO WELL EQUIPPED.
                         THEY'RE MORE DANGEROUS THAN YOU
                         REALIZE.

               THE BITTER ADMIRAL MOTTI TWISTS NERVOUSLY IN HIS CHAIR.

                                     MOTTI
                         DANGEROUS TO YOUR STARFLEET,
                         COMMANDER, NOT TO THIS BATTLE STATION!

                                     TAGGE
                         THE REBELLION WILL CONTINUE TO GAIN
                         A SUPPORT IN THE IMPERIAL SENATE AS
                         LONG AS....

               SUDDENLY ALL HEADS TURN AS COMMANDER TAGGE'S SPEECH IS CUT
               SHORT AND THE GRAND MOFF TARKIN, GOVERNOR OF THE IMPERIAL
               OUTLAND REGIONS, ENTERS. HE IS FOLLOWED BY HIS POWERFUL ALLY,
               THE SITH LORD, DARTH VADER. ALL OF THE GENERALS STAND AND
               BOW BEFORE THE THIN, EVIL-LOOKING GOVERNOR AS HE TAKES HIS
               PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE. THE DARK LORD STANDS BEHIND
               HIM.

                                     TARKIN
                         THE IMPERIAL SENATE WILL NO LONGER
                         BE OF ANY CONCERN TO US. I'VE JUST
                         RECEIVED WORD THAT THE EMPEROR HAS
                         DISSOLVED THE COUNCIL PERMANENTLY.
                         THE LAST REMNANTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC
                         HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY.

                                     TAGGE
                         THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! HOW WILL THE
                         EMPEROR MAINTAIN CONTROL WITHOUT THE
                         BUREAUCRACY?

                                     TARKIN
                         THE REGIONAL GOVERNORS NOW HAVE DIRECT
                         CONTROL OVER TERRITORIES. FEAR WILL
                         KEEP THE LOCAL SYSTEMS IN LINE. FEAR
                         OF THIS BATTLE STATION.

                                     TAGGE
                         AND WHAT OF THE REBELLION? IF THE
                         REBELS HAVE OBTAINED A COMPLETE
                         TECHNICAL READOUT OF THIS STATION,
                         IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER UNLIKELY,
                         THAT THEY MIGHT FIND A WEAKNESS AND
                         EXPLOIT IT.

                                     VADER
                         THE PLANS YOU REFER TO WILL SOON BE
                         BACK IN OUR HANDS.

                                     MOTTI
                         ANY ATTACK MADE BY THE REBELS AGAINST
                         THIS STATION WOULD BE A USELESS
                         GESTURE, NO MATTER WHAT TECHNICAL
                         DATA THEY'VE OBTAINED. THIS STATION
                         IS NOW THE ULTIMATE POWER IN THE
                         UNIVERSE. I SUGGEST WE USE IT!

                                     VADER
                         DON'T BE TOO PROUD OF THIS
                         TECHNOLOGICAL TERROR YOU'VE
                         CONSTRUCTED. THE ABILITY TO DESTROY
                         A PLANET IS INSIGNIFICANT NEXT TO
                         THE POWER OF THE FORCE.

                                     MOTTI
                         DON'T TRY TO FRIGHTEN US WITH YOUR
                         SORCERER'S WAYS, LORD VADER. YOUR
                         SAD DEVOTION TO THAT ANCIENT RELIGION
                         HAS NOT HELPED YOU CONJURE UP THE
                         STOLEN DATA TAPES, OR GIVEN YOU
                         CLAIRVOYANCE ENOUGH TO FIND THE
                         REBEL'S HIDDEN FORT...

               SUDDENLY MOTTI CHOKES AND STARTS TO TURN BLUE UNDER VADER'S
               SPELL.

                                     VADER
                         I FIND YOUR LACK OF FAITH DISTURBING.

                                     TARKIN
                         ENOUGH OF THIS! VADER, RELEASE HIM!

                                     VADER
                         AS YOU WISH.

                                     TARKIN
                         THIS BICKERING IS POINTLESS. LORD
                         VADER WILL PROVIDE US WITH THE
                         LOCATION OF THE REBEL FORTRESS BY
                         THE TIME THIS STATION IS OPERATIONAL.
                         WE WILL THEN CRUSH THE REBELLION
                         WITH ONE SWIFT STROKE.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               THE SPEEDER STOPS BEFORE WHAT REMAINS OF THE HUGE JAWAS
               SANDCRAWLER. LUKE AND BEN WALK AMONG THE SMOLDERING RUBBLE
               AND SCATTERED BODIES.

                                     LUKE
                         IT LOOKS LIKE SANDPEOPLE DID THIS,
                         ALL RIGHT. LOOK, HERE ARE GAFFI
                         STICKS, BANTHA TRACKS. IT'S JUST...
                         I NEVER HEARD OF THEM HITTING ANYTHING
                         THIS BIG BEFORE.

               BEN IS CROUCHING IN THE SAND STUDYING THE TRACKS.

                                     BEN
                         THEY DIDN'T. BUT WE ARE MEANT TO
                         THINK THEY DID. THESE TRACKS ARE
                         SIDE BY SIDE. SANDPEOPLE ALWAYS RIDE
                         SINGLE FILE TO HIDE THERE NUMBERS.

                                     LUKE
                         THESE ARE THE SAME JAWAS THAT SOLD
                         US ARTOO AND THREEPIO.

                                     BEN
                         AND THESE BLAST POINTS, TOO ACCURATE
                         FOR SANDPEOPLE. ONLY IMPERIAL
                         STORMTROOPERS ARE SO PRECISE.

                                     LUKE
                         WHY WOULD IMPERIAL TROOPS WANT TO
                         SLAUGHTER JAWAS?

               LUKE LOOKS BACK AT THE SPEEDER WHERE ARTOO AND THREEPIO ARE
               INSPECTING THE DEAD JAWAS, AND PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

                                     LUKE
                         IF THEY TRACED THE ROBOTS HERE, THEY
                         MAY HAVE LEARNED WHO THEY SOLD THEM
                         TO. AND THAT WOULD LEAD THEM HOME!

               LUKE REACHES A SUDDEN HORRIBLE REALIZATION, THEN RACES FOR
               THE SPEEDER AND JUMPS IT.

                                     BEN
                         WAIT, LUKE! IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

               LUKE RACES OFF LEAVING BEN AND THE TWO ROBOTS ALONE WITH THE
               BURNING SANDCRAWLER.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               LUKE RACES ACROSS THE WASTELAND IN HIS BATTERED LANDSPEEDER.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               THE SPEEDER ROARS UP TO THE BURNING HOMESTEAD. LUKE JUMPS
               OUT AND RUNS TO THE SMOKING HOLES THAT WERE ONCE HIS HOME.
               DEBRIS IS SCATTERED EVERYWHERE AND IT LOOKS AS IF A GREAT
               BATTLE HAS TAKEN PLACE.

                                     LUKE
                         UNCLE OWEN! AUNT BERU! UNCLE OWEN!

               LUKE STUMBLES AROUND IN A DAZE LOOKING FOR HIS AUNT AND UNCLE.
               SUDDENLY HE COMES UPON THEIR SMOLDERING REMAINS. HE IS
               STUNNED, AND CANNOT SPEAK. HATE REPLACES FEAR AND A NEW
               RESOLVE COMES OVER HIM.

               EXT. SPACE

               IMPERIAL TIE FIGHTER RACES TOWARD THE DEATH STAR.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

               TWO STORMTROOPERS OPEN AN ELECTRONIC CELL DOOR AND ALLOW
               SEVERAL IMPERIAL GUARDS TO ENTER. PRINCESS LEIA'S FACE IS
               FILLED WITH DEFIANCE, WHICH SLOWLY GIVES WAY TO FEAR AS A
               GIANT BLACK TORTURE ROBOT ENTERS, FOLLOWED BY DARTH VADER.

                                     VADER
                         AND, NOW YOUR HIGHNESS, WE WILL
                         DISCUSS THE LOCATION OF YOUR HIDDEN
                         REBEL BASE.

               THE TORTURE ROBOT GIVES OFF A STEADY BEEPING SOUND AS IT
               APPROACHES PRINCESS LEIA AND EXTENDS ONE OF ITS MECHANICAL
               ARMS BEARING A LARGE HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. THE DOOR SLIDES SHUT
               AND THE LONG CELL BLOCK HALLWAY APPEARS PEACEFUL. THE MUFFLED
               SCREAMS OF THE REBEL PRINCESS ARE BARELY HEARD.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               THERE IS A LARGE BONFIRE OF JAWA BODIES BLAZING IN FRONT OF
               THE SANDCRAWLER AS BEN AND THE ROBOTS FINISH BURNING THE
               DEAD.  LUKE DRIVES UP IN THE SPEEDER AND BEN WALKS OVER TO
               HIM.

                                     BEN
                         THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD HAVE DONE,
                         LUKE, HAD YOU BEEN THERE. YOU'D HAVE
                         BEEN KILLED, TOO, AND THE DROIDS
                         WOULD BE IN THE HANDS OF THE EMPIRE.

                                     LUKE
                         I WANT TO COME WITH YOU TO ALDERAAN.
                         THERE'S NOTHING HERE FOR ME NOW. I
                         WANT TO LEARN THE WAYS OF THE FORCE
                         AND BECOME A JEDI LIKE MY FATHER.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               THE LANDSPEEDER WITH LUKE, ARTOO, THREEPIO, AND BEN IN IT
               ZOOMS ACROSS THE DESERT. THE SPEEDER STOPS ON A BLUFF
               OVERLOOKING THE SPACEPORT AT MOS EISLEY. IT IS A HAPHAZARD
               ARRAY OF LOW, GREY, CONCRETE STRUCTURES AND SEMI-DOMES. A
               HARSH GALE BLOWS ACROSS THE STARK CANYON FLOOR. LUKE ADJUSTS
               HIS GOGGLES AND WALKS TO THE EDGE OF THE CRAGGY BLUFF WHERE
               BEN IS STANDING.

                                     BEN
                         MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT. YOU WILL NEVER
                         FIND A MORE WRETCHED HIVE OF SCUM
                         AND VILLAINY. WE MUST BE CAUTIOUS.

               BEN LOOKS OVER AT LUKE, WHO GIVES THE OLD JEDI A DETERMINED
               SMILE.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               THE SPEEDER IS STOPPED ON A CROWDED STREET BY SEVERAL COMBAT-
               HARDEND STORMTROOPERS WHO LOOK OVER THE TWO ROBOTS. A TROOPER
               QUESTIONS LUKE.

                                     TROOPER
                         HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THESE DROIDS?

                                     LUKE
                         ABOUT THREE OR FOUR SEASONS.

                                     BEN
                         THEY'RE FOR SALE IF YOU WANT THEM.

                                     TROOPER
                         LET ME SEE YOUR IDENTIFICATION.

               LUKE BECOMES VERY NERVOUS AS HE FUMBLES TO FIND HIS ID WHILE
               BEN SPEAKS TO THE TROOPER IN A VERY CONTROLLED VOICE.

                                     BEN
                         YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE HIS
                         IDENTIFICATION.

                                     TROOPER
                         WE DON'T NEED TO SEE HIS
                         IDENTIFICATION.

                                     BEN
                         THESE ARE NOT THE DROIDS YOUR LOOKING
                         FOR.

                                     TROOPER
                         THESE ARE NOT THE DROIDS WE'RE LOOKING
                         FOR.

                                     BEN
                         HE CAN GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS.

                                     TROOPER
                         YOU CAN GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.

                                     BEN
                              (TO LUKE)
                         MOVE ALONG.

                                     TROOPER
                         MOVE ALONG. MOVE ALONG.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               THE SPEEDER PULLS UP IN FRONT OF A RUNDOWN BLOCKHOUSE CANTINA
               ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE SPACEPORT. VARIOUS STRANGE FORMS OF
               TRANSPORT, INCLUDING SEVERAL UNUSUAL BEASTS OF BURDEN, ARE
               PARKED OUTSIDE THE BAR. A JAWA RUNS UP AND BEGINS TO FONDLE
               THE SPEEDER.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I CAN'T ABIDE THESE JAWAS. DISGUSTING
                         CREATURES.

               AS LUKE GETS OUT OF THE SPEEDER HE TRIES TO SHOO THE JAWA
               AWAY.

                                     LUKE
                         GO ON, GO ON. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW
                         WE GOT BY THOSE TROOPERS. I THOUGHT
                         WE WERE DEAD.

                                     BEN
                         THE FORCE CAN HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE
                         ON THE WEAK-MINDED. YOU WILL FIND IT
                         A POWERFUL ALLY.

                                     LUKE
                         DO YOU REALLY THINK WE'RE GOING TO
                         FIND A PILOT HERE THAT'LL TAKE US TO
                         ALDERAAN?

                                     BEN
                         WELL, MOST OF THE BEST FREIGHTER
                         PILOTS CAN BE FOUND HERE. ONLY WATCH
                         YOUR STEP. THIS PLACE CAN BE A LITTLE
                         ROUGH.

                                     LUKE
                         I'M READY FOR ANYTHING.

                                     THREEPIO
                         COME ALONG, ARTOO.

               INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               THE YOUNG ADVENTURER AND HIS TWO MECHANICAL SERVANTS FOLLOW
               BEN KENOBI INTO THE SMOKE-FILLED CANTINA. THE MURKY, MOLDY
               DEN IS FILLED WITH A STARTLING ARRAY OF WEIRD AND EXOTIC
               ALIEN CREATURES AND MONSTERS AT THE LONG METALLIC BAR. AT
               FIRST THE SIGHT IS HORRIFYING. ONE-EYED, THOUSAND-EYED, SLIMY,
               FURRY, SCALY, TENTACLED, AND CLAWED CREATURES HUDDLE OVER
               DRINKS. BEN MOVES TO AN EMPTY SPOT AT THE BAR NEAR A GROUP
               OF REPULSIVE BUT HUMAN SCUM. A HUGE, ROUGH-LOOKING BARTENDER
               STOPS LUKE AND THE ROBOTS.

                                     BARTENDER
                         WE DON'T SERVE THEIR KIND HERE!

               LUKE STILL RECOVERING FROM THE SHOCK OF SEEING SO MANY
               OUTLANDISH CREATURES, DOESN'T QUITE CATCH THE BARTENDER'S
               DRIFT.

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT?

                                     BARTENDER
                         YOUR DROIDS. THEY'LL HAVE TO WAIT
                         OUTSIDE. WE DON'T WANT THEM HERE.

               LUKE LOOKS AT OLD BEN, WHO IS BUSY TALKING TO ONE OF THE
               GALACTIC PIRATES. HE NOTICES SEVERAL OF THE GRUESOME CREATURES
               ALONG THE BAR ARE GIVING HIM A VERY UNFRIENDLY GLARE.

               LUKE PATS THREEPIO ON THE SHOULDER.

                                     LUKE
                         LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU WAIT OUT BY
                         THE SPEEDER. WE DON'T WANT ANY
                         TROUBLE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I HEARTILY AGREE WITH YOU SIR.

               THREEPIO AND HIS STUBBY PARTNER GO OUTSIDE AND MOST OF THE
               CREATURES AT THE BAR GO BACK TO THEIR DRINKS.

               BEN IS STANDING NEXT TO CHEWBACCA, AN EIGHT-FOOT-TALL SAVAGE-
               LOOKING CREATURE RESEMBLING A HUGE GREY BUSHBABY MONKEY WITH
               FIERCE BABOON-LIKE FANGS. HIS LARGE BLUE EYES DOMINATE A FUR-
               COVERED FACE AND SOFTEN HIS OTHERWISE AWESOME APPEARANCE.
               OVER HIS MATTED, FURRY BODY HE WEARS TWO CHROME BANDOLIERS,
               AND LITTLE ELSE. HE IS A TWO-HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD WOOKIEE AND A
               SIGHT TO BEHOLD.

               BEN SPEAKS TO THE WOOKIEE, POINTING TO LUKE SEVERAL TIMES
               DURING HIS CONVERSATION AND THE HUGE CREATURE SUDDENLY LETS
               OUT A HORRIFYING LAUGH. LUKE IS MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT
               DISCONCERTED AND PRETENDS NOT TO HEAR THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN
               BEN AND THE GIANT WOOKIEE.

               LUKE IS TERRIFIED BUT TRIES NOT TO SHOW IT. HE QUIETLY SIPS
               HIS DRINK, LOOKING OVER THE CROWD FOR A MORE SYMPATHETIC EAR
               OR WHATEVER.

               A LARGE, MULTIPLE-EYED CREATURE GIVES LUKE A ROUGH SHOVE.

                         NEGOLA DEWAGHI WOOLDUGGER?!?

               THE HIDEOUS FREAK IS OBVIOUSLY DRUNK. LUKE TRIES TO IGNORE
               THE CREATURE AND TURNS BACK ON HIS DRINK. A SHORT, GRUBBY
               HUMAN AND AN EVEN SMALLER RODENT-LIKE BEAST JOIN THE
               BELLIGERENT MONSTROSITY.

                                     HUMAN
                         HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

                                     LUKE
                         I'M SORRY.

                                     HUMAN
                         I DON'T LIKE YOU EITHER.

               THE BIG CREATURE IS GETTING AGITATED AND YELLS OUT SOME
               UNINTELLIGIBLE GIBBERISH AT THE NOW RATHER NERVOUS, YOUNG
               ADVENTURER.

                                     HUMAN
                         DON'T INSULT US. YOU JUST WATCH
                         YOURSELF. WE'RE WANTED MEN. I HAVE
                         THE DEATH SENTENCE IN TWELVE SYSTEMS.

                                     LUKE
                         I'LL BE CAREFUL THAN.

                                     HUMAN
                         YOU'LL BE DEAD.

               THE RODENT LETS OUT A LOUD GRUNT AND EVERYTHING AT THE BAR
               MOVES AWAY. LUKE TRIES TO REMAIN COOL BUT IT ISN'T EASY. HIS
               THREE ADVERSARIES READY THEIR WEAPONS. OLD BEN MOVES IN BEHIND
               LUKE.

                         THIS LITTLE ONE ISN'T WORTH THE

                         SOMETHING...

               A POWERFUL BLOW FROM THE UNPLEASANT CREATURE SENDS THE YOUNG
               WOULD-BE JEDI SAILING ACROSS THE ROOM, CRASHING THROUGH TABLES
               AND BREAKING A LARGE JUG FILLED WITH A FOUL-LOOKING LIQUID.
               WITH A BLOOD CURDLING SHRIEK, THE MONSTER DRAWS A WICKED
               CHROME LASER PISTOL FROM HIS BELT AND LEVELS IT AT OLD BEN.

               WITH ASTOUNDING AGILITY OLD BEN'S LASER SWORD SPARKS TO LIFE
               AND IN A FLASH AN ARM LIES ON THE FLOOR. THE RODENT IS CUT
               IN TWO AND THE GIANT MULTIPLE-EYED CREATURE LIES DOUBLED,
               CUT FROM CHIN TO GROIN. BEN CAREFULLY AND PRECISELY TURNS
               OFF HIS LASER SWORD AND REPLACES IT ON HIS UTILITY BELT.
               LUKE, SHAKING AND TOTALLY AMAZED AT THE OLD MAN'S ABILITIES,
               ATTEMPTS TO STAND. THE ENTIRE FIGHT HAS LASTED ONLY A MATTER
               OF SECONDS. THE CANTINA GOES BACK TO NORMAL, ALTHOUGH BEN IS
               GIVEN A RESPECTABLE AMOUNT OF ROOM AT THE BAR. LUKE, RUBBING
               HIS BRUISED HEAD, APPROACHES THE OLD MAN WITH NEW AWE. BEN
               POINTS THE THE WOOKIEE.

               FOUR HEAVILY-ARMED STORMTROOPERS MOVE MENACINGLY ALONG A
               NARROW SLUM ALLEYWAY CROWED WITH DARKLY CLAD CREATURES HAWKING
               EXOTIC GOODS IN THE DINGY LITTLE STALLS. MEN, MONSTERS, AND
               ROBOTS CROUCH IN THE WASTE-FILLED DOORWAYS, WHISPERING AND
               HIDING FROM THE HOT WINDS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         LOCK THE DOOR, ARTOO.

               ONE OF THE TROOPERS CHECKS A TIGHTLY LOCKED DOOR AND MOVES
               ON DOWN THE ALLEYWAY. THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN A CRACK AND
               THREEPIO PEEKS OUT. ARTOO IS BARELY VISIBLE IN THE BACKGROUND.

                                     TROOPER
                         ALL RIGHT, CHECK THAT SIDE OF THE
                         STREET. IT'S SECURE. MOVE ON TO THE
                         NEXT DOOR.

               THE DOOR OPENS, THREEPIO MOVES INTO THE DOORWAY.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE GONE WITH
                         MASTER LUKE THAN STAY HERE WITH YOU.
                         I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE TROUBLE IS
                         ABOUT, BUT I'M SURE IT MUST BE YOUR
                         FAULT.

               ARTOO MAKES BEEPING SOUNDS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET - ALLEYWAY - USED
               SPEEDER LOT

               BEN AND LUKE ARE STANDING IN A SLEAZY USED SPEEDER LOT,
               TALKING WITH A TALL, GROTESQUE, INSECT-LIKE USED SPEEDER
               DEALER. STRANGE EXOTIC BODIES AND SPINDLY-LEGGED BEASTS PASS
               BY AS THE INSECT CONCLUDES THE SALE BY GIVING LUKE SOME COINS.

                                     LUKE
                         HE SAYS IT'S THE BEST HE CAN DO.
                         SINCE THE XP-38 CAME OUT, THEY'RE
                         JUST NOT IN DEMAND.

                                     BEN
                         IT WILL BE ENOUGH.

               BEN AND LUKE LEAVE THE SPEEDER LOT AND WALK DOWN THE DUSTY
               ALLEYWAY PAST A SMALL ROBOT HERDING A BUNCH OF ANTEATER-LIKE
               CREATURES. LUKE TURNS AND GIVES ONE LAST FORLORN LOOK AT HIS
               FAITHFUL SPEEDER AS HE ROUNDS A CORNER. A DARKLY CLAD CREATURE
               MOVES OUT OF THE SHADOWS AS THEY PASS AND WATCHES THEM AS
               THEY DISAPPEAR DOWN ANOTHER ALLEY.

                                     BEN
                         IF THE SHIP'S AS FAST AS HE'S
                         BOASTING, WE OUGHT TO DO WELL.

               INT. DOCKING BAY 94 - DAY

               JABBA THE HUT AND A HALF-DOZEN GRISLY ALIEN PIRATES AND PURPLE
               CREATURES STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOCKING BAY. JABBA IS
               THE GROSSEST OF THE SLAVERING HULKS AND HIS SCARRED FACE IS
               A GRIM TESTIMONIAL TO HIS PROWESS AS A VICIOUS KILLER. HE IS
               A FAT, SLUG-LIKE CREATURE WITH EYES ON EXTENDED FEELERS AND
               A HUGE UGLY MOUTH.

                                     JABBA
                         COME ON OUT, SOLO!

               A VOICE FROM DIRECTLY BEHIND THE PIRATES STARTLES THEM AND
               THEY TURN AROUND TO SEE HAN SOLO AND THE GIANT WOOKIEE,
               CHEWBACCA, STANDING BEHIND THEM WITH NO WEAPONS IN SIGHT.

                                     HAN
                         I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU, JABBA.

                                     JABBA
                         I EXPECTED YOU WOULD BE.

                                     HAN
                         I'M NOT THE TYPE TO RUN.

                                     JABBA
                              (FATHERLY-SMOOTH)
                         HAN, MY BOY, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
                         YOU DISAPPOINT ME... WHY HAVEN'T YOU
                         PAID ME? AND WHY DID YOU HAVE TO FRY
                         POOR GREEDO LIKE THAT... AFTER ALL
                         WE'VE BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER.

                                     HAN
                         YOU SENT GREEDO TO BLAST ME.

                                     JABBA
                              (MOCK SURPRISE)
                         HAN, WHY YOU'RE THE BEST SMUGGLER IN
                         THE BUSINESS. YOU'RE TOO VALUABLE TO
                         FRY. HE WAS ONLY RELAYING MY CONCERN
                         AT YOUR DELAYS. HE WASN'T GOING TO
                         BLAST YOU.

                                     HAN
                         I THINK HE THOUGHT HE WAS. NEXT TIME
                         DON'T SEND ONE OF THOSE TWERPS. IF
                         YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME,
                         COME SEE ME YOURSELF.

                                     JABBA
                         HAN, HAN! IF ONLY YOU HADN'T HAD TO
                         DUMP THAT SHIPMENT OF SPICE... YOU
                         UNDERSTAND I JUST CAN'T MAKE AN
                         EXCEPTION. WHERE WOULD I BE IF EVERY
                         PILOT WHO SMUGGLED FOR ME DUMPED
                         THEIR SHIPMENT AT THE FIRST SIGN OF
                         AN IMPERIAL STARSHIP? IT'S NOT GOOD
                         BUSINESS.

                                     HAN
                         YOU KNOW, EVEN I GET BOARDED
                         SOMETIMES, JABBA. I HAD NO CHOICE,
                         BUT I'VE GOT A CHARTER NOW AND I CAN
                         PAY YOU BACK, PLUS A LITTLE EXTRA. I
                         JUST NEED SOME MORE TIME.

                                     JABBA
                              (TO HIS MEN)
                         PUT YOUR BLASTERS AWAY. HAN, MY BOY,
                         I'M ONLY DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE
                         THE BEST AND I NEED YOU. SO, FOR AN
                         EXTRA, SAY TWENTY PERCENT I'LL GIVE
                         YOU A LITTLE MORE TIME... BUT THIS
                         IS IT. IF YOU DISAPPOINT ME AGAIN,
                         I'LL PUT A PRICE ON YOUR HEAD SO
                         LARGE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GO NEAR A
                         CIVILIZED SYSTEM FOR THE REST OF
                         YOUR SHORT LIFE.

                                     HAN
                         JABBA, I'LL PAY YOU BECAUSE IT'S MY
                         PLEASURE.

               EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY

               CHEWBACCA WAITS RESTLESSLY AT THE ENTRANCE TO DOCKING BAY
               94.  BEN, LUKE, AND THE ROBOTS MAKE THEIR WAY UP THE STREET.
               CHEWBACCA JABBERS EXCITEDLY AND SIGNALS FOR THEM TO HURRY.
               THE DARKLY CLAD CREATURE HAS FOLLOWED THEM FROM THE SPEEDER
               LOT.  HE STOPS IN A NEARBY DOORWAY AND SPEAKS INTO A SMALL
               TRANSMITTER.

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

               CHEWBACCA LEADS THE GROUP INTO A GIANT DIRT PIT THAT IS
               DOCKING BAY 94. RESTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HUGE HOLE IS A
               LARGE, ROUND, BEAT-UP, PIECED-TOGETHER HUNK OF JUNK THAT
               COULD ONLY LOOSELY BE CALLED A STARSHIP.

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK.

               THE TALL FIGURE OF HAN SOLO COMES DOWN THE BOARDING RAMP.

                                     HAN
                         SHE'LL MAKE POINT FIVE BEYOND THE
                         SPEED OF LIGHT. SHE MAY NOT LOOK
                         LIKE MUCH, BUT SHE'S GOT IT WHERE IT
                         COUNTS, KID. I'VE ADDED SOME SPECIAL
                         MODIFICATIONS MYSELF.

               LUKE SCRATCHES HIS HEAD. IT'S OBVIOUS HE ISN'T SURE ABOUT
               ALL THIS. CHEWBACCA RUSHES UP THE RAMP AND URGES THE OTHERS
               TO FOLLOW.

                                     HAN
                         WE'RE A LITTLE RUSHED, SO IF YOU'LL
                         HURRY ABOARD WE'LL GET OUT OF HERE.

               THE GROUP RUSHES UP THE GANG PLANK, PASSING A GRINNING HAN
               SOLO.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

               CHEWBACCA SETTLES INTO THE PILOT'S CHAIR AND STARTS THE MIGHTY
               ENGINES OF THE STARSHIP.

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

               LUKE, BEN, THREEPIO, AND ARTOO MOVE TOWARD THE MILLENNIUM
               FALCON PASSING SOLO.

                                     THREEPIO
                         HELLO, SIR.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               EIGHT IMPERIAL STORMTROOPERS RUSH UP TO THE DARKLY CLAD
               CREATURE.

                                     TROOPER
                         WHICH WAY?

               THE DARKLY CLAD CREATURE POINTS TO THE DOOR OF THE DOCKING
               BAY.

                                     TROOPER
                         ALL RIGHT, MEN. LOAD YOUR WEAPONS!

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94]

               THE TROOPS HOLD THEIR GUNS AT THE READY AND CHARGE DOWN THE
               DOCKING BAY ENTRANCE.

                                     TROOPER
                         STOP THAT SHIP!

               HAN SOLO LOOKS UP AND SEES THE IMPERIAL STORMTROOPERS RUSHING
               INTO THE DOCKING BAY. SEVERAL OF THE TROOPERS FIRE AT HAN AS
               HE DUCKS INTO THE SPACESHIP.

                                     TROOPER
                         BLAST 'EM!

               HAN DRAWS HIS LASER PISTOL AND POPS OFF A COUPLE OF SHOTS
               WHICH FORCE THE STORMTROOPERS TO DIVE FOR SAFETY. THE
               PIRATESHIP ENGINES WHINE AS HAN HITS THE RELEASE BUTTON THAT
               SLAMS THE OVERHEAD ENTRY SHUT.

                         CHEWIE, GET US OUT OF HERE!

               THE GROUP STRAPS IN FOR TAKE OFF.

                                     THREEPIO
                         OH, MY. I'D FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I
                         HATE SPACE TRAVEL.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS

               THE HALF-DOZEN STORMTROOPERS AT A CHECK POINT HEAR THE GENERAL
               ALARM AND LOOK TO THE SKY AS THE HUGE STARSHIP RISES ABOVE
               THE DINGY SLUM DWELLINGS AND QUICKLY DISAPPEARS INTO THE
               MORNING SKY.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               HAN CLIMBS INTO THE PILOT'S CHAIR NEXT TO CHEWBACCA, WHO
               CHATTERS AWAY AS HE POINTS TO SOMETHING ON THE RADAR SCOPE.

               LITTLE ARTOO APPEARS MOMENTARILY AT THE COCKPIT DOORWAY,
               MAKES A FEW BEEPING REMARKS, THEN SCURRIES AWAY.

                         IT LOOKS LIKE AN IMPERIAL CRUISER.
                         OUR PASSENGERS MUST BE HOTTER THAN I
                         THOUGHT. TRY AND HOLD THEM OFF. ANGLE

                         LIKE DUSTING CROPS, BOY! WITHOUT
                         PRECISE CALCULATIONS WE COULD FLY
                         RIGHT THROUGH A STAR OR BOUNCE TOO
                         CLOSE TO A SUPERNOVA AND THAT'D END
                         YOUR TRIP REAL QUICK, WOULDN'T IT?

               THE SHIP IS NOW CONSTANTLY BATTERED WITH LASERFIRE AS A RED
               WARNING LIGHT BEGINS TO FLASH.

                         WHAT'S THAT FLASHING?

                         WE'RE LOSING OUR DEFLECTOR SHIELD.

                         MAKE THE JUMP TO LIGHT SPEED.

               THE GALAXY BRIGHTENS AND THEY MOVE FASTER, ALMOST AS IF
               CRASHING A BARRIER. STARS BECOME STREAKS AS THE PIRATESHIP
               MAKES THE JUMP TO HYPERSPACE.

                         WE'VE ENTERED THE ALDERAAN SYSTEM.

               VADER AND TWO STORMTROOPERS ENTER WITH PRINCESS LEIA. HER
               HANDS ARE BOUND.

                         GOVERNOR TARKIN, I SHOULD HAVE
                         EXPECTED TO FIND YOU HOLDING VADER'S
                         LEASH. I RECOGNIZED YOUR FOUL STENCH
                         WHEN I WAS BROUGHT ON BOARD.

                         I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE MY GUEST AT A
                         CEREMONY THAT WILL MAKE THIS BATTLE

                         NOT AFTER WE DEMONSTRATE THE POWER
                         OF THIS STATION. IN A WAY, YOU HAVE
                         DETERMINED THE CHOICE OF THE PLANET

                         I GROW TIRED OF ASKING THIS. SO IT'LL
                         BE THE LAST TIME. WHERE IS THE REBEL
                         BASE?

               A BUTTON IS PRESSED WHICH SWITCHES ON A PANEL OF LIGHTS. A
               HOODED IMPERIAL SOLDIER REACHES OVERHEAD AND PULLS A LEVER.
               ANOTHER LEVER IS PULLED. VADER REACHES FOR STILL ANOTHER
               LEVER AND A BANK OF LIGHTS ON A PANEL AND WALL LIGHT UP. A
               HUGE BEAM OF LIGHT EMANATES FROM WITHIN A CONE-SHAPED AREA
               AND CONVERGES INTO A SINGLE LASER BEAM OUT TOWARD ALDERAAN.

               BEN WATCHES LUKE PRACTICE THE LIGHTSABER WITH A SMALL "SEEKER"
               ROBOT. BEN SUDDENLY TURNS AWAY AND SITS DOWN. HE FALTERS,
               SEEMS ALMOST FAINT.

                                     LUKE
                         ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WHAT'S WRONG?

                         I FELT A GREAT DISTURBANCE IN THE
                         FORCE... AS IF MILLIONS OF VOICES
                         SUDDENLY CRIED OUT IN TERROR AND
                         WERE SUDDENLY SILENCED. I FEAR
                         SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.

               BEN RUBS HIS FOREHEAD. HE SEEMS TO DRIFT INTO A TRANCE. THEN
               HE FIXES HIS GAZE ON LUKE.

                         WELL, YOU CAN FORGET YOUR TROUBLES
                         WITH THOSE IMPERIAL SLUGS. I TOLD
                         YOU I'D OUTRUN 'EM.

               LUKE IS ONCE AGAIN PRACTICING WITH THE LIGHTSABER.

                         DON'T EVERYONE THANK ME AT ONCE.

               THREEPIO WATCHES CHEWBACCA AND ARTOO WHO ARE ENGROSSED IN A
               GAME IN WHICH THREE-DIMENSIONAL HOLOGRAPHIC FIGURES MOVE
               ALONG A CHESS-TYPE BOARD.

                         ABOUT OH-TWO-HUNDRED HOURS.

               CHEWBACCA AND THE TWO ROBOTS SIT AROUND THE LIGHTED TABLE
               COVERED WITH SMALL HOLOGRAPHIC MONSTERS. EACH SIDE OF THE
               TABLE HAS A SMALL COMPUTER MONITOR EMBEDDED IN IT. CHEWBACCA
               SEEMS VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF AS HE RESTS HIS LANKY FUR-
               COVERED ARMS OVER HIS HEAD.

                         NOW BE CAREFUL, ARTOO.

               ARTOO IMMEDIATELY REACHES UP AND TAPS THE COMPUTER WITH HIS
               STUBBY CLAW HAND, CAUSING ONE OF THE HOLOGRAPHIC CREATURES
               TO WALK TO THE NEW SQUARE. A SUDDEN FROWN CROSSES CHEWBACCA'S
               FACE AND HE BEGINS YELLING GIBBERISH AT THE TINY ROBOT.
               THREEPIO INTERCEDES ON BEHALF OF HIS SMALL COMPANION AND
               BEGINS TO ARGUE WITH THE HUGE WOOKIEE.

                         HE MADE A FAIR MOVE. SCREAMING ABOUT
                         IT WON'T HELP YOU.

                         LET HIM HAVE IT. IT'S NOT WISE TO
                         UPSET A WOOKIEE.

                         PEOPLE'S ARMS OUT OF THEIR SOCKET
                         WHEN THEY LOSE. WOOKIEES ARE KNOWN
                         TO DO THAT.

                         I SEE YOUR POINT, SIR. I SUGGEST A
                         NEW STRATEGY, ARTOO. LET THE WOOKIEE
                         WIN.

               LUKE STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SMALL HOLD AREA; HE SEEMS
               FROZEN IN PLACE. A HUMMING LIGHTSABER IS HELD HIGH OVER HIS
               HEAD. BEN WATCHES HIM FROM THE CORNER, STUDYING HIS MOVEMENTS.
               HAN WATCHES WITH A BIT OF SMUGNESS.

                         REMEMBER, A JEDI CAN FEEL THE FORCE
                         FLOWING THROUGH HIM.

                         COMMANDS.

               SUSPENDED AT EYE LEVEL, ABOUT TEN FEET IN FRONT OF LUKE, A
               "SEEKER", A CHROME BASEBALL-LIKE ROBOT COVERED WITH ANTENNAE,
               HOVERS SLOWLY IN A WIDE ARC. THE BALL FLOATS TO ONE SIDE OF
               THE YOUTH THEN THE OTHER. SUDDENLY IT MAKES A LIGHTNING-SWIFT
               LUNGE AND STOPS WITHIN A FEW FEET OF LUKE'S FACE. LUKE DOESN'T
               MOVE AND THE BALL BACKS OFF. IT SLOWLY MOVES BEHIND THE BOY,
               THEN MAKES ANOTHER QUICK LUNGE, THIS TIME EMITTING A BLOOD
               RED LASER BEAM AS IT ATTACKS. IT HITS LUKE IN THE LEG CAUSING
               HIM TO TUMBLE OVER. HAN LETS LOOSE WITH A BURST OF LAUGHTER.

                         A LOT OF STRANGE STUFF, BUT I'VE
                         NEVER SEEN ANYTHING TO MAKE ME BELIEVE
                         THERE'S ONE ALL-POWERFUL FORCE

                         I SUGGEST YOU TRY IT AGAIN, LUKE.

               BEN PLACES A LARGE HELMET ON LUKE'S HEAD WHICH COVERS HIS
               EYES.

                                     BEN
                         THIS TIME, LET GO YOUR CONSCIOUS
                         SELF AND ACT ON INSTINCT.

                         WITH THE BLAST SHIELD DOWN, I CAN'T
                         EVEN SEE. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIGHT?

                                     BEN
                         YOUR EYES CAN DECEIVE YOU. DON'T
                         TRUST THEM.

               HAN SKEPTICALLY SHAKES HIS HEAD AS BEN THROWS THE SEEKER
               INTO THE AIR. THE BALL SHOOTS STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR, THEN
               DROPS LIKE A ROCK. LUKE SWINGS THE LIGHTSABER AROUND BLINDLY
               MISSING THE SEEKER, WHICH FIRES OFF A LASERBOLT WHICH HITS
               LUKE SQUARE ON THE SEAT OF THE PANTS. HE LETS OUT A PAINFUL
               YELL AND ATTEMPTS TO HIT THE SEEKER.

                                     BEN
                         STRETCH OUT WITH YOUR FEELINGS.

               LUKE STANDS IN ONE PLACE, SEEMINGLY FROZEN. THE SEEKER MAKES
               A DIVE AT LUKE AND, INCREDIBLY, HE MANAGED TO DEFLECT THE
               BOLT. THE BALL CEASES FIRE AND MOVES BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL
               POSITION.

                                     BEN

                         YES, SIR.

                                     VADER
                         I SENSE SOMETHING... A PRESENCE I
                         HAVEN'T FELT SINCE...

               VADER TURNS QUICKLY AND EXITS THE HANGAR.

                                     OFFICER
                         GET ME A SCANNING CREW IN HERE ON
                         THE DOUBLE. I WANT EVERY PART OF
                         THIS SHIP CHECKED!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY

               A TROOPER RUNS THROUGH THE HALLWAY HEADING FOR THE EXIT. IN
               A FEW MOMENTS ALL IS QUIET. THE MUFFLED SOUNDS OF A DISTANT
               OFFICER GIVING ORDERS FINALLY FADE. TWO FLOOR PANELS SUDDENLY
               POP UP REVEALING HAN SOLO AND LUKE. BEN KENOBI STICKS HIS
               HEAD OUT OF A THIRD LOCKER.

                                     LUKE
                         BOY, IT'S LUCKY YOU HAD THESE
                         COMPARTMENTS.

                                     HAN
                         I USE THEM FOR SMUGGLING. I NEVER
                         THOUGHT I'D BE SMUGGLING MYSELF IN
                         THEM. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. EVEN IF I
                         COULD TAKE OFF, I'D NEVER GET PAST
                         THE TRACTOR BEAM.

                                     BEN
                         LEAVE THAT TO ME!

                                     HAN
                         DAMN FOOL. I KNEW THAT YOU WERE GOING
                         TO SAY THAT!

                                     BEN
                         WHO'S THE MORE FOOLISH... THE FOOL
                         OR THE FOOL WHO FOLLOWS HIM?

               HAN SHAKES HIS HEAD, MUTTERING TO HIMSELF. CHEWBACCA AGREES.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               THE CREWMEN CARRY A HEAVY BOX ON BOARD THE SHIP, PAST THE
               TWO STORMTROOPERS GUARDING EITHER SIDE OF THE RAMP.

                                     TROOPER
                         THE SHIP'S ALL YOURS. IF THE SCANNERS
                         PICK UP ANYTHING, REPORT IT
                         IMMEDIATELY. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

               THE CREWMEN ENTER THE PIRATESHIP AND A LOUD CRASHING SOUND
               IS FOLLOWED BY A VOICE CALLING TO THE GUARD BELOW.

                                     HAN'S VOICE
                         HEY DOWN THERE, COULD YOU GIVE US A
                         HAND WITH THIS?

               THE STORMTROOPERS ENTER THE SHIP AND A QUICK ROUND OF GUNFIRE
               IS HEARD.

               INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE

               IN A VERY SMALL COMMAND OFFICE NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE
               PIRATESHIP, A GANTRY OFFICER LOOKS OUT HIS WINDOW AND NOTICES
               THE GUARDS ARE MISSING. HE SPEAKS INTO THE COMLINK.

                                     GANTRY OFFICER
                         TX-FOUR-ONE-TWO. WHY AREN'T YOU AT
                         YOUR POST? TX-FOUR-ONE-TWO, DO YOU
                         COPY?

               A STORMTROOPER COMES DOWN THE RAMP OF THE PIRATESHIP AND
               WAVES TO THE GANTRY OFFICER, POINTING TO HIS EAR INDICATING
               HIS COMLINK IS NOT WORKING. THE GANTRY OFFICER SHAKES HIS
               HEAD IN DISGUST AND HEADS FOR THE DOOR, GIVING HIS AIDE AN
               ANNOYED LOOK.

                                     GANTRY OFFICER
                         TAKE OVER. WE'VE GOT A BAD
                         TRANSMITTER. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

               AS THE OFFICER APPROACHES THE DOOR, IT SLIDES OPEN REVEALING
               THE TOWERING CHEWBACCA. THE GANTRY OFFICER, IN A MOMENTARY
               STATE OF SHOCK, STUMBLES BACKWARD. WITH A BONE- CHILLING
               HOWL, THE GIANT WOOKIEE FLATTENS THE OFFICER WITH ONE BLOW.
               THE AIDE IMMEDIATELY REACHES FOR HIS PISTOL, BUT IS BLASTED
               BY HAN, DRESSED AS AN IMPERIAL STORMTROOPER. BEN AND THE
               ROBOTS ENTER THE ROOM QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY LUKE, ALSO DRESSED
               AS A STORMTROOPER. LUKE QUICKLY REMOVES HIS HELMET.

                                     LUKE
                         YOU KNOW, BETWEEN HIS HOWLING AND
                         YOUR BLASTING EVERYTHING IN SIGHT,
                         IT'S A WONDER THE WHOLE STATION
                         DOESN'T KNOW WE'RE HERE.

                                     HAN
                         BRING THEM ON! I PREFER A STRAIGHT
                         FIGHT TO ALL THIS SNEAKING AROUND.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WE FOUND THE COMPUTER OUTLET, SIR.

               BEN FEEDS SOME INFORMATION INTO THE COMPUTER AND A MAP OF
               THE CITY APPEARS ON THE MONITOR. HE BEGINS TO INSPECT IT
               CAREFULLY. THREEPIO AND ARTOO LOOK OVER THE CONTROL PANEL.
               ARTOO FINDS SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIM WHISTLE WILDLY.

                                     BEN
                         PLUG IN. HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
                         INTERPRET THE ENTIRE IMPERIAL COMPUTER
                         NETWORK.

               ARTOO PUNCHES HIS CLAW ARM INTO THE COMPUTER SOCKET AND THE
               VAST IMPERIAL BRAIN NETWORK COMES TO LIFE, FEEDING INFORMATION
               TO THE LITTLE ROBOT. AFTER A FEW MOMENTS, HE BEEPS SOMETHING.

                                     THREEPIO
                         HE SAYS HE'S FOUND THE MAIN COMPUTER
                         TO POWER THE TRACTOR BEAM THAT'S
                         HOLDING THE SHIP HERE. HE'LL TRY TO
                         MAKE THE PRECISE LOCATION APPEAR ON
                         THE MONITOR.

               THE COMPUTER MONITOR FLASHES READOUTS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         THE TRACTOR BEAM IS COUPLED TO THE
                         MAIN REACTOR IN SEVEN LOCATIONS. A
                         POWER LOSS AT ONE OF THE TERMINALS
                         WILL ALLOW THE SHIP TO LEAVE.

               BEN STUDIES THE DATA ON THE MONITOR READOUT.

                                     BEN
                         I DON'T THINK YOU BOYS CAN HELP. I
                         MUST GO ALONE.

                                     HAN
                         WHATEVER YOU SAY. I'VE DONE MORE
                         THAT I BARGAINED FOR ON THIS TRIP
                         ALREADY.

                                     LUKE
                         I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

                                     BEN
                         BE PATIENT, LUKE. STAY AND WATCH
                         OVER THE DROIDS.

                                     LUKE
                         BUT HE CAN...

                                     BEN
                         THEY MUST BE DELIVERED SAFELY OR
                         OTHER STAR SYSTEMS WILL SUFFER THE
                         SAME FATE AS ALDERAAN. YOUR DESTINY
                         LIES ALONG A DIFFERENT PATH THAN
                         MINE. THE FORCE WILL BE WITH YOU...
                         ALWAYS!

               BEN ADJUSTS THE LIGHTSABER ON HIS BELT AND SILENTLY STEPS
               OUT OF THE COMMAND OFFICE, THEN DISAPPEARS DOWN A LONG GREY
               HALLWAY. CHEWBACCA BARKS A COMMENT AND HAN SHAKES HIS HEAD
               IN AGREEMENT.

                                     HAN
                         BOY YOU SAID IT, CHEWIE.

               HAN LOOKS AT LUKE.

                                     HAN

                         TROUBLE.

                         I DIDN'T HEAR YOU GIVE ANY IDEAS...

                                     HAN
                         WELL, ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER THAN
                         JUST HANGING AROUND WAITING FOR HIM
                         TO PICK US UP...

                         WHO DO YOU THINK...

               SUDDENLY ARTOO BEGINS TO WHISTLE AND BEEP A BLUE STREAK.
               LUKE GOES OVER TO HIM.

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT IS IT?

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'M AFRAID I'M NOT QUITE SURE, SIR.
                         HE SAYS "I FOUND HER", AND KEEPS
                         REPEATING, "SHE'S HERE."

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, WHO... WHO HAS HE FOUND?

               ARTOO WHISTLES A FRANTIC REPLY.

                         OH, NO! WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

                                     HAN

                         YOU.

               CHEWIE LETS OUT A HIDEOUS GROWL.

                                     LUKE
                         OKAY. HAN, YOU PUT THESE ON.

               LUKE SHEEPISHLY HANDS THE BINDERS TO HAN.

                                     HAN
                         DON'T WORRY, CHEWIE. I THINK I KNOW
                         WHAT HE HAS IN MIND.

               THE WOOKIEE HAS A WORRIED AND FRIGHTENED LOOK ON HIS FACE AS
               HAN BINDS HIM WITH THE ELECTRONIC CUFFS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         MASTER LUKE, SIR! PARDON ME FOR
                         ASKING... BUT, AH... WHAT SHOULD
                         ARTOO AND I DO IF WE'RE DISCOVERED
                         HERE?

                                     LUKE
                         LOCK THE DOOR!

                                     HAN
                         AND HOPE THEY DON'T HAVE BLASTERS.

                                     THREEPIO
                         THAT ISN'T VERY REASSURING.

               LUKE AND HAN PUT ON THEIR ARMORED STORMTROOPER HELMETS AND
               START OFF INTO THE GIANT IMPERIAL DEATH STAR.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE

               HAN AND LUKE TRY TO LOOK INCONSPICUOUS IN THEIR ARMORED SUITS
               AS THEY WAIT FOR A VACUUM ELEVATOR TO ARRIVE. TROOPS,
               BUREAUCRATS, AND ROBOTS BUSTLE ABOUT, IGNORING THE TRIO
               COMPLETELY. ONLY A FEW GIVE THE GIANT WOOKIEE A CURIOUS
               GLANCE.

               FINALLY A SMALL ELEVATOR ARRIVES AND THE TRIO ENTERS.

                                     LUKE
                         I CAN'T SEE A THING IN THIS HELMET.

               A BUREAUCRAT RACES TO GET ABOARD ALSO, BUT IS SIGNALED AWAY
               BY HAN. THE DOOR TO THE POD-LIKE VEHICLE SLIDES CLOSED AND
               THE ELEVATOR CAR TAKES OFF THROUGH A VACUUM TUBE.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY

               SEVERAL IMPERIAL OFFICERS WALK THROUGH THE WIDE MAIN
               PASSAGEWAY. THEY PASS SEVERAL STORMTROOPERS AND A ROBOT
               SIMILAR TO THREEPIO BUT WITH AN INSECT FACE. AT THE FAR END
               OF THE HALLWAY, A PASSING FLASH OF BEN KENOBI APPEARS, THEN
               DISAPPEARS DOWN A SMALL HALLWAY. HIS APPEARANCE IS SO FLEETING
               THAT IT IS HARD TO TELL IF HE IS REAL OR JUST AN ILLUSION.
               NO ONE IN THE HALLWAY SEEMS TO NOTICE HIM.

               INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY
               AREA

               LUKE AND HAN STEP FORWARD TO EXIT THE ELEVATOR, BUT THE DOOR
               SLIDES OPEN BEHIND THEM. THE GIANT WOOKIEE AND HIS TWO GUARDS
               ENTER THE OLD GREY SECURITY STATION. GUARDS AND LASER GATES
               ARE EVERYWHERE. HAN WHISPERS TO LUKE UNDER HIS BREATH.

                                     HAN
                         THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

                                     LUKE
                         WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO BEFORE?

                                     HAN
                         I DID SAY SO BEFORE!

               INT. DETENTION AREA

               ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. A TALL, GRIM LOOKING OFFICER APPROACHES
               THE TRIO.

                                     OFFICER
                         WHERE ARE YOU TAKING THIS... THING?

               CHEWIE GROWLS A BIT AT THE REMARK BUT HAN NUDGES HIM TO SHUT
               UP.

                                     LUKE
                         PRISONER TRANSFER FROM BLOCK ONE-ONE-
                         THREE-EIGHT.

                                     OFFICER
                         I WASN'T NOTIFIED. I'LL HAVE TO CLEAR
                         IT.

               THE OFFICER GOES BACK TO HIS CONSOLE AND BEGINS TO PUNCH IN
               THE INFORMATION. THERE ARE ONLY THREE OTHER TROOPERS IN THE
               AREA. LUKE AND HAN SURVEY THE SITUATION, CHECKING ALL OF THE
               ALARMS, LASER GATES, AND CAMERA EYES. HAN UNFASTENS ONE OF
               CHEWBACCA'S ELECTRONIC CUFFS AND SHRUGS TO LUKE.

               SUDDENLY CHEWBACCA THROWS UP HIS HANDS AND LETS OUT WITH ONE
               OF HIS EAR-PIERCING HOWLS. HE GRABS HAN'S LASER RIFLE.

                                     HAN
                         LOOK OUT! HE'S LOOSE!

                                     LUKE
                         HE'S GOING TO PULL US ALL APART.

                                     HAN
                         GO GET HIM!

               THE STARTLED GUARDS ARE MOMENTARILY DUMBFOUNDED. LUKE AND
               HAN HAVE ALREADY PULLED OUT THEIR LASER PISTOLS AND ARE
               BLASTING AWAY AT THE TERRIFYING WOOKIEE. THEIR BARRAGE OF
               LASERFIRE MISSES CHEWBACCA, BUT HITS THE CAMERA EYES, LASER
               GATE CONTROLS, AND THE IMPERIAL GUARDS. THE OFFICER IS THE
               LAST OF THE GUARDS TO FALL UNDER THE LASERFIRE JUST AS HE IS
               ABOUT TO PUSH THE ALARM SYSTEM. HAN RUSHES TO THE COMLINK
               SYSTEM, WHICH IS SCREECHING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING
               ON.  HE QUICKLY CHECKS THE COMPUTER READOUT.

                                     HAN
                         WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHICH CELL

               LUKE RACES DOWN ONE OF THE CELL CORRIDORS. HAN SPEAKS INTO
               THE BUZZING COMLINK.

               THE DAZZLING YOUNG PRINCESS-SENATOR. SHE HAD BEEN SLEEPING
               AND IS NOW LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN UNCOMPREHENDING LOOK ON

                         OH, NO!

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

               LUKE AND LEIA CROUCH TOGETHER IN AN ALCOVE FOR PROTECTION AS
               THEY CONTINUE TO EXCHANGE FIRE WITH TROOPS. HAN AND CHEWBACCA
               ARE BARELY ABLE TO KEEP THE STORMTROOPERS AT BAY AT THE FAR
               AND OF THE HALLWAY. THE LASERFIRE IS VERY INTENSE, AND SMOKE
               FILLS THE NARROW CELL CORRIDOR.

                                     LUKE
                         THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER WAY OUT.

                                     HAN
                         I CAN'T HOLD THEM OFF FOREVER! NOW
                         WHAT?

                                     LEIA
                         THIS IS SOME RESCUE. WHEN YOU CAME
                         IN HERE, DIDN'T YOU HAVE A PLAN FOR
                         GETTING OUT?

                                     HAN
                              (POINTING TO LUKE)
                         HE'S THE BRAINS, SWEETHEART.

               LUKE MANAGES A SHEEPISH GRIN AND SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS.

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, I DIDN'T...

               THE PRINCESS GRABS LUKE'S GUN AND FIRES AT A SMALL GRATE IN
               THE WALL NEXT TO HAN, ALMOST FRYING HIM.

                                     HAN
                         WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

                                     LEIA
                         SOMEBODY HAS TO SAVE OUR SKINS. INTO
                         THE GARBAGE CHUTE, WISE GUY.

               SHE JUMPS THROUGH THE NARROW OPENING AS HAN AND CHEWBACCA
               LOOK ON IN AMAZEMENT. CHEWBACCA SNIFFS THE GARBAGE CHUTE AND
               SAYS SOMETHING.

                                     HAN
                         GET IN THERE YOU BIG FURRY OAF! I
                         DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SMELL! GET IN
                         THERE AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

               HAN GIVES HIM A KICK AND THE WOOKIEE DISAPPEARS INTO THE
               TINY OPENING. LUKE AND HAN CONTINUE FIRING AS THEY WORK THEIR
               WAY TOWARD THE OPENING.

                                     HAN
                         WONDERFUL GIRL! EITHER I'M GOING TO
                         KILL HER OR I'M BEGINNING TO LIKE
                         HER. GET IN THERE!

               LUKE DUCKS LASERFIRE AS HE JUMPS INTO THE DARKNESS. HAN FIRES
               OFF A COUPLE OF QUICK BLASTS CREATING A SMOKEY COVER, THEN
               SLIDES INTO THE CHUTE HIMSELF AND IS GONE.

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               HAN TUMBLES INTO THE LARGE ROOM FILLED WITH GARBAGE AND MUCK.
               LUKE IS ALREADY STUMBLING AROUND LOOKING FOR AN EXIT. HE
               FINDS A SMALL HATCHWAY AND STRUGGLES TO GET IT OPEN. IT WON'T
               BUDGE.

                                     HAN
                              (SARCASTICALLY)
                         OH! THE GARBAGE CHUTE WAS A REALLY
                         WONDERFUL IDEA. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE
                         SMELL YOU'VE DISCOVERED! LET'S GET
                         OUT OF HERE! GET AWAY FROM THERE...

                                     LUKE
                         NO! WAIT!

               HAN DRAWS HIS LASER PISTOL AND FIRES AT THE HATCH. THE
               LASERBOLT RICOCHETS WILDLY AROUND THE SMALL METAL ROOM.
               EVERYONE DIVES FOR COVER IN THE GARBAGE AS THE BOLT EXPLODES
               ALMOST ON TOP OF THEM. LEIA CLIMBS OUT OF THE GARBAGE WITH A
               RATHER GRIM LOOK ON HER FACE.

                                     LUKE
                         WILL YOU FORGET IT? I ALREADY TRIED
                         IT. IT'S MAGNETICALLY SEALED!

                                     LEIA
                         PUT THAT THING AWAY! YOU'RE GOING TO
                         GET US ALL KILLED.

                                     HAN
                         ABSOLUTELY, YOUR WORSHIP. LOOK, I
                         HAD EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL UNTIL
                         YOU LED US DOWN HERE. YOU KNOW, IT'S
                         NOT GOING TO TAKE THEM LONG TO FIGURE
                         OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO US.

                                     LEIA
                         IT COULD BE WORSE...

               A LOUD, HORRIBLE, INHUMAN MOAN WORKS ITS WAY UP FROM THE
               MURKY DEPTHS. CHEWBACCA LETS OUT A TERRIFIED HOWL AND BEGINS
               TO BACK AWAY. HAN AND LUKE STAND FAST WITH THEIR LASER PISTOLS
               DRAWN. THE WOOKIEE IS COWERING NEAR ONE OF THE WALLS.

                                     HAN
                         IT'S WORSE.

                                     LUKE
                         THERE'S SOMETHING ALIVE IN HERE!

                                     HAN
                         THAT'S YOUR IMAGINATION.

                                     LUKE
                         SOMETHING JUST MOVES PAST MY LEG!
                         LOOK! DID YOU SEE THAT?

                                     HAN
                         WHAT?

                                     LUKE
                         HELP!

               SUDDENLY LUKE IS YANKED UNDER THE GARBAGE.

                                     HAN
                         LUKE! LUKE! LUKE!

               SOLO TRIES TO GET TO LUKE. LUKE SURFACES WITH A GASP OF AIR
               AND THRASHING OF LIMBS. A MEMBRANE TENTACLE IS WRAPPED AROUND
               HIS THROAT.

                                     LEIA
                         LUKE!

               LEIA EXTENDS A LONG PIPE TOWARD HIM.

                                     LEIA
                         LUKE, LUKE, GRAB A HOLD OF THIS.

                                     LUKE
                         BLAST IT, WILL YOU! MY GUN'S JAMMED.

                                     HAN
                         WHERE?

                                     LUKE
                         ANYWHERE! OH!!

               SOLO FIRES HIS GUN DOWNWARD. LUKE IS PULLED BACK INTO THE
               MUCK BY THE SLIMY TENTACLE.

                                     HAN
                         LUKE! LUKE!

               SUDDENLY THE WALLS OF THE GARBAGE RECEPTACLE SHUDDER AND
               MOVE IN A COUPLE OF INCHES. THEN EVERYTHING IS DEATHLY QUIET.
               HAN AND LEIA GIVE EACH OTHER A WORRIED LOOK AS CHEWBACCA
               HOWLS IN THE CORNER. WITH A RUSH OF BUBBLES AND MUCK LUKE
               SUDDENLY BOBS TO THE SURFACE.

                                     LEIA
                         GRAB HIM!

               LUKE SEEMS TO BE RELEASED BY THE THING.

                                     LEIA
                         WHAT HAPPENED?

                                     LUKE
                         I DON'T KNOW, IT JUST LET GO OF ME
                         AND DISAPPEARED...

                                     HAN
                         I'VE GOT A VERY BAD FEELING ABOUT
                         THIS.

               BEFORE ANYONE CAN SAY ANYTHING THE WALLS BEGIN TO RUMBLE AND
               EDGE TOWARD THE REBELS.

                                     LUKE
                         THE WALLS ARE MOVING!

                                     LEIA
                         DON'T JUST STAND THERE. TRY TO BRACE
                         IT WITH SOMETHING.

               THEY PLACE POLES AND LONG METAL BEAMS BETWEEN THE CLOSING
               WALLS, BUT THEY ARE SIMPLY SNAPPED AND BENT AS THE GIANT
               TRASHMASHER RUMBLES ON. THE SITUATION DOESN'T LOOK TOO GOOD.

                                     LUKE
                         WAIT A MINUTE!

               LUKE PULLS OUT HIS COMLINK.

                                     LUKE
                         THREEPIO! COME IN THREEPIO! THREEPIO!
                         WHERE COULD HE BE?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE

               A SOFT BUZZER AND THE MUTED VOICE OF LUKE CALLING OUT FOR
               SEE-THREEPIO CAN BE HEARD ON THREEPIO'S HAND COMLINK, WHICH
               IS SITTING ON THE DESERTED COMPUTER CONSOLE. ARTOO AND
               THREEPIO ARE NOWHERE IN SIGHT. SUDDENLY THERE IS A GREAT
               EXPLOSION AND THE DOOR OF THE CONTROL TOWER FLIES ACROSS THE
               FLOOR. FOUR ARMED STORMTROOPERS ENTER THE CHAMBER.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         TAKE OVER!
                              (POINTING TO THE DEAD
                              OFFICER)
                         SEE TO HIM! LOOK THERE!

               A TROOPER PUSHES A BUTTON AND THE SUPPLY CABINET DOOR SLIDES
               OPEN. SEE-THREEPIO AND ARTOO-DETOO ARE INSIDE. ARTOO FOLLOWS
               HIS BRONZE COMPANION OUT INTO THE OFFICE.

                                     THREEPIO
                         THEY'RE MADMEN! THEY'RE HEADING FOR
                         THE PRISON LEVEL. IF YOU HURRY, YOU
                         MIGHT CATCH THEM.

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                              (TO HIS TROOPS)
                         FOLLOW ME! YOU STAND GUARD.

               THE TROOPS HUSTLE OFF DOWN THE HALLWAY, LEAVING A GUARD TO
               WATCH OVER THE COMMAND OFFICE.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (TO ARTOO)
                         COME ON!

               THE GUARD AIMS A BLASTER AT THEM.

                                     THREEPIO
                         OH! ALL THIS EXCITEMENT HAS OVERRUN
                         THE CIRCUITS OF MY COUNTERPART HERE.
                         IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO TAKE
                         HIM DOWN TO MAINTENANCE.

                                     TROOPER
                         ALL RIGHT.

               THE GUARD NODS AND THREEPIO, WITH LITTLE ARTOO IN TOW, HURRIES
               OUT THE DOOR.

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               AS THE WALLS RUMBLE CLOSED, THE ROOM GETS SMALLER AND SMALLER.
               CHEWIE IS WHINING AND TRYING TO HOLD A WALL BACK WITH HIS
               GIANT PAWS.

               HAN IS LEANING BACK AGAINST THE OTHER WALL. GARBAGE IS
               SNAPPING AND POPPING. LUKE IS TRYING TO REACH THREEPIO.

                                     LUKE
                         THREEPIO! COME IN, THREEPIO! THREEPIO!

               HAN AND LEIA TRY TO BRACE THE CONTRACTING WALLS WITH A POLE.
               LEIA BEGINS TO SINK INTO THE TRASH.

                                     HAN
                         GET TO THE TOP!

                         WHERE COULD HE BE? THREEPIO! THREEPIO,
                         WILL YOU COME IN?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

                         THEY AREN'T HERE! SOMETHING MUST
                         HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM. SEE IF THEY'VE
                         BEEN CAPTURED.

               LITTLE ARTOO CAREFULLY PLUGS HIS CLAW ARM INTO A NEW WALL
               SOCKET AND A COMPLEX ARRAY OF ELECTRONIC SOUNDS SPEW FROM
               THE TINY ROBOT.

                                     THREEPIO
                         HURRY!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               THE WALLS ARE ONLY FEET APART. LEIA AND HAN ARE BRACED AGAINST
               THE WALLS. THE PRINCESS IS FRIGHTENED. THEY LOOK AT EACH
               OTHER. LEIA REACHES OUT AND TAKES HAN'S HAND AND SHE HOLDS
               IT TIGHTLY. SHE'S TERRIFIED AND SUDDENLY GROANS AS SHE FEELS
               THE FIRST CRUSHING PRESSURE AGAINST HER BODY.

                                     HAN
                         ONE THING'S FOR SURE. WE'RE ALL GOING
                         TO BE A LOT THINNER!

                         THEM! WHERE COULD THEY BE?

               ARTOO FRANTICALLY BEEPS SOMETHING TO SEE-THREEPIO.

                                     THREEPIO
                         USE THE COMLINK? OH, MY! I FORGOT I
                         TURNED IT OFF!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               MEANWHILE, LUKE IS LYING ON HIS SIDE, TRYING TO KEEP HIS
               HEAD ABOVE THE RISING OOZE. LUKE'S COMLINK BEGINS TO BUZZ
               AND HE RIPS IT OFF HIS BELT.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

               MUFFLED SOUNDS OF LUKE'S VOICE OVER THE COMLINK CAN BE HEARD,
               BUT NOT DISTINCTLY.

                                     THREEPIO
                         ARE YOU THERE, SIR?

                         WE'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS...

                              (OVER COMLINK)
                         WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME?
                         SHUT DOWN ALL GARBAGE MASHERS ON THE

                         NO. SHUT THEM ALL DOWN! HURRY!

               THREEPIO HOLDS HIS HEAD IN AGONY AS HE HEARS THE INCREDIBLE
               SCREAMING AND HOLLERING FROM LUKE'S COMLINK.

                                     THREEPIO
                         LISTEN TO THEM! THEY'RE DYING, ARTOO!
                         CURSE MY METAL BODY! I WASN'T FAST
                         ENOUGH. IT'S ALL MY FAULT! MY POOR

                         THREEPIO, WE'RE ALL RIGHT!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               THE SCREAMING AND HOLLERING IS THE SOUND OF JOYOUS RELIEF.
               THE WALLS HAVE STOPPED MOVING. HAN, CHEWIE AND LEIA EMBRACE
               IN THE BACKGROUND.

                                     LUKE
                         WE'RE ALL RIGHT. YOU DID GREAT.

               LUKE MOVES TO THE PRESSURE SENSITIVE HATCH, LOOKING FOR A
               NUMBER.

                                     LUKE
                         HEY... HEY, OPEN THE PRESSURE

               INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH

               BEN ENTERS A HUMMING SERVICE TRENCH THAT POWERS THE HUGE
               TRACTOR BEAM. THE TRENCH SEEMS TO BE A HUNDRED MILES DEEP.
               THE CLACKING SOUND OF HUGE SWITCHING DEVICES CAN BE HEARD.
               THE OLD JEDI EDGES HIS HIS WAY ALONG A NARROW LEDGE LEADING
               TO A CONTROL PANEL THAT CONNECTS TWO LARGE CABLES. HE
               CAREFULLY MAKES SEVERAL ADJUSTMENTS IN THE COMPUTER TERMINAL,
               AND SEVERAL LIGHTS ON THE BOARD GO FROM RED TO BLUE.

               INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY

               THE GROUP EXITS THE GARBAGE ROOM INTO A DUSTY, UNUSED HALLWAY.
               HAN AND LUKE REMOVE THE TROOPER SUITS AND STRAP ON THE BLASTER
               BELTS.

                                     HAN
                         IF WE CAN JUST AVOID ANY MORE FEMALE
                         ADVICE, WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET
                         OUT OF HERE.

               LUKE SMILES AND SCRATCHES HIS HEAD AS HE TAKES A BLASTER
               FROM SOLO.

                                     LUKE
                         WELL, LET'S GET MOVING!

               CHEWIE BEGINS GROWLING AND POINTS TO THE HATCH TO THE GARBAGE
               ROOM, AS HE RUNS AWAY AND THEN STOPS HOWLING.

                                     HAN
                              (TO CHEWIE)
                         WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

               THE DIA NOGU BANGS AGAINST THE HATCH AND A LONG, SLIMY
               TENTACLE WORKS ITS WAY OUT OF THE DOORWAY SEARCHING FOR A
               VICTIM. HAN AIMS HIS PISTOL.

                                     LEIA
                         NO, WAIT. THEY'LL HEAR!

               HAN FIRES AT THE DOORWAY. THE NOISE OF THE BLAST ECHOES
               RELENTLESSLY THROUGHOUT THE EMPTY PASSAGEWAY. LUKE SIMPLY
               SHAKES HIS HEAD IN DISGUST.

                                     HAN
                              (TO CHEWIE)
                         COME HERE, YOU BIG COWARD!

               CHEWIE SHAKES HIS HEAD "NO."

                                     HAN

                         ON, YOU DO AS I TELL YOU. OKAY?

               HAN IS STUNNED AT THE COMMAND OF THE PETITE YOUNG GIRL.

                                     HAN
                         LOOK, YOUR WORSHIPFULNESS, LET'S GET
                         ONE THING STRAIGHT! I TAKE ORDERS
                         FROM ONE PERSON! ME!

                         WILL SOMEBODY GET THIS BIG WALKING
                         CARPET OUT OF MY WAY?

               HAN WATCHES HER START AWAY. HE LOOKS AT LUKE.

                                     HAN
                         NO REWARD IS WORTH THIS.

               THEY FOLLOW HER, MOVING SWIFTLY DOWN THE DESERTED CORRIDOR.

               INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH

               SUDDENLY A DOOR BEHIND BEN SLIDES OPEN AND A DETACHMENT OF
               STORMTROOPERS MARCHES TO THE POWER TRENCH. BEN INSTANTLY
               SLIPS INTO THE SHADOWS AS AN OFFICER MOVES TO WITHIN A FEW
               FEET OF HIM.

                                     OFFICER
                         SECURE THIS AREA UNTIL THE ALERT IS
                         CANCELED.

                         GIVE ME REGULAR REPORTS.

               ALL BUT TWO OF THE STORMTROOPERS LEAVE.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         MAYBE IT'S ANOTHER DRILL.

               BEN MOVES AROUND THE TRACTOR BEAM, WATCHING THE STORMTROOPERS
               AS THEY TURN THEIR BACKS TO HIM. BEN GESTURES WITH HIS HAND
               TOWARD THEM, AS THE TROOPS THINK THEY HEAR SOMETHING IN THE
               OTHER HALLWAY. WITH THE HELP OF THE FORCE, BEN DEFTLY SLIPS
               PAST THE TROOPERS AND INTO THE MAIN HALLWAY.

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         WHAT WAS THAT?

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         OH, IT'S NOTHING. DON'T WORRY ABOUT
                         IT.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               LUKE, HAN, CHEWBACCA, AND LEIA RUN DOWN AN EMPTY HALLWAY AND
               STOP BEFORE A BAY WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE PIRATESHIP. TROOPERS
               ARE MILLING ABOUT THE SHIP. LUKE TAKES OUT HIS POCKET COMLINK.

                                     HAN
                              (LOOKING AT HIS SHIP)
                         THERE SHE IS.

                                     LUKE
                         SEE-THREEPIO, DO YOU COPY?

                                     THREEPIO
                              (VOICE)
                         FOR THE MOMENT. UH, WE'RE IN THE
                         MAIN HANGAR ACROSS FROM THE SHIP.

                                     LUKE
                         WE'RE RIGHT ABOVE YOU. STAND BY.

               HAN IS WATCHING THE DOZEN OR SO TROOPS MOVING IN AND OUT OF
               THE PIRATESHIP. LEIA MOVES TOWARDS HAN, TOUCHES HIS ARM AND
               POINTS OUT THE WINDOW TO THE SHIP.

                                     LEIA
                         YOU CAME IN THAT THING? YOU'RE BRAVER
                         THAT I THOUGHT.

                                     HAN
                         NICE! COME ON!

               HAN GIVES HER A DIRTY LOOK, AND THEY START OFF DOWN THE
               HALLWAY. THEY ROUND A CORNER AND RUN RIGHT INTO TWENTY
               IMPERIAL STORMTROOPERS HEADING TOWARD THEM. BOTH GROUPS ARE
               TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND STOP IN THEIR TRACKS.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         IT'S THEM! BLAST THEM!

               BEFORE EVEN THINKING, HAN DRAWS HIS LASER PISTOL AND CHARGES
               THE TROOPS, FIRING. HIS BLASTER KNOCKS ONE OF THE
               STORMTROOPERS INTO THE AIR. CHEWIE FOLLOWS HIS CAPTAIN DOWN
               THE CORRIDOR, STEPPING OVER THE FALLEN TROOPER ON THE FLOOR.

                                     HAN
                              (TO LUKE AND LEIA)
                         GET BACK TO THE SHIP!

                                     LUKE
                         WHERE ARE YOU GOING? COME BACK!

               HAN HAS ALREADY ROUNDED A CORNER AND DOES NOT HEAR.

                                     LEIA
                         HE CERTAINLY HAS COURAGE.

                                     LUKE
                         WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO US IF HE GETS
                         HIMSELF KILLED? COME ON!

               LUKE IS FURIOUS BUT DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT FOR
               MUTED ALARMS BEGIN TO GO OFF DOWN ON THE HANGAR DECK. LUKE
               AND LEIA START OFF TOWARD THE STARSHIP HANGAR.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               HAN CHASES THE STORMTROOPERS DOWN A LONG SUBHALLWAY. HE IS
               YELLING AND BRANDISHING HIS LASER PISTOL. THE TROOPS REACH A
               DEAD END AND ARE FORCED TO TURN AND FIGHT. HAN STOPS A FEW
               FEET FROM THEM AND ASSUMES A DEFENSIVE POSITION. THE TROOPS
               BEGIN TO RAISE THEIR LASER GUNS. SOON ALL TEN TROOPERS ARE
               MOVING INTO AN ATTACK POSITION IN FRONT OF THE LONE
               STARPIRATE. HAN'S DETERMINED LOOK BEGINS TO FADE AS THE TROOPS
               BEGIN TO ADVANCE. SOLO JUMPS BACKWARD AS THEY FIRE AT HIM.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               CHEWBACCA RUNS DOWN THE SUBHALLWAY IN A LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT
               TO SAVE HIS BOLD CAPTAIN. SUDDENLY HE HEARS THE FIRING OF
               LASER GUNS AND YELLING. AROUND THE CORNER SHOOTS HAN, PIRATE
               EXTRAORDINAIRE, RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE, FOLLOWED BY A HOST OF
               FURIOUS STORMTROOPERS. CHEWBACCA TURNS AND STARTS RUNNING
               THE OTHER WAY ALSO.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               LUKE FIRES HIS LASER PISTOL WILDLY AS HE AND LEIA RUSH DOWN
               A NARROW SUBHALLWAY, CHASED BY SEVERAL STORMTROOPERS. THEY
               QUICKLY REACH THE END OF THE SUBHALLWAY AND RACE THROUGH AN
               OPEN HATCHWAY.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT

               LUKE AND LEIA RACE THROUGH THE HATCH ONTO A NARROW BRIDGE
               THAT SPANS A HUGE, DEEP SHAFT THAT SEEMS TO GO INTO INFINITY.
               THE BRIDGE HAS BEEN RETRACTED INTO THE WALL OF THE SHAFT,
               AND LUKE ALMOST RUSHES INTO THE ABYSS. HE LOSES HIS BALANCE
               OFF THE END OF THE BRIDGE AS LEIA, BEHIND HIM, TAKES HOLD OF
               HIS ARM AND PULLS HIM BACK.

                                     LUKE
                              (GASPING)
                         I THINK WE TOOK A WRONG TURN.

               BLASTS FROM THE STORMTROOPERS' LASER GUNS EXPLODE NEARBY
               REMINDING THEM OF THE ONCOMING DANGER. LUKE FIRES BACK AT
               THE ADVANCING TROOPS. LEIA REACHES OVER AND HITS A SWITCH
               THAT POPS THE HATCH DOOR SHUT WITH A RESOUNDING BOOM, LEAVING
               THEM PRECARIOUSLY PERCHED ON A SHORT PIECE OF BRIDGE OVERHANG.
               LASERFIRE FROM THE TROOPERS CONTINUES TO HIT THE STEEL DOOR.

                                     LEIA
                         THERE'S NO LOCK!

               LUKE BLASTS THE CONTROLS WITH HIS LASER PISTOL.

                                     LUKE
                         THAT OUGHTA HOLD IT FOR A WHILE.

                                     LEIA
                         QUICK, WE'VE GOT TO GET ACROSS. FIND
                         THE CONTROL THAT EXTENDS THE BRIDGE.

                                     LUKE
                         OH, I THINK I JUST BLASTED IT.

               LUKE LOOKS AT THE BLASTED BRIDGE CONTROL WHILE THE
               STORMTROOPERS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE DOOR BEGIN MAKING
               OMINOUS DRILLING AND POUNDING SOUNDS.

                                     LEIA
                         THEY'RE COMING THROUGH!

               LUKE NOTICES SOMETHING ON HIS STORMTROOPER BELT, WHEN
               LASERFIRE HITS THE WALL BEHIND HIM. LUKE AIMS HIS LASER PISTOL
               AT A STORMTROOPER PERCHED ON A HIGHER BRIDGE OVERHANG ACROSS
               THE ABYSS FROM THEM. THEY EXCHANGE FIRE. TWO MORE TROOPS
               APPEAR ON ANOTHER OVERHANG, ALSO FIRING. A TROOPER IS HIT,
               AND GRABS AT HIS CHEST.

               ANOTHER TROOPER STANDING ON THE BRIDGE OVERHANG IS HIT BY
               LUKE'S LASERFIRE, AND PLUMMETS DOWN THE SHAFT. TROOPERS MOVE
               BACK OFF THE BRIDGE; LUKE HANDS THE GUN TO LEIA.

                                     LUKE
                         HERE, HOLD THIS.

               LUKE PULLS A THIN NYLON CABLE FROM HIS TROOPER UTILITY BELT.
               IT HAS A GRAPPLER HOOK ON IT. A TROOPER APPEARS ON A BRIDGE
               OVERHANG AND FIRES AT LUKE AND LEIA. AS LUKE WORKS WITH THE
               ROPE, LEIA RETURNS THE LASER VOLLEY. ANOTHER TROOPER APPEARS
               AND FIRES AT THEM, AS LEIA RETURNS HIS FIRE AS WELL.
               SUDDENLY, THE HATCH DOOR BEGINS TO OPEN, REVEALING THE FEET
               OF MORE TROOPS.

                                     LEIA
                         HERE THEY COME!

               LEIA HITS ONE OF THE STORMTROOPERS ON THE BRIDGE ABOVE, AND
               HE FALLS INTO THE ABYSS. LUKE TOSSES THE ROPE ACROSS THE
               GORGE AND IT WRAPS ITSELF AROUND AN OUTCROPPING OF PIPES. HE
               TUGS ON THE ROPE TO MAKE SURE IT IS SECURE, THEN GRABS THE
               PRINCESS IN HIS ARMS. LEIA LOOKS AT LUKE, THEN KISSES HIM
               QUICKLY ON THE LIPS. LUKE IS VERY SURPRISED.

                                     LEIA
                         FOR LUCK!

               LUKE PUSHES OFF AND THEY SWING ACROSS THE TREACHEROUS ABYSS
               TO THE CORRESPONDING HATCHWAY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE. JUST AS
               LUKE AND LEIA REACH THE FAR SIDE OF THE CANYON, THE
               STORMTROOPERS BREAK THROUGH THE HATCH AND BEGIN TO FIRE AT
               THE ESCAPING DUO. LUKE RETURNS THE FIRE BEFORE DUCKING INTO
               THE TINY SUBHALLWAY.

               INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY

               BEN HIDES IN THE SHADOWS OF THE NARROW PASSAGEWAY AS SEVERAL
               STORMTROOPERS RUSH PAST HIM IN THE MAIN HALLWAY. HE CHECKS
               TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GONE, THEN RUNS DOWN THE HALLWAY IN THE
               OPPOSITE DIRECTION. DARTH VADER APPEARS AT THE FAR END OF
               THE HALLWAY AND STARTS AFTER THE OLD JEDI.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               THREEPIO LOOKS AROUND AT THE TROOPS MILLING ABOUT THE
               PIRATESHIP ENTRY RAMP.

                                     THREEPIO
                         WHERE COULD THEY BE?

               ARTOO, PLUGGED INTO THE COMPUTER SOCKET, TURNS HIS DOME LEFT
               AND RIGHT, BEEPING A RESPONSE.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR

               HAN AND CHEWBACCA RUN DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR WITH SEVERAL
               TROOPERS HOT ON THEIR TRAIL.

                                     TROOPER
                         CLOSE THE BLAST DOORS!

               AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY, BLAST DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE IN
               FRONT OF THEM. THE YOUNG STARPILOT AND HIS FURRY COMPANION
               RACE PAST THE HUGE DOORS JUST AS THEY ARE CLOSING, AND MANAGE
               TO GET OFF A COUPLE OFF LASERBLASTS AT THE PURSUING TROOPS
               BEFORE THE DOORS SLAM SHUT.

                                     TROOPER
                         OPEN THE BLAST DOORS! OPEN THE BLAST
                         DOORS!

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY

               BEN HURRIES ALONG ONE OF THE TUNNELS LEADING TO THE HANGAR
               WHERE THE PIRATESHIP WAITS. JUST BEFORE HE REACHES THE HANGAR,
               DARTH VADER STEPS INTO VIEW AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL, NOT
               TEN FEET AWAY. VADER LIGHTS HIS SABER. BEN ALSO IGNITES HIS
               AND STEPS SLOWLY FORWARD.

                                     VADER
                         I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU, OBI-WAN.
                         WE MEET AGAIN, AT LAST. THE CIRCLE
                         IS NOW COMPLETE.

               BEN KENOBI MOVES WITH ELEGANT EASE INTO A CLASSICAL OFFENSIVE
               POSITION. THE FEARSOME DARK KNIGHT TAKES A DEFENSIVE STANCE.

                                     VADER
                         WHEN I LEFT YOU, I WAS BUT THE
                         LEARNER; NOW I AM THE MASTER.

                                     BEN
                         ONLY A MASTER OF EVIL, DARTH.

               THE TWO GALACTIC WARRIORS STAND PERFECTLY STILL FOR A FEW
               MOMENTS, SIZING EACH OTHER UP AND WAITING FOR THE RIGHT
               MOMENT. BEN SEEMS TO BE UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE AND STRAIN,
               AS IF AN INVISIBLE WEIGHT WERE BEING PLACED UPON HIM. HE
               SHAKES HIS HEAD AND, BLINKING, TRIES TO CLEAR HIS EYES.

               BEN MAKES A SUDDEN LUNGE AT THE HUGE WARRIOR BUT IS CHECKED
               BY A LIGHTNING MOVEMENT OF THE SITH. A MASTERFUL SLASH STROKE
               BY VADER IS BLOCKED BY THE OLD JEDI. ANOTHER OF THE JEDI'S
               BLOWS IS BLOCKED, THEN COUNTERED. BEN MOVES AROUND THE DARK
               LORD AND STARTS BACKING INTO THE MASSIVE STARSHIP HANGAR.
               THE TWO POWERFUL WARRIORS STAND MOTIONLESS FOR A FEW MOMENTS
               WITH LASER SWORDS LOCKED IN MID-AIR, CREATING A LOW BUZZING
               SOUND.

                                     VADER
                         YOUR POWERS ARE WEAK, OLD MAN.

                                     BEN
                         YOU CAN'T WIN, DARTH. IF YOU STRIKE
                         ME DOWN, I SHALL BECOME MORE POWERFUL
                         THAN YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

               THEIR LIGHTSABERS CONTINUE TO MEET IN COMBAT.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA, THEIR WEAPONS IN HAND, LEAN BACK
               AGAINST THE WALL SURVEYING THE FORWARD BAY, WATCHING THE
               IMPERIAL STORMTROOPERS MAKE THEIR ROUNDS OF THE HANGAR.

                                     HAN
                         DIDN'T WE JUST LEAVE THIS PARTY?

               CHEWBACCA GROWLS A REPLY, AS LUKE AND THE PRINCESS JOIN THEM.

                                     HAN
                         WHAT KEPT YOU?

                                     LEIA
                         WE RAN INTO SOME OLD FRIENDS.

                                     LUKE
                         IS THE SHIP ALL RIGHT?

                                     HAN
                         SEEMS OKAY, IF WE CAN GET TO IT.
                         JUST HOPE THE OLD MAN GOT THE TRACTOR
                         BEAM OUT OF COMMISSION.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               VADER AND BEN KENOBI CONTINUE THEIR POWERFUL DUEL. AS THEY
               HIT THEIR LIGHTSABERS TOGETHER, LIGHTNING FLASHES ON IMPACT.
               TROOPERS LOOK ON IN INTEREST AS THE OLD JEDI AND DARK LORD
               OF THE SITH FIGHT. SUDDENLY LUKE SPOTS THE BATTLE FROM HIS
               GROUP'S VANTAGE POINT.

                                     LUKE
                         LOOK!

               LUKE, LEIA, HAN, AND CHEWIE LOOK UP AND SEE BEN AND VADER
               EMERGING FROM THE HALLWAYS ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE DOCKING
               BAY.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY

               THREEPIO AND ARTOO-DETOO ARE IN THE CENTER OF THE DEATH STAR'S
               IMPERIAL DOCKING BAY.

                                     THREEPIO
                         COME ON, ARTOO, WE'RE GOING!

               THREEPIO DUCKS OUT OF SIGHT AS THE SEVEN STORMTROOPERS WHO
               WERE GUARDING THE STARSHIP RUSH PAST THEM HEADING TOWARDS
               BEN AND THE SITH KNIGHT. HE PULLS ON ARTOO.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               SOLO, CHEWIE, LUKE, AND LEIA TENSELY WATCH THE DUEL. THE
               TROOPS RUSH TOWARD THE BATTLING KNIGHTS.

                                     HAN
                         NOW'S OUR CHANCE! GO!

               THEY START FOR THE MILLENNIUM FALCON. BEN SEES THE TROOPS
               CHARGING TOWARD HIM AND REALIZES THAT HE IS TRAPPED. VADER
               TAKES ADVANTAGE OF BEN'S MOMENTARY DISTRACTION AND BRINGS
               HIS MIGHTY LIGHTSABER DOWN ON THE OLD MAN. BEN MANAGES TO
               DEFLECT THE BLOW AND SWIFTLY TURNS AROUND.

               THE OLD JEDI KNIGHT LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER AT LUKE, LIFTS
               HIS SWORD FROM VADER'S THEN WATCHES HIS OPPONENT WITH A SERENE
               LOOK ON HIS FACE.

               VADER BRINGS HIS SWORD DOWN, CUTTING OLD BEN IN HALF. BEN'S
               CLOAK FALLS TO THE FLOOR IN TWO PARTS, BUT BEN IS NOT IN IT.
               VADER IS PUZZLED AT BEN'S DISAPPEARANCE AND POKES AT THE
               EMPTY CLOAK. AS THE GUARDS ARE DISTRACTED, THE ADVENTURERS
               AND THE ROBOTS REACH THE STARSHIP. LUKE SEES BEN CUT IN TWO
               AND STARTS FOR HIM. AGHAST, HE YELLS OUT.

                                     LUKE
                         NO!

               THE STORMTROOPERS TURN TOWARD LUKE AND BEGIN FIRING AT HIM.
               THE ROBOTS ARE ALREADY MOVING UP THE RAMP INTO THE MILLENNIUM
               FALCON, WHILE LUKE, TRANSFIXED BY ANGER AND AWE, RETURNS
               THEIR FIRE. SOLO JOINS IN THE LASERFIRE. VADER LOOKS UP AND
               ADVANCES TOWARD THEM, AS ONE OF HIS TROOPERS IS STRUCK DOWN.

                                     HAN
                              (TO LUKE)
                         COME ON!

                                     LEIA
                         COME ON! LUKE, ITS TOO LATE!

                                     HAN
                         BLAST THE DOOR! KID!

               LUKE FIRES HIS PISTOL AT THE DOOR CONTROL PANEL, AND IT
               EXPLODES. THE DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE SHUT. THREE TROOPERS CHARGE
               FORWARD FIRING LASER BOLTS, AS THE DOOR SLIDES TO A CLOSE
               BEHIND THEM, SHUTTING VADER AND THE OTHER TROOPS OUT OF THE
               DOCKING BAY. A STORMTROOPER LIES DEAD AT THE FEET OF HIS
               ONRUSHING COMPATRIOTS. LUKE STARTS FOR THE ADVANCING TROOPS,
               AS SOLO AND LEIA MOVE UP THE RAMP INTO THE PIRATESHIP. HE
               FIRES, HITTING A STORMTROOPER, WHO CRUMBLES TO THE FLOOR.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         RUN, LUKE! RUN!

               LUKE LOOKS AROUND TO SEE WHERE THE VOICE CAME FROM. HE TURNS
               TOWARD THE PIRATESHIP, DUCKING IMPERIAL GUNFIRE FROM THE
               TROOPERS AND RACES INTO THE SHIP.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               HAN PULLS BACK ON THE CONTROLS AND THE SHIP BEGINS TO MOVE.
               THE DULL THUD OF LASER BOLTS BOUNCING OFF THE OUTSIDE OF THE
               SHIP AS CHEWIE ADJUSTS HIS CONTROLS.

                                     HAN
                         I HOPE THE OLD MAN GOT THAT TRACTOR
                         BEAM OUT IF COMMISSION, OR THIS IS
                         GOING TO BE A REAL SHORT TRIP. OKAY,
                         HIT IT!

               CHEWBACCA GROWLS IN AGREEMENT.

               EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

               THE MILLENNIUM FALCON POWERS AWAY FROM THE DEATH STAR DOCKING
               BAY, MAKES A SPECTACULAR TURN AND DISAPPEARS INTO THE VASTNESS
               OF SPACE.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               LUKE, SADDENED BY THE LOSS OF OBI-WAN KENOBI, STARES OFF
               BLANKLY AS THE ROBOTS LOOK ON. LEIA PUTS A BLANKET AROUND
               HIM PROTECTIVELY, AND LUKE TURNS AND LOOKS UP AT HER. SHE
               SITS DOWN BESIDE HIM.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               SOLO SPOTS APPROACHING ENEMY SHIPS.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               LUKE LOOKS DOWNWARD SADLY, SHAKING HIS HEAD BACK AND FORTH,
               AS THE PRINCESS SMILES COMFORTINGLY AT HIM.

                                     LUKE
                         I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S GONE.

               DISCUSSION BY THE BUZZ OF THE COMLINK. TARKIN MOVES TO ANSWER
               THE CALL.

                                     TARKIN
                         YES.

               DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

               WE ARE APPROACHING THE PLANET YAVIN. THE REBEL BASE IS ON A
               MOON ON THE FAR SIDE. WE ARE PREPARING TO ORBIT THE PLANET.

               EXT. YAVIN - JUNGLE

               A LONE GUARD STANDS IN A TOWER HIGH ABOVE THE YAVIN LANDSCAPE,
               SURVEYING THE COUNTRYSIDE. A MIST HANGS OVER THE JUNGLE OF
               TWISTED GREEN.

               INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA

               DODONNA STANDS BEFORE A LARGE ELECTRONIC WALL DISPLAY. LEIA
               AND SEVERAL OTHER SENATORS ARE TO ONE SIDE OF THE GIANT
               READOUT. THE LOW-CEILINGED ROOM IS FILLED WITH STARPILOTS,
               NAVIGATORS, AND A SPRINKLING OF R2-TYPE ROBOTS. EVERYONE IS
               LISTENING INTENTLY TO WHAT DODONNA IS SAYING. HAN AND
               CHEWBACCA ARE STANDING NEAR THE BACK.

                                     DODONNA
                         THE BATTLE STATION IS HEAVILY SHIELDED
                         AND CARRIES A FIREPOWER GREATER THAN
                         HALF THE STAR FLEET. IT'S DEFENSES
                         ARE DESIGNED AROUND A DIRECT LARGE-
                         SCALE ASSAULT. A SMALL ONE-MAN FIGHTER
                         SHOULD BE ABLE TO PENETRATE THE OUTER
                         DEFENSE.

               GOLD LEADER, A ROUGH LOOKING MAN IN HIS EARLY THIRTIES, STANDS
               AND ADDRESSES DODONNA.

                                     GOLD LEADER
                         PARDON ME FOR ASKING, SIR, BUT WHAT
                         GOOD ARE SNUB FIGHTERS GOING TO BE
                         AGAINST THAT?

                                     DODONNA
                         WELL, THE EMPIRE DOESN'T CONSIDER A
                         SMALL ONE-MAN FIGHTER TO BE ANY
                         THREAT, OR THEY'D HAVE A TIGHTER
                         DEFENSE. AN ANALYSIS OF THE PLANS
                         PROVIDED BY PRINCESS LEIA HAS
                         DEMONSTRATED A WEAKNESS IN THE BATTLE
                         STATION.

               ARTOO-DETOO STANDS NEXT TO A SIMILAR ROBOT, MAKES BEEPING
               SOUNDS, AND TURNS HIS HEAD FROM RIGHT TO LEFT.

                                     DODONNA
                         THE APPROACH WILL NOT BE EASY. YOU
                         ARE REQUIRED TO MANEUVER STRAIGHT
                         DOWN THIS TRENCH AND SKIM THE SURFACE
                         TO THIS POINT. THE TARGET AREA IS
                         ONLY TWO METERS WIDE. IT'S A SMALL
                         THERMAL EXHAUST PORT, RIGHT BELOW
                         THE MAIN PORT. THE SHAFT LEADS
                         DIRECTLY TO THE REACTOR SYSTEM. A
                         PRECISE HIT WILL START A CHAIN
                         REACTION WHICH SHOULD DESTROY THE
                         STATION.

               A MURMER OF DISBELIEF RUNS THROUGH THE ROOM.

                                     DODONNA
                         ONLY A PRECISE HIT WILL SET UP A
                         CHAIN REACTION. THE SHAFT IS RAY-
                         SHIELDED, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO USE PROTON
                         TORPEDOES.

               LUKE IS SITTING NEXT TO WEDGE ANTILLES, A HOTSHOT PILOT ABOUT
               SIXTEEN YEARS OLD.

                                     WEDGE
                         THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, EVEN FOR A
                         COMPUTER.

                                     LUKE
                         IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE. I USED TO BULL'S-
                         EYE WOMP RATS IN MY T-SIXTEEN BACK
                         HOME. THEY'RE NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN
                         TWO METERS.

                                     DODONNA
                         MAN YOUR SHIPS! AND MAY THE FORCE BE
                         WITH YOU!

               THE GROUP RISES AND BEGINS TO LEAVE.

               EXT. SPACE

               THE DEATH STAR BEGINS TO MOVE AROUND THE PLANET TOWARD THE
               TINY GREEN MOON.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               TARKIN AND VADER WATCH THE COMPUTER PROJECTED SCREEN WITH
               INTEREST, AS A CIRCLE OF LIGHTS INTERTWINES AROUND ONE ANOTHER
               ON THE SCREEN SHOWING IT'S POSITION IN RELATION TO YAVIN AND
               THE FORTH MOON.

               DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

               ORBITING THE PLANET AT MAXIMUM VELOCITY. THE MOON WITH THE
               REBEL BASE WILL BE IN RANGE IN THIRTY MINUTES.

                                     VADER
                         THIS WILL BE A DAY LONG REMEMBERED.
                         IT HAS SEEN THE END OF KENOBI AND IT
                         WILL SOON SEE THE END OF THE
                         REBELLION.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK

               LUKE, THREEPIO AND LITTLE ARTOO ENTER THE HUGE SPACESHIP
               HANGAR AND HURRY ALONG A LONG LINE OF GLEAMING SPACEFIGHTERS.
               FLIGHT CREWS RUSH AROUND LOADING LAST-MINUTE ARMAMENTS AND
               UNLOCKING POWER COUPLINGS. IN AN AREA ISOLATED FROM THIS
               ACTIVITY LUKE FINDS HAN AND CHEWBACCA LOADING SMALL BOXES
               ONTO AN ARMORED SPEEDER.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                              (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
                         ALL FLIGHT TROOPER, MAN YOUR STATIONS.
                         ALL FLIGHT TROOPS, MAN YOUR STATIONS.

               HAN IS DELIBERATELY IGNORING THE ACTIVITY OF THE FIGHTER
               PILOTS' PREPARATION. LUKE IS QUITE SADDENED AT THE SIGHT OF
               HIS FRIEND'S DEPARTURE.

                                     LUKE
                         SO... YOU GOT YOUR REWARD AND YOU'RE
                         JUST LEAVING THEN?

                                     HAN
                         THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH! I GOT SOME OLD
                         DEBTS I'VE GOT TO PAY OFF WITH THIS
                         STUFF. EVEN IF I DIDN'T, YOU DON'T
                         THINK I'D BE FOOL ENOUGH TO STICK
                         AROUND HERE, DO YOU? WHY DON'T YOU
                         COME WITH US? YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD IN
                         A FIGHT. I COULD USE YOU.

                                     LUKE
                              (GETTING ANGRY)
                         COME ON! WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A LOOK
                         AROUND? YOU KNOW WHAT'S ABOUT TO
                         HAPPEN, WHAT THEY'RE UP AGAINST.
                         THEY COULD USE A GOOD PILOT LIKE
                         YOU. YOU'RE TURNING YOUR BACK ON
                         THEM.

                                     HAN
                         WHAT GOOD'S A REWARD IF YOU AIN'T
                         AROUND TO USE IT? BESIDES, ATTACKING
                         THAT BATTLE STATION AIN'T MY IDEA OF
                         COURAGE. IT'S MORE LIKE SUICIDE.

                                     LUKE
                         ALL RIGHT. WELL, TAKE CARE OF
                         YOURSELF, HAN. I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
                         YOU'RE BEST AT, ISN'T IT?

               LUKE GOES OFF AND HAN HESITATES, THEN CALLS TO HIM.

                                     HAN
                         HEY, LUKE... MAY THE FORCE BE WITH
                         YOU!

               LUKE TURNS AND SEES HAN WINK AT HIM. LUKE LIFTS HIS HAND IN
               A SMALL WAVE AND THEN GOES OFF.

               HAN TURNS TO CHEWIE WHO GROWLS AT HIS CAPTAIN,

                                     HAN
                         WHAT'RE YOU LOOKIN' AT? I KNOW WHAT
                         I'M DOING.

               INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP

               LUKE, LEIA, AND DODONNA MEET UNDER A HUGE SPACE FIGHTER.

                                     LEIA
                         WHAT'S WRONG?

                                     LUKE
                         OH, IT'S HAN! I DON'T KNOW, I REALLY
                         THOUGHT HE'D CHANGE HIS MIND.

                                     LEIA
                         HE'S GOT TO FOLLOW HIS OWN PATH. NO
                         ONE CAN CHOOSE IT FOR HIM.

                                     LUKE
                         I ONLY WISH BEN WERE HERE.

               LEIA GIVES LUKE A LITTLE KISS, TURNS, AND GOES OFF. AS LUKE
               HEADS FOR HIS SHIP, ANOTHER PILOT RUSHES UP TO HIM AND GRABS
               HIS ARM.

                                     BIGGS
                         LUKE! I DON'T BELIEVE IT! HOW'D YOU
                         GET HERE... ARE YOU GOING OUT WITH
                         US?!

                                     LUKE
                         BIGGS! OF COURSE, I'LL BE UP THERE
                         WITH YOU! LISTEN, HAVE I GOT SOME
                         STORIES TO TELL...

               RED LEADER, A RUGGED HANDSOME MAN IN HIS FORTIES, COMES UP
               BEHIND LUKE AND BIGGS. HE HAS THE CONFIDENT SMILE OF A BORN
               LEADER.

                                     RED LEADER
                         ARE YOU... LUKE SKYWALKER? HAVE YOU
                         BEEN CHECKED OUT ON THE INCOM T-SIXTY-
                         FIVE?

                                     BIGGS
                         SIR, LUKE IS THE BEST BUSHPILOT IN
                         THE OUTER RIM TERRITORIES.

               RED LEADER PATS LUKE ON THE BACK AS THEY STOP IN FRONT OF
               HIS FIGHTER.

                                     RED LEADER
                         I MET YOUR FATHER ONCE WHEN I WAS
                         JUST A BOY, HE WAS A GREAT PILOT.
                         YOU'LL DO ALL RIGHT. IF YOU'VE GOT
                         HALF OF YOUR FATHER'S SKILL, YOU'LL
                         DO BETTER THAN ALL RIGHT.

                                     LUKE
                         THANK YOU, SIR. I'LL TRY.

               RED LEADER HURRIES TO HIS OWN SHIP.

                                     BIGGS
                         I'VE GOT TO GET ABOARD. LISTEN, YOU'LL
                         TELL ME YOUR STORIES WHEN WE COME
                         BACK. ALL RIGHT?

                                     LUKE
                         I TOLD YOU I'D MAKE IT SOMEDAY, BIGGS.

                                     BIGGS
                              (GOING OFF)
                         YOU DID, ALL RIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE
                         LIKE OLD TIMES, LUKE. WE'RE A COUPLE
                         OF SHOOTING STARS THAT'LL NEVER BE
                         STOPPED!

               LUKE LAUGHS AND SHAKES HIS HEAD IN AGREEMENT. HE HEADS FOR
               HIS SHIP.

               AS LUKE BEGINS TO CLIMB UP THE LADDER INTO HIS SLEEK, DEADLY
               SPACESHIP, THE CREW CHIEF, WHO IS WORKING ON THE CRAFT, POINTS
               TO LITTLE ARTOO, WHO IS BEING HOISTED INTO A SOCKET ON THE
               BACK OF THE FIGHTER.

                                     CHIEF
                         THIS R2 UNIT OF YOUR SEEMS A BIT
                         BEAT UP. DO YOU WANT A NEW ONE?

                                     LUKE
                         NOT ON YOUR LIFE! THAT LITTLE DROID
                         AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
                         TOGETHER.
                              (TO ARTOO)
                         YOU OKAY, ARTOO?

               THE CREWMEN LOWER ARTOO-DETOO INTO THE CRAFT. NOW A PART OF
               THE EXTERIOR SHELL OF THE STARSHIP, THE LITTLE DROID BEEPS
               THAT HE IS FINE.

               LUKE CLIMBS UP INTO THE COCKPIT OF HIS FIGHTER AND PUTS AN
               HIS HELMET. THREEPIO LOOKS ON FROM THE FLOOR OF THE MASSIVE
               HANGAR AS THE CREWMEN SECURE HIS LITTLE ELECTRONIC PARTNER
               INTO LUKE'S X-WING. IT'S AN EMOTIONAL-FILLED MOMENT AS ARTOO
               BEEPS GOOD-BYE.

                                     CHIEF
                         OKAY, EASY SHE GOES!

                                     THREEPIO
                         HANG ON TIGHT,ARTOO, YOU'VE GOT TO
                         COME BACK.

               ARTOO BEEPS IN AGREEMENT.

                                     THREEPIO
                         YOU WOULDN'T WANT MY LIFE TO GET
                         BORING, WOULD YOU?

               ARTOO WHISTLES HIS REPLY.

               ALL FINAL PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE APPROACHING BATTLE.
               THE HANGAR IS BUZZING WITH THE LAST MINUTE ACTIVITY AS THE
               PILOTS AND CREWMEN ALIKE MAKE THEIR FINAL ADJUSTMENTS. THE
               HUM OF ACTIVITY IS OCCASIONALLY TRESPASSED BY THE DISTORTED
               VOICE OF THE LOUDSPEAKER ISSUING COMMANDS. COUPLING HOSES
               ARE DISCONNECTED FROM THE SHIPS AS THEY ARE FUELED. COCKPIT
               SHIELDS ROLL SMOOTHLY INTO PLACE OVER EACH PILOT. A SIGNALMAN,
               HOLDING RED GUIDING LIGHTS, DIRECTS THE SHIPS. LUKE, A TRACE
               OF A SMILE GRACING HIS LIPS, PEERS ABOUT THROUGH HIS GOGGLES.

EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH

A STAR DESTROYER MOVES THROUGH SPACE, RELEASING IMPERIAL PROBE ROBOTS
FROM ITS UNDERSIDE.

ONE OF THESE PROBES ZOOMS TOWARD THE PLANET HOTH AND LANDS ON ITS ICE-
COVERED SURFACE.  AN EXPLOSION MARKS THE POINT OF
IMPACT.

EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

A WEIRD MECHANICAL SOUND RISES ABOVE THE WHINING OF THE WIND.  A
STRANGE PROBE ROBOT, WITH SEVERAL EXTENDED SENSORS, EMERGES FROM THE
SMOKE-SHROUDED CRATER.  THE OMINOUS MECHANICAL PROBE FLOATS ACROSS THE
SNOW PLAIN AND DISAPPEARS INTO THE DISTANCE.

EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY

A SMALL FIGURE GALLOPS ACROSS THE WINDSWEPT ICE SLOPE.  THE BUNDLED
RIDER IS MOUNTED ON A LARGE GRAY SNOW LIZARD, A TAUNTAUN.  CURVING
PLUMES OF SNOW RISE FROM BENEATH THE SPEEDING PAWS OF THE TWO-LEGGED
BEAST.

THE RIDER GALLOPS UP A SLOPE AND REINS HIS LIZARD TO A STOP.  PULLING
OFF HIS PROTECTIVE GOGGLES, LUKE SKYWALKER NOTICES SOMETHING IN THE
SKY.  HE TAKES A PAIR OF ELECTROBINOCULARS FROM HIS UTILITY BELT AND
THROUGH THEM SEES SMOKE RISING FROM WHERE THE PROBE ROBOT HAS CRASHED.

THE WIND WHIPS AT LUKE'S FUR-LINED CAP AND HE ACTIVATES A COMLINK
TRANSMITTER.  HIS TAUNTAUN SHIFTS AND MOANS NERVOUSLY BENEATH HIM.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		ECHO THREE TO ECHO SEVEN.  HAN,
		OLD BUDDY, DO YOU READ ME?

AFTER A LITTLE STATIC A FAMILIAR VOICE IS HEARD.

				HAN
			(OVER COMLINK)
		LOUD AND CLEAR, KID.  WHAT'S UP?

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		WELL, I FINISHED MY CIRCLE.  I
		DON'T PICK UP ANY LIFE READINGS.

				HAN
			(OVER COMLINK)
		THERE ISN'T ENOUGH LIFE ON THIS
		ICE CUBE TO FILL A SPACE CRUISER.
		THE SENSORS ARE PLACED, I'M GOING
		BACK.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		RIGHT.  I'LL SEE YOU SHORTLY.
		THERE'S A METEORITE THAT HIT THE
		GROUND NEAR HERE.  I WANT TO CHECK
		IT OUT.  IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

LUKE CLICKS OFF HIS TRANSMITTER AND REINS BACK ON HIS NERVOUS LIZARD.
HE PATS THE BEAST ON THE HEAD TO CALM IT.

				LUKE
		HEY, STEADY GIRL.  WHAT'S THE
		MATTER?  YOU SMELL SOMETHING?

LUKE TAKES A SMALL DEVICE FROM HIS BELT AND STARTS TO ADJUST IT WHEN
SUDDENLY A LARGE SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM FROM BEHIND.  HE HEARS A
MONSTROUS HOWL AND TURNS TO SEE AN ELEVEN-FOOT-TALL SHAPE TOWERING OVER
HIM.  IT IS A WAMPA ICE CREATURE, LUNGING AT HIM FEROCIOUSLY.

				LUKE
		AAARGH!

LUKE GRABS FOR HIS PISTOL, BUT IS HIT FLAT IN THE FACE BY A HUGE WHITE
CLAW.  HE FALLS UNCONSCIOUS INTO THE SNOW AND IN A MOMENT THE TERRIFIED
SCREAMS OF THE TAUNTAUN ARE CUT SHORT BY THE HORRIBLE SNAP OF A NECK
BEING BROKEN.

THE WAMPA ICE CREATURE GRABS LUKE BY ONE ANKLE AND DRAGS HIM AWAY
ACROSS THE FROZEN PLAIN.

EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY

A STALWART FIGURE RIDES HIS TAUNTAUN UP TO THE ENTRANCE OF AN ENORMOUS
ICE CAVE.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

REBEL TROOPERS RUSH ABOUT UNLOADING SUPPLIES AND OTHERWISE SECURING
THEIR NEW BASE.  THE RIDER, HAN SOLO, SWINGS OFF HIS LIZARD AND PULLS
OFF HIS GOGGLES.

HE WALKS INTO THE MAIN HANGAR DECK TOWARD THE MILLENNIUM FALCON, WHICH
IS PARKED AMONG SEVERAL FIGHTERS.  MECHANICS, R2 UNITS, AND VARIOUS
OTHER DROIDS HURRY ABOUT.  HAN STOPS AT THE MILLENNIUM FALCON WHERE HIS
WOOKIEE COPILOT, CHEWBACCA, IS WELDING ON A CENTRAL LIFTER.  CHEWIE
STOPS HIS WORK AND LIFTS HIS FACE SHIELD, GROWLING AN IRRITATED
GREETING TO HIS BOSS.

				HAN
		CHEWIE!

THE WOOKIEE GRUMBLES A REPLY.

				HAN
		ALL RIGHT, DON'T LOSE YOUR TEMPER.
		I'LL COME RIGHT BACK AND GIVE YOU
		A HAND.

CHEWBACCA PUTS HIS MASK BACK ON AND RETURNS TO HIS WELDING AS HAN
LEAVES.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

A MAKESHIFT COMMAND CENTER HAS BEEN SET UP IN A BLASTED AREA OF THICK
ICE.  THE LOW-CEILINGED ROOM IS A BEEHIVE OF ACTIVITY. CONTROLLERS,
TROOPS, AND DROIDS MOVE ABOUT SETTING UP ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AND
MONITORING RADAR SIGNALS.

GENERAL RIEEKAN STRAIGHTENS UP FROM A CONSOLE AT HAN'S APPROACH.

				RIEEKAN
		SOLO?

				HAN
NO SIGN OF LIFE OUT THERE, GENERAL.
THE SENSORS ARE IN PLACE.  YOU'LL
KNOW IF ANYTHING COMES AROUND.

				RIEEKAN
		COMMANDER SKYWALKER REPORTED IN YET?

				HAN
		NO.  HE'S CHECKING OUT A METEORITE
		THAT HIT NEAR HIM.

				RIEEKAN
			(INDICATES RADAR
			 SCREEN)
		WITH ALL THE METEOR ACTIVITY IN THIS
		SYSTEM, IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT
		TO SPOT APPROACHING SHIPS.

TAKING A DEEP BREATH, HAN BLURTS OUT WHAT IS ON HIS MIND.

				HAN
		GENERAL, I'VE GOT TO LEAVE.  I
		CAN'T STAY ANYMORE.

PRINCESS LEIA, STANDING AT A CONSOLE NEARBY, IS DRESSED IN A SHORT
WHITE COMBAT JACKET AND PANTS.  HER HAIR IS BRAIDED ACROSS HER HEAD IN
A NORDIC FASHION.  SHE OVERHEARS THEIR  CONVERSATION AND SEEMS SOMEWHAT
DISTRESSED.

				RIEEKAN
		I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

				HAN
		WELL, THERE'S A PRICE ON MY HEAD.
		IF I DON'T PAY OFF JABBA THE HUT,
		I'M A DEAD MAN.

				RIEEKAN
		A DEATH MARK'S NOT AN EASY THING
		TO LIVE WITH.  YOU'RE A GOOD
		FIGHTER, SOLO.  I HATE TO LOSE YOU.

				HAN
		THANK YOU, GENERAL.

HE TURNS TO LEIA AS RIEEKAN MOVES AWAY.

				HAN
			(WITH FEELING)
		WELL, YOUR HIGHNESS, I GUESS THIS
		IS IT.

				LEIA
		THAT'S RIGHT.

LEIA IS ANGRY.  HAN SEES SHE HAS NO WARMTH TO OFFER HIM.  HE SHAKES HIS
HEAD AND ADOPTS A SARCASTIC TONE.

				HAN
			(COOLY)
		WELL, DON'T GET ALL MUSHY ON ME.
		SO LONG, PRINCESS.

HAN WALKS AWAY INTO THE QUIET CORRIDOR ADJOINING THE COMMAND CENTER.
LEIA STEWS A MOMENT, THEN HURRIES AFTER HIM.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

				LEIA
		HAN!

HAN STOPS IN THE CORRIDOR AND TURNS TO FACE LEIA.

				HAN
		YES, YOUR HIGHNESSNESS?

				LEIA
		I THOUGHT YOU DECIDED TO STAY.

				HAN
		WELL, THE BOUNTY HUNTER WE RAN
		INTO ON ORD MANTELL CHANGED MY
		MIND.

				LEIA
		HAN, WE NEED YOU!

				HAN
		WE?

				LEIA
		YES.

				HAN
		OH, WHAT ABOUT YOU NEED?

				LEIA
			(MYSTIFIED)
		I NEED?  I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
		TALKING ABOUT.

				HAN
			(SHAKES HIS HEAD,
			 FED UP)
		YOU PROBABLY DON'T.

				LEIA
		AND WHAT PRECISELY AM I SUPPOSED
		TO KNOW?

				HAN
		COME ON!  YOU WANT ME TO STAY
		BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT
		ME.

				LEIA
		YES.  YOU'RE A GREAT HELP TO US.
		YOU'RE A NATURAL LEADER...

				HAN
		NO!  THAT'S NOT IT.  COME ON.
		AAHHH - UH HUH!  COME ON.

LEIA STARES AT HIM, UNDERSTANDING, THEN LAUGHS.

				LEIA
YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS.

				HAN
		AM I?  THEN WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING
		ME?  AFRAID I WAS GOING TO LEAVE
		WITHOUT GIVING YOU A GOODBYE KISS?

				LEIA
		I'D JUST AS SOON KISS A WOOKIEE.

				HAN
		I CAN ARRANGE THAT.  YOU COULD USE
		A GOOD KISS!

ANGRILY, HAN STRIDES DOWN THE CORRIDOR AS LEIA STARES AFTER HIM.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR

A FAMILIAR STREAM OF BEEPS AND WHISTLES HERALD THE APPROACH OF ARTOO-
DETOO AND SEE-THREEPIO, WHO APPEAR AROUND A CORNER AND MOVE ALONG AN
ICE WALL TOWARD THE MAIN HANGAR.

				THREEPIO
		DON'T TRY TO BLAME ME.  I DIDN'T
		ASK YOU TO TURN ON THE THERMAL
		HEATER.  I MERELY COMMENTED THAT IT
		WAS FREEZING IN THE PRINCESS'
		CHAMBER.  BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
		FREEZING.  HOW ARE WE GOING TO DRY
		OUT ALL HER CLOTHES?  I REALLY DON'T
		KNOW.

ARTOO BEEPS A STREAM OF PROTESTING WHISTLES.

				THREEPIO
		OH, SWITCH OFF.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

THE TWO ROBOTS STOP AT HAN SOLO'S SPACE FREIGHTER.  HAN AND CHEWIE ARE
STRUGGLING WITH THEIR CENTRAL LIFTERS.

				HAN
			(TO CHEWIE)
		WHY DO YOU TAKE THIS APART NOW?
		I'M TRYING TO GET US OUT OF HERE
		AND YOU PULL BOTH OF THESE.

CHEWIE GRUMBLES IN IRRITATION.

				THREEPIO
		EXCUSE ME, SIR.

				HAN
			(TO CHEWIE)
		PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.

				THREEPIO
		MIGHT I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU,
		PLEASE?

				HAN
		WHAT DO YOU WANT?

				THREEPIO
		WELL, IT'S PRINCESS LEIA, SIR.
		SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU ON
		THE COMMUNICATOR.

				HAN
		I TURNED IT OFF.  I DON'T WANT TO
		TALK TO HER.

				THREEPIO
		OH.  WELL, PRINCESS LEIA IS WONDERING
		ABOUT MASTER LUKE.  HE HASN'T COME
		BACK YET.  SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE
		IS.

				HAN
		I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

				THREEPIO
		NOBODY KNOWS WHERE HE IS.

				HAN
		WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NOBODY KNOWS"?

HAN GLANCES AT THE FADING LIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE ICE CAVE AS
NIGHT SLOWLY BEGINS TO FALL ON THE PLANET.

				THREEPIO
		WELL, UH, YOU SEE...

HAN JUMPS DOWN OFF THE LIFT, AS THREEPIO FOLLOWS HIM.

				HAN
		DECK OFFICER.  DECK OFFICER!

				THREEPIO
		EXCUSE ME, SIR.  MIGHT I INQU...

HAN ABRUPTLY PUTS HIS HAND OVER THREEPIO'S MOUTH AS THE DECK OFFICER
APPROACHES.

				DECK OFFICER
		YES, SIR?

				HAN
		DO YOU KNOW WHERE COMMANDER
		SKYWALKER IS?

				DECK OFFICER
		I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.  IT'S POSSIBLE
		HE CAME IN THROUGH THE SOUTH ENTRANCE.

				HAN
		IT'S POSSIBLE?  WHY DON'T YOU GO
		FIND OUT?  IT'S GETTING DARK OUT THERE.

				DECK OFFICER
		YES, SIR.

THE DECK OFFICER LEAVES HURRIEDLY, AS HAN TAKES HIS HAND OFF THREEPIO'S
MOUTH.

				THREEPIO
		EXCUSE ME, SIR.  MIGHT I INQUIRE
		WHAT'S GOING ON?

				HAN
		WHY NOT?

				THREEPIO
		IMPOSSIBLE MAN.  COME ALONG, ARTOO,
		LET'S FIND PRINCESS LEIA.  BETWEEN
		OURSELVES, I THINK MASTER LUKE IS
		IN CONSIDERABLE DANGER.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL

THE DECK OFFICER AND HIS ASSISTANT HURRY TOWARD HAN AS HE ENTERS THE
TUNNEL.

				DECK OFFICER
		SIR, COMMANDER SKYWALKER HASN'T
		COME IN THROUGH THE SOUTH ENTRANCE.
		HE MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN TO CHECK IN.

				HAN
		NOT LIKELY.  ARE THE SPEEDERS READY?

				DECK OFFICER
		NOT YET.  WE'RE HAVING SOME TROUBLE
		ADAPTING THEM TO THE COLD.

				HAN
		THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GO OUT ON
		TAUNTAUNS.

				DECK OFFICER
		SIR, THE TEMPERATURE'S DROPPING TOO
		RAPIDLY.

				HAN
		THAT'S RIGHT.  AND MY FRIENDS OUT
		IN IT.

				ASSISTANT OFFICER
		I'LL COVER SECTOR TWELVE.  HAVE
		COM-CONTROL SET SCREEN ALPHA.

HAN PUSHES THROUGH THE TROOPS AND MOUNTS A TAUNTAUN.

				DECK OFFICER
		YOUR TAUNTAUN'LL FREEZE BEFORE YOU
		REACH THE FIRST MARKER.

				HAN
		THEN I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL!

HAN MANEUVERS HIS MOUNT OUT OF THE CAVE AND RACES INTO THE DARK BITTER
NIGHT.

EXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK

THE JAGGED FACE OF A HUGE ICE WALL SITS GLOOMILY IN THE DIM TWILIGHT OF
A HOTH DAY.  LUKE HANGS UPSIDE DOWN, ANKLES FROZEN INTO ICY
STALACTITES, HIS EXTENDED ARMS WITHIN A FOOT OF THE SNOW FLOOR.  ONE
SIDE OF HIS FACE IS COVERED IN A DRIED MASK OF FROZEN BLOOD.  HE OPENS
HIS EYES AS A CHILLING MOAN OF THE HIDEOUS ICE CREATURE ECHOES OFF THE
GORGE WALLS.  LUKE PULLS HIMSELF UP, GRABS HOLD OF HIS ANKLES, AND
FUTILELY TRIES TO UNFASTEN THE THRONGS.

EXHAUSTED, HE DROPS BACK INTO HIS HANGING POSITION.  AS HE HANGS THERE,
HE SPIES HIS LIGHTSABER LYING NEAR A PILE OF HIS DISCARDED GEAR, ABOUT
THREE FEET OUT OF REACH.

HE FOCUSES ON THE SABER AND, AS HIS HAND STRAINS TOWARD THE WEAPON, HE
SQUEEZES HIS EYES TIGHT IN CONCENTRATION.

JUST AS THE ICE CREATURE LOOMS OVER LUKE, THE LIGHTSABER JUMPS INTO
LUKE'S HAND.

THE YOUNG WARRIOR INSTANTLY IGNITES HIS SWORD, SWINGING UP, AND CUTS
HIMSELF LOOSE FROM THE ICE.  HE FLOPS TO THE SNOW IN A HEAP.  THE
STARTLED CREATURE MOVES BACK, HIS GIANT YELLOW EYES BLINKING.  LUKE
SCRAMBLES TO HIS FEET.  HE SWINGS HIS LIGHTSABER AND THE BEAST SCREAMS
IN PAIN.

EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK

LUKE STAGGERS OUT OF THE GORGE INTO THE DARK AND SNOWY TWILIGHT.  WEAK
AND EXHAUSTED, HE STUMBLES DOWN A SNOW BANK.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK

A SMALL, LONE FIGURE RIDING A TAUNTAUN RACES THROUGH THE HOSTILE
VASTNESS OF SNOW AND COLD.  AS IT RUNS, THE TAUNTAUN'S LEGS KICK UP
LARGE CLOUDS OF SNOW AND ICE INTO THE SNOWY AIR.

EXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE				 HANGAR - DUSK

ARTOO STANDS IN THE FALLING SNOW, BEEPING WORRIEDLY.  THREEPIO MOVES
STIFFLY OVER TO HIM.

				THREEPIO
		YOU MUST COME ALONG NOW, ARTOO.
		THERE'S REALLY NOTHING MORE WE CAN
		DO.  AND MY JOINTS ARE FREEZING UP.

ARTOO BEEPS, LONG AND LOW.

				THREEPIO
		DON'T SAY THING LIKE THAT!  OF
		COURSE WE'LL SEE MASTER LUKE AGAIN.
		HE'LL BE QUITE ALL RIGHT, YOU'LL SEE.
			(TO HIMSELF)
		STUPID LITTLE SHORT-CIRCUIT.  HE'LL
		BE QUITE ALL RIGHT.

THREEPIO TURNS TO GO BACK INSIDE THE MAIN HANGAR AS ARTOO MOURNFULLY
KEEPS HIS VIGIL.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

THE WIND IS BLOWING QUITE STRONG NOW.  LUKE STRUGGLES TO STAY UPRIGHT,
BUT A BLAST OF FREEZING SNOW KNOCKS HIM OVER.  HE STRUGGLES TO GET UP,
BUT HE CAN'T.  THE YOUNG WARRIOR FROM TATOOINE DRAGS HIMSELF A COUPLE
OF FEET AND THEN COLLAPSES.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

PRINCESS LEIA STANDS INSIDE THE DARK ENTRANCE TO THE REBEL BASE,
WAITING FOR A SIGN OF THE TWO REBEL HEROES.  SHE SHIVERS IN THE COLD
WIND AS, NEARBY, CHEWIE SITS WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS.  IN THE
BACKGROUND, ARTOO AND THREEPIO MOVE THROUGH THE DOORS.

A REBEL LIEUTENANT MOVES TO MAJOR DERLIN, AN OFFICER KEEPING WATCH WITH
THE PRINCESS.

				LIEUTENANT
		SIR, ALL THE PATROLS ARE IN.
		THERE'S STILL NO CONTACT FROM
		SKYWALKER OR SOLO.

				THREEPIO
		MISTRESS LEIA, ARTOO SAYS HE'S BEEN
		QUITE UNABLE TO PICK UP ANY SIGNALS,
		ALTHOUGH HE DOES ADMIT THAT HIS OWN
		RANGE IS FAR TOO WEAK TO ABANDON
		ALL HOPE.

LEIA NODS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT, BUT SHE IS LOST IN THOUGHT.

				DERLIN
		YOUR HIGHNESS, THERE'S NOTHING
		MORE WE CAN DO TONIGHT.  THE SHIELD
		DOORS MUST BE CLOSED.

HE TURNS TO THE LIEUTENANT.

				DERLIN
		CLOSE THE DOORS.

				LIEUTENANT
		YES, SIR.

THE LIEUTENANT WALKS AWAY.  CHEWIE LETS OUT A LONG, MOURNFUL HOWL,
SOMEWHAT LIKE A COYOTE.  AT THE SAME MOMENT, ARTOO BEGINS A COMPLEX
SERIES OF EFFICIENT BEEPS.

				THREEPIO
		ARTOO SAYS THE CHANCES OF SURVIVAL
		ARE SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE...
		TO ONE.

LEIA STANDS PRAYING TO HERSELF AS THE HUGE METAL DOORS SLAM ACROSS THE
ENTRANCE OF THE ICE CAVE.  THE LOUD BOOMS ECHO THROUGHOUT THE HUGE
CAVERN.  CHEWIE LETS OUT ANOTHER SUFFERING HOWL.

				THREEPIO
		ACTUALLY, ARTOO HAS BEEN KNOWN TO
		MAKE MISTAKES... FROM TIME TO TIME.
		OH, DEAR, OH, DEAR.  DON'T WORRY
		ABOUT MASTER LUKE.  I'M SURE HE'LL
		BE ALL RIGHT.  HE'S QUITE CLEVER,
		YOU KNOW... FOR A HUMAN BEING.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

LUKE LIES FACE DOWN IN THE SNOW, NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS.  SLOWLY HE LOOKS
UP AND SEES BEN KENOBI, BARELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE BLOWING SNOW.  IT IS
HARD TO TELL IF KENOBI IS REAL OR A HALLUCINATION.

				BEN
		LUKE... LUKE.

				LUKE
			(WEAKLY)
		BEN?

				BEN
		YOU WILL GO TO THE DAGOBAH SYSTEM.

				LUKE
		DAGOBAH SYSTEM?

				BEN
		THERE YOU WILL LEARN FROM YODA,
		THE JEDI MASTER WHO INSTRUCTED ME.

THE IMAGE OF BEN FADES, REVEALING A LONE TAUNTAUN RIDER APPROACHING
FROM THE WINDSWEPT HORIZON.

				LUKE
			(GROANING FAINTLY)
		BEN... BEN.

LUKE DROPS INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS.

HAN PULLS UP AND LEAPS OFF HIS MOUNT.  HE HURRIES TO HIS SNOW-COVERED
FRIEND, CRADLING HIM IN HIS ARMS.  HAN'S TAUNTAUN LETS OUT A LOW,
PITIFUL BELLOW.  BUT HAN'S CONCERN IS WITH LUKE, AND HE SHAKES HIM
URGENTLY.

				HAN
		LUKE!  LUKE!  DON'T DO THIS, LUKE.
		COME ON, GIVE ME A SIGN HERE.

LUKE DOESN'T RESPOND.  HAN BEGINS FRANTICALLY RUBBING AND SLAPPING
LUKE'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE.  AS HE STARTS TO LIFT THE YOUTH, HAN HEARS A
RASPING SOUND BEHIND HIM.  HE TURNS, JUST IN TIME TO SEE HIS TAUNTAUN
STAGGER AND THEN FALL OVER INTO THE SNOW.

HAN CARRIES LUKE TO THE MOANING BEAST.  THEN, WITH A FINAL GROAN, THE
TAUNTAUN EXPIRES.

				HAN
		NOT MUCH TIME.

HE PUSHES LUKE'S INERT FORM AGAINST THE BELLY OF THE DEAD BEAST.

				LUKE
			(MOANING)
		BEN... BEN...

				HAN
		HANG ON, KID.

				LUKE
		DAGOBAH SYSTEM...

HAN IGNITES LUKE'S SABER AND CUTS THE BEAST FROM HEAD TO TOE.  HE
QUICKLY TOSSES IT'S STEAMING INNARDS INTO THE SNOW, THEN LIFTS LUKE'S
INERT FORM AND STUFFS HIM INSIDE THE CARCASS.

				HAN
			(REELING FROM THE
			 ODOR)
		WHEW...

				LUKE
		DAGOBAH...

				HAN
		THIS MAY SMELL BAD, KID...

				LUKE
			(MOANING)
		YODA...

				HAN
		...BUT IT WILL KEEP YOU WARM...
		TIL I GET THE SHELTER BUILT.
			(STRUGGLING TO GET
			 LUKE INSIDE THE
			 CARCASS)
		OOH... I THOUGHT THEY SMELLED BAD
		ON THE OUTSIDE!

THE WIND HAS PICKED UP CONSIDERABLY, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO MOVE.  HAN
REMOVES A PACK FROM THE DEAD CREATURE'S BACK, TAKING OUT A SHELTER
CONTAINER.  HE BEGINS TO SET UP WHAT CAN ONLY BE A PITIFUL PROTECTION
AGAINST A BITTER HOTH NIGHT.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWN

FOUR SNUB-NOSED ARMORED SNOWSPEEDERS RACE ACROSS THE WHITE LANDSCAPE.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT

THERE IS ONLY ONE PILOT, ZEV, IN THE ENCLOSED TWO-MAN CRAFT.  HE
CONCENTRATES ON THE SCOPES WHICH RING HIS COCKPIT.  HE HEARS A LOW BEEP
FROM ONE OF HIS MONITORS.

				ZEV
			(INTO TRANSMITTER)
		ECHO BASE... I'VE GOT SOMETHING!  NOT
		MUCH, BUT IT COULD BE A LIFE FORM.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT

THE SMALL CRAFT BANKS AND MAKES A SLOW ARC, THEN RACES OFF IN A NEW
DIRECTION.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT

THE PILOT SWITCHES OVER TO A NEW TRANSMITTER.

				ZEV
			(INTO TRANSMITTER)
		THIS IS ROGUE TWO.  THIS IS ROGUE
		TWO.  CAPTAIN SOLO, SO YOU COPY?
		COMMANDER SKYWALKER, DO YOU COPY?
		THIS IS ROGUE TWO.

THERE IS A SHARP CRACKLE OF STATIC, THEN A FAINT VOICE.

				HAN
			(FILTERED OVER
			 ZEV'S RECEIVER)
		GOOD MORNING.  NICE OF YOU GUYS
		TO DROP BY.

				ZEV
			(SWITCHING TRANSMITTERS)
		ECHO BASE... THIS IS ROGUE TWO.  I
		FOUND THEM.  REPEAT, I FOUND THEM.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAY

THE SMALL SHELTER HAN SET UP IS COVERED WITH SNOW ON THE WINDWARD SIDE.
A MAKESHIFT ANTENNA RESTS GINGERLY ON TOP THE SNOWDRIFT.  HAN SPOTS
ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER APPROACHING IN THE DISTANCE, AND BEGINS WAVING HIS
ARMS FRANTICALLY AT THE TINY CRAFT.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER

STRANGE ROBOT SURGEONS ADJUST A MASS OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT.  A SWITCH
IS THROWN AND A SUDDEN BLINDING FLASH OBSCURES LUKE IN A BACTA TANK
FILLED WITH A THICK, GELATINOUS SLIME.  HE BEGINS TO THRASH ABOUT,
RAVING IN DELIRIUM.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOM

LUKE SITS UP IN A RECOVERY-ROOM BED, WEAK BUT SMILING.  HIS FACE SHOWS
TERRIBLE WOUNDS FROM THE WAMPA'S ATTACK.  THREEPIO AND ARTOO ENTER THE
ROOM.

				THREEPIO
		MASTER LUKE, SIR, IT'S SO GOOD
		TO SEE YOU FULLY FUNCTIONAL AGAIN.

ARTOO BEEPS HIS GOOD WISHES.

				THREEPIO
		ARTOO EXPRESSES HIS RELIEF, ALSO.

HAN AND CHEWIE MAKE THEIR ENTRANCE.  THE WOOKIEE GROWLS A GREETING.

				HAN
		HOW ARE YOU FEELING, KID?  YOU
		DON'T LOOK SO BAD TO ME.  IN
		FACT, YOU LOOK STRONG ENOUGH TO
		PULL THE EARS OFF A GUNDARK.

				LUKE
		THANKS TO YOU.

				HAN
		THAT'S TWO YOU OWE ME, JUNIOR.

HAN TURNS AS LEIA ENTERS THE ROOM.  HE LOOKS AT HER WITH A BIG,
DEVILISH GRIN.

				HAN
		WELL YOUR WORSHIP, LOOKS LIKE
		YOU MANAGED TO KEEP ME AROUND FOR
		A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

				LEIA
			(HAUGHTILY)
		I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.  GENERAL
		RIEEKAN THINKS IT'S DANGEROUS FOR
		ANY SHIPS TO LEAVE THE SYSTEM UNTIL
		WE'VE ACTIVATED THE ENERGY SHIELD.

				HAN
		THAT'S A GOOD STORY.  I THINK YOU
		JUST CAN'T BEAR TO LET A GORGEOUS
		GUY LIKE ME OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

				LEIA
		I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GET YOUR
		DELUSIONS, LASER BRAIN.

CHEWIE IS AMUSED; HE LAUGHS IN HIS MANNER.  HAN, ENJOYING HIMSELF,
REGARDS CHEWIE GOOD-HUMOREDLY.

				HAN
		LAUGH IT UP, FUZZBALL.  BUT YOU
		DIDN'T SEE US ALONE IN THE SOUTH
		PASSAGE.

LUKE SPARKS TO THIS; HE LOOKS AT LEIA.

				HAN
		SHE EXPRESSED HER TRUE FEELINGS
		FOR ME.

LEIA IS FLUSHED, EYES DARTING BETWEEN LUKE AND HAN.

				LEIA
		MY...!  WHY, YOU STUCK UP,... HALF-
		WITTED... SCRUFFY-LOOKING ...NERF-
		HERDER!

				HAN
		WHO'S SCRUFFY-LOOKING?
			(TO LUKE)
		I MUST HAVE HIT PRETTY CLOSE TO
		THE MARK TO GET HER ALL RILED UP
		LIKE THAT, HUH, KID?

LEIA LOOKS VULNERABLE FOR A MOMENT, THEN THE MASK FALLS AGAIN, AND SHE
FOCUSES ON LUKE.

				LEIA
		WHY, I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW
		EVERYTHING ABOUT WOMEN YET?

WITH THAT SHE LEANS OVER AND KISSES LUKE ON THE LIPS.  THEN SHE TURNS
ON HER HEEL AND WALKS OUT, LEAVING EVERYONE IN THE ROOM SLIGHTLY
DUMBSTRUCK.  WITH SOME SMUGNESS, LUKE PUTS HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS HEAD
AND GRINS.

SUDDENLY, IN THE DISTANCE, THE MUFFLED SOUND OF AN ALARM IS HEARD.

				ANNOUNCER
			(OVER LOUDSPEAKER)
		HEADQUARTERS PERSONNEL, REPORT TO

THE VOICE REPEATS THE ORDER AND HAN, CHEWIE, ARTOO, AND THREEPIO HURRY
OUT OF THE ROOM, BIDDING FAREWELL TO LUKE.

		TAKE IT EASY.

				THREEPIO
		EXCUSE US, PLEASE.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

RIEEKAN LOOKS UP GRIMLY FROM A CONSOLE SCREEN.  HE CALLS OVER TO LEIA
AND HAN.

				RIEEKAN
		PRINCESS... WE HAVE A VISITOR.

THE GROUP HURRIES OVER TO RIEEKAN.

				RIEEKAN
		WE'VE PICKED UP SOMETHING OUTSIDE
		THE BASE IN ZONE TWELVE, MOVING
		EAST.

				SENIOR CONTROLLER
		IT'S METAL.

				LEIA
		THEN IT COULDN'T BE ONE OF THOSE
		CREATURES THAT ATTACKED LUKE.

				HAN
		IT COULD BE A SPEEDER, ONE OF OURS.

				SENIOR CONTROLLER
		NO.  WAIT - THERE'S SOMETHING VERY
		WEAK COMING THROUGH.

THREEPIO STEPS UP TO THE CONTROL PANEL AND LISTENS INTENTLY TO THE
STRANGE SIGNAL.

				THREEPIO
		SIR, I AM FLUENT IN SIX MILLION
		FORMS OF COMMUNICATION.  THIS SIGNAL
		IS NOT USED BY THE ALLIANCE.  IT
		COULD BE AN IMPERIAL CODE.

THE TRANSMISSION ENDS IN STATIC.

				HAN
		IT ISN'T FRIENDLY, WHATEVER IT IS.
		COME ON, CHEWIE, LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

				RIEEKAN
		SEND ROGUES TEN AND ELEVEN TO
		STATION THREE-EIGHT.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

THE DARK PROBE ROBOT MOVES PAST THE SMOLDERING RUINS OF STATION THREE-
EIGHT AND DOWN A RIDGE TOWARD THE REBEL BASE.  IT RAISES A LARGE
ANTENNA FROM THE TOP OF ITS HEAD AND BEGINS TO SEND OUT A PIERCING
SIGNAL.

THE PROBE DROID HAS SPOTTED CHEWBACCA WHO, NOT THIRTY FEET AWAY, HAS
POPPED HIS HEAD OVER A SNOW BANK.  INSTANTLY, THE PROBE ROBOT SWINGS
AROUND, ITS DEADLY RAY READY TO FIRE.  BUT BEFORE IT CAN GET A SHOT
OFF, IT IS HIT FROM BEHIND BY A LASER BOLT, AND EXPLODES IN A MILLION
PIECES.

HAN SOLO REPLACES HIS BLASTER IN ITS HOLSTER AND PEERS INTENTLY AT THE
SMOLDERING REMAINS OF THE IMPERIAL PROBE.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

LEIA AND RIEEKAN LISTEN TO HAN ON THE COMLINK.

			(OVER COMLINK)
		DROID OF SOME KIND.  I DIDN'T HIT

SPACECRAFT.  TIE FIGHTERS DART TO AND FRO.

INT. DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - MAIN CONTROL DECK

CONTROLLERS WORKING THE VAST COMPLEX OF ELECTRONIC CONTROLS HEAR

SQUAT, EVIL-LOOKING ADMIRAL OZZEL AND THE YOUNG, POWERFULLY BUILT
GENERAL VEERS, WHO HAVE BEEN CONFERRING NEAR THE FRONT, ALSO FEEL THE
APPROACHING PRESENCE AND TURN TOWARD IT.  DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE

CAPTAIN PIETT HURRIES UP TO OZZEL.

				PIETT
		ADMIRAL.

				OZZEL
		YES, CAPTAIN

				PIETT
		I THINK WE'VE GOT SOMETHING, SIR.

		IT COULD MEAN ANYTHING.  IF WE

VADER MOVES TO A LARGE SCREEN SHOWING AN IMAGE OF THE REBEL SNOW BASE.
REBEL SPEEDERS CAN BE SEEN APPROACHING THE BASE IN THE DISTANCE.

				VADER
		YOU FOUND SOMETHING?

				PIETT
		YES, MY LORD.

				VADER
			(STUDYING THE IMAGE

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

ALARMS SOUND.  TROOPS, GROUND CREWS, AND DROIDS RUSH TO THEIR ALERT
STATIONS.  ARMORED SNOWSPEEDERS ARE LINED UP IN ATTACK FORMATION NEAR
THE MAIN ENTRANCE.

IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS ACTIVITY, HAN DOES SOME FRANTIC WELDING ON THE
LIFTERS OF THE MILLENNIUM FALCON.

HAN FINISHES HIS WORK AND HOPS DOWN TO THE HANGAR FLOOR.  HE PULLS OUT
HIS COMLINK, ALL THE WHILE EYEING PROBLEMATIC LIFTERS.

				HAN
			(INTO COMLINK, TO
			 CHEWIE)
		OKAY, THAT'S IT.  TRY IT... OFF!
		TURN IT OFF!  TURN IT OFF!  OFF!

SMOKE RISES FROM A MINOR EXPLOSION ON THE LIFTER.  EXASPERATED, HAN
SURVEYS THE NEW DAMAGE.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER

LUKE DRESSES IN READINESS FOR THE EVACUATION AS HIS ATTENDING MEDICAL
DROID STANDS BY.

				MEDICAL DROID
		SIR, IT WILL TAKE QUITE A WHILE
		TO EVACUATE THE T-FORTY- SEVENS.

				LUKE
		WELL, FORGET THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT.
		THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME TO GET THE
		SMALLER MODULES ON THE TRANSPORTS.

				MEDICAL DROID
		TAKE CARE, SIR.

				LUKE
		THANKS.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

PILOTS, GUNNERS, AND R2 UNITS SCURRY ABOUT.  LUKE, PULLING ON HIS
HEAVY-WEATHER JACKET, IS HEADED TOWARD A ROW OF ARMORED SPEEDERS.  HE
STOPS AT THE REAR OF THE MILLENNIUM FALCON, WHERE HAN AND CHEWIE ARE
TRYING TO REPAIR THE RIGHT LIFTER WITH EVEN MORE HASTE THAN BEFORE.

				LUKE
		CHEWIE, TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
		OKAY?

AS LUKE PATS CHEWIE ON THE ARM, CHEWIE PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND LUKE AND
GIVES HIM A TIGHT HUG.  HAN IS DISCUSSING THE LIFTER WITH A REPAIR
DROID WHEN HE SEES LUKE.

				HAN
		HI, KID.
			(TO DROID)
		THERE'S GOT TO BE A REASON FOR
		IT.  CHECK IT AT THE OTHER END.
		WAIT A SECOND.
			(TO LUKE)
		YOU ALL RIGHT?

				LUKE
		YEAH.

				HAN
		BE CAREFUL.

				LUKE
		YOU, TOO.

LUKE SMILES, THEN WAVES AT HIS FRIEND AND WALKS ON.  AFTER A FEW STEPS,
HE STOPS AND LOOKS BACK.  HAN GLANCES UP AND THE TWO EXCHANGE A SILENT
COMMUNICATION, EACH WISHING THE OTHER SAFETY, HAPPINESS - MANY THINGS,
ALL DIFFICULT TO VERBALIZE.

INT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM.

ALARMS SOUND THROUGHOUT THE HIDDEN REBEL BASE.  IN THE CONTROL ROOM, A
CONTROLLER URGENTLY GESTURES FOR GENERAL RIEEKAN TO CHECK A COMPUTER
SCAN.

				CONTROLLER
		GENERAL, THERE'S A FLEET OF STAR
		DESTROYERS COMING OUT OF HYPERSPACE
		IN SECTOR FOUR.

				RIEEKAN
		REROUTE ALL POWER TO THE ENERGY
		SHIELD.  WE'VE GOT TO HOLD THEM TILL
		ALL TRANSPORTS ARE AWAY.  PREPARE
		FOR GROUND ASSAULT.

RIEEKAN EXITS HURRIEDLY.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER - MEDITATION CUBICLE

THE DARK CUBICLE IS ILLUMINATED BY A SINGLE SHAFT OF LIGHT WHICH FALLS
ON THE BROODING DARK LORD AS HE SITS ON A RAISED MEDITATION CUBE.
GENERAL VEERS ENTERS THE ROOM AND APPROACHES THE SILENT, UNMOVING
VADER.  ALTHOUGH SEEMINGLY VERY SURE OF HIMSELF, VEERS IS STILL NOT
BOLD ENOUGH TO INTERRUPT THE MEDITATING LORD.  THE YOUNGER GENERAL
STANDS QUIETLY AT ATTENTION UNTIL THE EVIL PRESENCE SPEAKS.

				VADER
		WHAT IS IT, GENERAL?

				VEERS
		MY LORD, THE FLEET HAS MOVES OUT
		OF LIGHT-SPEED.  COM-SCAN HAS
		DETECTED AN ENERGY FIELD PROTECTING
		AN AREA AROUND THE SIXTH PLANET OF
		THE HOTH SYSTEM.  THE FIELD IS
		STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFLECT ANY
		BOMBARDMENT.

				VADER
			(ANGRILY)
		THE REBELS ARE ALERTED TO OUR
		PRESENCE.  ADMIRAL OZZEL CAME OUT
		OF LIGHT-SPEED TOO CLOSE TO THE
		SYSTEM.

				VEERS
		HE FELT SURPRISE WAS WISER...

				VADER
		HE IS AS CLUMSY AS HE IS STUPID.
		GENERAL, PREPARE YOUR TROOPS FOR A
		SURFACE ATTACK.

				VEERS
		YES, MY LORD.

VEERS TURNS SMARTLY AND LEAVES AS VADER ACTIVATES A LARGE VIEWSCREEN
SHOWING THE BRIDGE OF HIS MIGHTY SHIP.  ADMIRAL OZZEL APPEARS ON THE
VIEWSCREEN, STANDING SLIGHTLY IN FRONT OF CAPTAIN PIETT.

				OZZEL
		LORD VADER, THE FLEET HAS MOVED
		OUT OF LIGHT-SPEED, AND WE'RE
		PREPARING TO... AAAGH!

				VADER
		YOU HAVE FAILED ME FOR THE LAST
		TIME, ADMIRAL.  CAPTAIN PIETT.

PIETT STEPS FORWARD, AS THE ADMIRAL MOVES AWAY, SLIGHTLY CONFUSED,
TOUCHING HIS THROAT AS IT BEGINS TO CONSTRICT PAINFULLY.

				PIETT
		YES, MY LORD.

				VADER
MAKE READY TO LAND OUT TROOPS BEYOND
THE ENERGY SHIELD AND DEPLOY THE
FLEET SO THAT NOTHING GETS OFF THAT
SYSTEM.  YOU ARE IN COMMAND NOW,
ADMIRAL PIETT.

				PIETT
		THANK YOU, LORD VADER.

PIETT'S PLEASURE ABOUT HIS UNEXPECTED PROMOTION IS NOT AN UNMIXED
EMOTION.  HE GLANCES WARILY AT THE STRUGGLING ADMIRAL OZZEL WHO, WITH A
FINAL CHOKE, STUMBLES AND FALLS IN A LIFELESS HEAP BEFORE HIM.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY, LEIA QUICKLY BRIEFS A GROUP OF PILOTS GATHERED
IN THE CENTER OF THE HANGAR.

IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER IS HIT IN THE CONNING TOWER BY THE POWERFUL
BOLTS, WHICH SET UP FIERY EXPLOSIONS ON ITS METAL HULL.

THE BIG STAR DESTROYER VEERS, THEN SPINS WILDLY OUT OF CONTROL.  AS THE

A THIN HORIZON LINE CUTS ACROSS THE BLEAK LANDSCAPE.  SMALL DOT-SIZE
OBJECTS BEGIN TO APPEAR ON THE HORIZON, MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
REBEL BASE.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

A REBEL OFFICER LIFTS A PAIR OF ELECTROBINOCULARS TO HIS EYES.  THROUGH

ADJUSTS THE VIEW WHICH THEN ZOOMS BACK TO REVEAL THREE MORE OF THE
OMINOUS BATTLE MACHINES.  SMALL FLASHES OF YELLOW FIRE BILLOW FROM THE
GUNS OF THE LUMBERING SNOW WALKERS.

THE OFFICER LOWERS HIS BINOCULARS AS THE REGULAR RHYTHMIC POUNDING
BEGINS TO MAKE THE GROUND VIBRATE.  THE POUNDING GROWS LOUDER AND IS
ACCOMPANIED BY A HIGH-PITCHED, METALLIC RATTLING.  THE OFFICER SPEAKS
INTO HIS COMLINK.

LUKE'S SPEEDER BANKS IN FROM THE SIDE OF VEERS'S WALKER AND HEADS
STRAIGHT FOR ITS VIEWPORT, BLASTING AWAY.  AN EXPLOSION HITS THE WALKER
WINDOW, BUT DISSIPATES, DOING NO HARM.  THE SPEEDER ROARS UP AND OVER
THE IMPREGNABLE WAR MACHINE.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

LUKE LOOKS BACK AT THE WALKER AS IT GROWS SMALLER IN THE DISTANCE.

CONTINUING THEIR RETREAT, THE REBELS SEE THE WALKERS LOOMING EVER
NEARER.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD - ICE PLAIN

ON THE BATTLEFIELD, LUKE WATCHES AS A WALKER FOOT RISES AND MOVES OVER
HIM.  HE LOOKS UP AT THE UNDERBELLY OF THE HUGE WALKER, PASSING
OVERHEAD.

RUNNING BENEATH THE MONSTROUS MACHINE, LUKE FIRES HIS HARPOON GUN AT
THE WALKER'S UNDERSIDE.  A THIN CABLE FOLLOWS THE PROJECTILE FROM THE
GUN.  THE MAGNETIC HEAD AND CABLE ATTACH FIRMLY TO THE METAL HULL.

STILL RUNNING UNDER THE WALKER, LUKE ATTACHES THE CABLE DRUM TO HIS
BELT BUCKLE.  SOON HE IS PULLED UP THE CABLE AND HANGS DANGLING
UNDERNEATH THE WALKER.

THE WALKER'S GIANT FEET CONTINUE TO POUND ONWARD ACROSS THE FROZEN
SNOW.  STRAY LASER BOLTS WHISTLE BY LUKE AS HE CLIMBS UP THE CABLE TO
THE WALKER'S HULL, REACHING A SMALL HATCH.  HANGING PRECARIOUSLY, LUKE
CUTS THE SOLID METAL HATCH WITH HIS LASER SWORD.

HE TAKES A LANDMINE FROM AROUND HIS NECK AND THROWS IT INSIDE THE
IMPERIAL MACHINE.  QUICKLY, LUKE STARTS DOWN THE CABLE AND CRASHES ONTO
THE ICY GROUND FAR BELOW.  HE LIES UNCONSCIOUS AS A GIANT REAR LEG
PASSES BY - AND JUST MISSES HIM.

THE GIANT WALKER STOPS IN MID-STEP.  A MUFFLED EXPLOSION COMES FROM
WITHIN - AND THEN THE WALKER'S MECHANICAL INSIDES  ARE SPEWED OUT EVERY
CONCEIVABLE OPENING.  THE MACHINE SITS DEAD IN ITS TRACKS, SMOKING LIKE
A LOCOMOTIVE ON STILTS.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

VEERS'S WALKER CONTINUES TO ADVANCE TOWARD THE REBEL BASE.  THE

		TARGET.  MAXIMUM FIRE POWER.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

THE REBEL TROOPS CONTINUE THEIR DESPERATE RETREAT, PUSHED BACK BY THE
RELENTLESS IMPERIAL ASSAULT.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDORS

WITH THREEPIO LAGGING BEHIND, HAN AND LEIA RACE THROUGH THE CRUMBLING
ICE CORRIDORS.  SUDDENLY, THERE IS AN EXPLOSION.  HAN TURNS, GRABS THE
PRINCESS, AND PULLS HER TO THE WALL AS A TREMENDOUS CAVE-IN BLACKS
THEIR PATH.

HE TAKES THE COMLINK FROM HIS POCKET.

				HAN
			(INTO COMLINK)
		TRANSPORT, THIS IS SOLO.  BETTER
		TAKE OFF - I CAN'T GET TO YOU.
		I'LL GET THE PRINCESS OUT ON THE
		FALCON.

HAN AND LEIA TURN AND RACE DOWN THE CORRIDOR.

				THREEPIO
		BUT... BUT... BUT... WHERE ARE
		YOU GOING?  UH... COME BACK!!

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

IMPERIAL TROOPS HAVE REACHED THE BASE.  AS THEY PUSH THROUGH THE
BLOCKED PASSAGEWAY, DARTH VADER STRIDES BEHIND THEM.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

HAN AND LEIA RUN TOWARD THE ENTRANCE OF THE MAIN HANGAR WHERE THE
MILLENNIUM FALCON IS DOCKED.  THREEPIO STILL LAGS BEHIND.

				THREEPIO
		WAIT!  WAIT FOR ME!  WAIT!  STOP!

THE DOOR TO THE HANGAR CLOSES IN HIS FACE.

				THREEPIO
			(EXASPERATED)
		HOW TYPICAL.

QUICKLY, THE DOOR REOPENS AS HAN REACHES OUT AND PULLS THE GOLDEN DROID
THROUGH.

				HAN
		COME ON.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

CHEWIE PACES UNDER THE SHELTER OF THE MILLENNIUM FALCON'S LANDING GEAR.
THE GIANT WOOKIEE PATS THE UNDERBELLY OF HIS BELOVED SHIP AND BARKS A
FEW REASSURING WORDS.  AS HE SEARCHES WORRIEDLY FOR HIS CAPTAIN,
SOMETHING AT LAST CATCHES HIS EYE.

CHEWIE LETS OUT A RELIEVED SHRIEK AT SEEING HAN AND LEIA RUNNING TOWARD
THE SHIP.  THE WOOKIEE RUNS OUT INTO THE FALLING ICE, LETS OUT A HOWL,
THEN RUNS UP THE SHIP'S RAMP.  HAN AND LEIA RUN UP THE RAMP AFTER HIM,
CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THREEPIO.

				HAN
		HURRY UP, GOLDENROD, OR YOU'RE
		GOING TO BE A PERMANENT RESIDENT!

				THREEPIO
		WAIT!  WAIT!

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

IMPERIAL TROOPS RUN THROUGH THE BASE CORRIDORS.  VADER SURVEYS THE
PLACE.  A HUGE CHUNK FALLS, ALMOST HITTING HIM, BUT  HE CALMLY,
PURPOSEFULLY, CONTINUES AROUND IT.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGER - MILLENNIUM FALCON

A DISTANT, HUGE, EXPLOSION ROCKS THE HANGAR DECK.  ICE CAKES COME
CRASHING DOWN ON THE MILLENNIUM FALCON.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD

HAN, STANDING BEFORE A CONTROL PANEL, IS BUSY FLIPPING SWITCHES AS
CHEWIE WATCHES A TROUBLESOME GAUGE.  A WORRIED LEIA OBSERVES THEIR
EFFORTS.

				HAN
			(TO CHEWIE)
		HOW'S THIS?

THE WOOKIEE BARKS A NEGATIVE REPLY.

				LEIA
		WOULD IT HELPED IF I GOT OUT AND
		PUSHED?

				HAN
		IT MIGHT.

THREEPIO CLANKS INTO THE HOLD.

				THREEPIO
		CAPTAIN SOLO, CAPTAIN SOLO... SIR,
		MIGHT I SUGGEST THAT YOU...

HAN GIVES THE GOLD ROBOT A DEVASTATING LOOK.

				THREEPIO
		IT CAN WAIT.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

THEY MOVE TO THE COCKPIT WHERE HAN FLIPS SOME MORE SWITCHES.  LEIA
WATCHES HIM, IMPATIENT, DISBELIEVING.

				LEIA
		THIS BUCKET OF BOLTS IS NEVER GOING
		TO GET US PAST THAT BLOCKADE.

				HAN
		THIS BABY'S GOT A FEW SURPRISES
		LEFT IN HER, SWEETHEART.

HAN AND LEIA LOOK OUT THE COCKPIT WINDOW AND SEE A SQUAD OF
STORMTROOPERS RUSHING INTO THE FAR SIDE OF THE HANGAR.

QUICKLY, HAN STRAPS HIMSELF INTO THE PILOT'S SEAT AND LEIA INTO THE
NAVIGATOR'S CHAIR.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

STORMTROOPERS HURRIEDLY SET UP A LARGE BAZOOKALIKE WEAPON.  BEHIND THEM
THE GIANT HANGAR DOORS OPEN SLOWLY.

EXT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON

A LASER GUN APPEARS ON THE FALCON AND SWINGS AROUND TO AIM AT THE
IMPERIAL TROOPS.

THE STORMTROOPERS, PREPARING TO FIRE THEIR BAZOOKA CANNON, ARE HIT BY
THE FALCON'S FIRE AND ARE THROWN ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

CHEWIE RUSHES INTO THE COCKPIT.

				HAN
		COME ON!  COME ON!  SWITCH OVER.
		LET'S HOPE WE DON'T HAVE A BURNOUT.

A LASER HITS THE WINDOW NEAR CHEWIE AS HE IS SETTLING INTO HIS CHAIR.
LETTING OUT A LOUD WHELP, CHEWIE QUICKLY PULLS BACK ON THE CONTROLS AND
THE FIRST STAGE OF ENGINE FIRE CAN BE HEARD.  HAN FLASHES A BIG GRIN AT
LEIA.

				HAN
		SEE?

				LEIA
		SOMEDAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE WRONG,
		AND I HOPE I'M THERE TO SEE IT.

HAN LOOKS AT CHEWIE.

				HAN
		PUNCH IT!

THE ROAR OF THE FALCON'S MAIN ENGINES BLASTS OUT EVERYTHING AS THE ICE-
CAVE WALL RUSHES BY OUTSIDE THE COCKPIT WINDOW.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

MORE STORMTROOPERS RUN INTO THE HANGAR, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY VADER.
HEARING THE LOUD ROAR OF THE MILLENNIUM FALCON'S ENGINES, VADER LOOKS
TOWARD THE MAIN HANGAR DOORS JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE FALCON LIFT UP AND
DISAPPEAR OUTSIDE THE CAVE.

EXT. HOTH - ICE SLOPE - DAY

LUKE AND TWO OTHER PILOTS LOOK UP AS THE MILLENNIUM FALCON RACES ABOVE
THEM, FLYING VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND.

THE THREE PILOTS TURN THEN, AND TRUDGE ONWARD TOWARD THEIR X-WING
FIGHTERS, EACH GOING TO HIS OWN SHIP.  LUKE WAVES FAREWELL, THEN HEADS
TOWARD HIS OWN FIGHTER.

ARTOO, SEATED ON HIS CUBBYHOLE, CHIRPS AN EXCITED GREETING AS LUKE
CLIMBS ABOARD THE SPACECRAFT.

				LUKE
		ARTOO!  GET HER READY FOR TAKEOFF.

FROM HIS SHIP, LUKE SEES WEDGE IN HIS OWN X-WING, PREPARING FOR
TAKEOFF.

				WEDGE
		GOOD LUCK, LUKE.  SEE YOU AT
		THE RENDEZVOUS.

LUKE SMILES AND NODS AT WEDGE, THEN LOWERS HIMSELF INTO THE COCKPIT OF
HIS X-WING WHILE ARTOO WAITS IN THE CUBBYHOLE, BEEPING IMPATIENTLY.

				LUKE
		DON'T WORRY, ARTOO.  WE'RE GOING,
		WE'RE GOING.

THE CANOPY OVER THE X-WING LOWERS AND SNAPS SHUT.

EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING

LUKE'S FIGHTER, ITS WINGS CLOSED, SPEEDS AWAY FROM THE ICY PLANET.
SOON IT DISAPPEARS INTO THE STARS.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

LUKE, LOOKING THOUGHTFUL, SUDDENLY MAKES A DECISION.  HE FLIPS SEVERAL
SWITCHES.  THE STARS SHIFT AS HE TAKES HIS FIGHTER INTO A STEEP TURN.
THE X-WING BANKS SHARPLY AND FLIES AWAY IN A NEW DIRECTION.

THE MONITOR SCREEN ON LUKE'S CONTROL PANEL PRINTS OUT A QUESTION FROM
THE CONCERNED ARTOO.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		THERE'S NOTHING WRONG, ARTOO.
		I'M JUST SETTING A NEW COURSE.

ARTOO BEEPS ONCE AGAIN.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		WE'RE NOT GOING TO REGROUP WITH
		THE OTHERS.

ARTOO BEGINS A PROTEST, WHISTLING AN UNBELIEVING, "WHAT?!"

LUKE READS ARTOO'S EXCLAMATION ON HIS CONTROL PANEL.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		WE'RE GOING TO THE DAGOBAH SYSTEM.

LUKE CHECKS HIS READOUTS AND MAKES A FEW ADJUSTMENTS.  HE RIDES ALONG
WITH ONLY THE SOFT HUM OF THE INSTRUMENTS TO BREAK THE SILENCE.
FINALLY, ARTOO CHIRPS UP.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		YES, ARTOO?

ARTOO UTTERS A SOFT, CAREFULLY PHRASED STEAM OF WHISTLES.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK, CHUCKLING)
		THAT'S ALL RIGHT.  I'D LIKE TO
		KEEP IT ON MANUAL CONTROL FOR A
		WHILE.

THE LITTLE DROID LETS OUT A DEFEATED WHIMPER.  LUKE SMILES, AND
CONTINUES ON HIS COURSE.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON SPEEDS AWAY FROM HOTH, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY ONE
HUGE STAR DESTROYER AND FOUR TINY TIE FIGHTERS.

AS IT IS PURSUED, THE FALCON RACES TOWARD TWO VERY BRIGHT STAR-SIZED
OBJECTS.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

INSIDE THE COCKPIT, CHEWIE LETS OUT A LOUD HOWL.  HAN CHECKS AS THE
SHIP IS BUFFETED BY EXPLODING FLAK.  HE APPEARS TO BE DOING SIX THINGS
AT ONCE.

				HAN
			(HARRIED)
		I SAW THEM!  I SAW THEM!

				LEIA
		SAW WHAT?

				HAN
		STAR DESTROYERS, TWO OF THEM,
		COMING RIGHT AT US.

THREEPIO BUMPS AND BANGS HIS WAY INTO THE COCKPIT.

				THREEPIO
		SIR, SIR!  MIGHT I SUGGEST...

				HAN
			(TO LEIA)
		SHUT HIM UP OR SHUT HIM DOWN!
			(TO CHEWIE)
		CHECK THE DEFLECTOR SHIELD!

CHEWIE BARKS A REPLY AS HE READJUSTS AN OVERHEAD SWITCH.

				HAN
		OH, GREAT.  WELL, WE CAN STILL
		OUTMANEUVER THEM.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYERS

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON RACES TOWARD ONE OF THE HUGE ONCOMING STAR
DESTROYERS.  SUDDENLY, THE FALCON STARTS INTO A DEEP DIVE STRAIGHT
DOWN, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY FOUR TIE FIGHTERS.  THE UNDERSIDE OF THE STAR
DESTROYER CONTINUES ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH TWO ONCOMING STAR
DESTROYERS.  SLOWLY, IT STARTS TO VEER TO THE LEFT.

INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
OUT THE FRONT WINDOW, THE TWO APPROACHING STAR DESTROYERS CAN BE SEEN
VEERING TO THE LEFT.

				IMPERIAL OFFICER
		TAKE EVASIVE ACTION!

ALARMS SOUND ALL OVER THE HUGE SHIP.  THE TWO OTHER STAR DESTROYERS GET
CLOSER, ONE OF THEM MOVING OVER THE BRIDGE SO CLOSE THAT IT MAKES
BRUSHING CONTACT WITH IT.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON RACES AWAY FROM THE COLLIDING STAR DESTROYERS,
STILL FOLLOWED BY FOUR TIE FIGHTERS.  LASER BOLTS SPARK THE PITCH-BLACK
SKIES.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

THINGS HAVE CALMED DOWN A BIT, BUT THE RACE ISN'T OVER YET.  CHEWIE
BARKS AT HAN.  LEIA IS STILL TRYING TO RECOVER FROM THE STEEP DIVE.
THE SHIP IS BUFFETED BY LASER BLASTS.

				HAN
		PREPARE TO MAKE THE JUMP TO LIGHT-
		SPEED.

				THREEPIO
		BUT, SIR!

THE BUFFETING OF LASERS BECOMES LOUDER AND STRONGER.

				LEIA
		THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER!

				HAN
			(WITH A GLEAM IN HIS
			 EYE)
		OH YEAH?  WATCH THIS.

EXPECTANTLY, THEY LOOK OUT THE COCKPIT WINDOW AS STARS DO NOT GO INTO
HYPERSPACE, BUT JUST SIT THERE.

HAN AND CHEWIE LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND ARE THROWN INTO AN ACUTE STATE OF
CONCERN.

				LEIA
		WATCH WHAT?

HAN TRIES AGAIN.  STILL NOTHING.

				HAN
		I THINK WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

				THREEPIO
		IF I MAY SAY SO, SIR, I NOTICED
		EARLIER THAT THE HYPERDRIVE
		MOTIVATOR HAS BEEN DAMAGED.  IT'S
		IMPOSSIBLE TO GO TO LIGHT-SPEED!

				HAN
		WE'RE IN TROUBLE!

THE EXPLOSIONS BECOME HEAVIER.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - STAR DESTROYER

THE FALCON RACES INTO THE STARRY VASTNESS, FOLLOWED BY THE FOUR
IMPERIAL TIE FIGHTERS AND AN IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

STARS RACE BY AS FLAK BURSTS OUTSIDE THE FALCON'S WINDOW.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

HAN WORKS FURIOUSLY AT SOME CONTROL PANELS WHILE GIVING VARIOUS ORDERS
TO CHEWIE.

				HAN
		HORIZONTAL BOOSTERS...!
			(CHEWIE BARKS)
		ALLUVIAL DAMPERS...!  WELL THAT'S
		NOT IT.
			(CHEWIE BARKS)
		BRING ME THE HYDROSPANNERS!

CHEWIE HURRIES OVER TO THE PIT AND PLACES THE TOOLS ON THE EDGE.

				HAN
		I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO
		GET OUT OF THIS ONE.

SUDDENLY, A LOUD THUMP HITS THE SIDE OF THE FALCON, CAUSING IT TO LURCH
RADICALLY.  CHEWIE BARKS.  THE TOOLS FALL INTO THE PIT ON TOP OF HAN.

				HAN
		OWW!  CHEWIE!

MORE TURBULENCE ROCKS THE SHIP.

				HAN
		THAT WAS NO LASER BLAST!  SOMETHING
		HIT US.

				LEIA
			(OVER COMLINK)
		HAN, GET UP HERE!

				HAN
		COME ON, CHEWIE!

HAN CLIMBS OUT OF THE HOLD LIKE A SHOT.  BOTH HE AND CHEWIE RUN OUT OF
THE HOLD AND TOWARD THE COCKPIT.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

OUT THE FRONT COCKPIT WINDOW, THEY SEE HUNDREDS OF ASTEROIDS RACING BY.

				LEIA
		ASTEROIDS!

HAN CHANGES PLACES WITH LEIA WHO HAS BEEN AT THE CONTROLS, AND CHEWIE
GETS INTO HIS CHAIR.  HAN WORKS HIS CONTROLS AS A CHUNK OF ROCK CROSSES
IN FRONT OF THE SHIP.

				HAN
		OH, NO!  CHEWIE, SET TWO-SEVEN-
		ONE.

				LEIA
		WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  YOU'RE NOT
		ACTUALLY GOING INTO AN ASTEROID
		FIELD?

				HAN
		THEY'D BE CRAZY TO FOLLOW US,
		WOULDN'T THEY?

ANOTHER ASTEROID THUMPS AGAINST THE SHIP AND LEIA WINCES AT THE JOLT.

				LEIA
		YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS TO
		IMPRESS ME.

				THREEPIO
		SIR, THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCCESSFULLY
		NAVIGATING AN ASTEROID FIELD IS
		APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND, SEVEN
		HUNDRED AND TWENTY TO ONE.

				HAN
		NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS!

EXT. ASTEROID BELT - MILLENNIUM FALCON

THE FALCON TURNS INTO THE ASTEROID STORM AND AS THE SHIP COMPLETES ITS
TURN, ASTEROIDS START COMING STRAIGHT AT THE COCKPIT WINDOWS.

A LARGE ASTEROID TUMBLES AWAY FROM THE FALCON'S PATH AT TOP SPEED.
SEVERAL SMALLER ASTEROIDS CRASH INTO THE BIG ONE, CREATING SMALL
EXPLOSIONS ON ITS SURFACE.  OTHER ASTEROIDS OF ALL SIZES PASS BY IN
EVERY DIRECTION, SOME COLLIDING AND EXPLODING.  THE TINY MILLENNIUM
FALCON VEERS AROUND THE BIG ASTEROID AND RACES PAST IT THROUGH THE RAIN
OF ROCKS, FOLLOWED BY FOUR TIE FIGHTERS, WHICH BOB AND WEAVE AROUND THE
ASTEROIDS.

ONE OF THE PURSUING TIE FIGHTERS CONNECTS WITH AN ASTEROID AND
EXPLODES.  THE OTHER FIGHTERS ARE PELTED WITH A STEADY STREAM OF
SMALLER EXPLOSIONS.

TWO HUGE ASTEROIDS TUMBLE TOWARD THE MILLENNIUM FALCON, WHICH QUICKLY
BANKS AROUND BOTH OF THEM.  THE THREE TIE FIGHTERS FOLLOW IN HOT
PURSUIT UNTIL ONE OF THE FIGHTERS SCRAPES AN ASTEROID AND TUMBLES OUT
OF CONTROL INTO DEEP SPACE.

EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYER - ASTEROID BELT

THE MASSIVE STAR DESTROYER BLASTS ONCOMING ASTEROIDS AS IT FOLLOWS THE
FALCON.  SMALLER ASTEROIDS EXPLODE ACROSS ITS VAST SURFACE.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - ASTEROID BELT

THE FALCON TWISTS ON ITS SIDE AS IT RACES AROUND AN ONCOMING ASTEROID.
TWO TIE FIGHTERS FOLLOW IN THE DISTANCE, COMING FROM EITHER SIDE.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

ASTEROIDS RACE BY THE COCKPIT WINDOW AS HAN PILOTS HIS TRUSTY CRAFT
THROUGH THE DANGEROUS FIELD.

LOOKING OUT THE COCKPIT WINDOW, THE FALCON CREW SEES A BIG ASTEROID
DROP PAST THE WINDOW, NARROWLY MISSING THEIR SHIP.

CHEWIE BARKS IN TERROR AS A SLIGHTLY SMALLER ASTEROID COMES ESPECIALLY
CLOSE - TO CLOSE - AND BOUNCES OFF THE FALCON WITH A LOUD CRUNCH.
THREEPIO'S HANDS COVER HIS EYES.  HE MANAGES A SHORT PEEK AT THE
COCKPIT WINDOW.  PRINCESS LEIA SITS STONE-FACED, STARING AT THE ACTION.
HAN GIVES HER A QUICK LOOK.

				HAN
		YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO BE AROUND
		WHEN I MADE A MISTAKE; WELL, THIS
		COULD BE IT, SWEETHEART.

				LEIA
		I TAKE IT BACK.  WE'RE GOING TO
		GET PULVERIZED IF WE STAY OUT HERE
		MUCH LONGER.

THE GROUP WATCHES AS MORE ASTEROIDS RACE BY OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.

				HAN
		I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH THAT.

				THREEPIO
		PULVERIZED?

				HAN
		I'M GOING IN CLOSER TO ONE OF
		THOSE BIG ONES.

				LEIA
		CLOSER?

				THREEPIO
		CLOSER?!

CHEWBACCA BARKS THE SAME WORD, ONLY LOUDER.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON DIVES TOWARD THE SURFACE OF ONE OF THE MOON-SIZED
ASTEROIDS.  THERE IS A CONTINUED DISPLAY OF EXPLOSIONS AGAINST THE
STARRY VOID AS SMALLER ASTEROIDS COLLIDE WITH LARGER CHUNKS OF ROCK.
THE TWO REMAINING TIE FIGHTERS FOLLOW THE FALCON TO THE LARGE ASTEROID.
THE FALCON SKIMS THE SURFACE OF THE GIANT ASTEROID AS, ALL THE WHILE,
SMALL ASTEROIDS EXPLODE ON THE SURFACE OF THE SHIP.

THE TIE FIGHTERS APPROACH THE FALCON, BUT A GIANT ASTEROID HURTLES
DIRECTLY INTO THEIR PATH.  AS THE ASTEROID CONTINUES ON ITS WAY, IT
LEAVES REMAINS OF THE TWO EXPLODED TIE FIGHTERS TO TUMBLE INTO DEEP
SPACE.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

RATTLED BY THE VIOLENT ROCKING OF THE STARSHIP, THREEPIO IS NEARLY IN
HYSTERICS.

				THREEPIO
		OH, THIS IS SUICIDE!

HAN NOTICES SOMETHING ON HIS MAIN SCOPE AND NUDGES HIS FAITHFUL
WOOKIEE, POINTING.

				HAN
		THERE.  THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

				LEIA
		WHAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD?

				HAN
		YEAH.  THAT'LL DO NICELY.

				THREEPIO
			(TO LEIA)
		EXCUSE ME, MA'AM, BUT WHERE ARE
		WE GOING?

OUT THE COCKPIT WINDOW, THEY SEE THAT THEY ARE SKIMMING THE SURFACE OF
THE ENORMOUS ASTEROID AND NEARING A LARGE CRATER.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON DIVES INTO THE HUGE CRATER AND DISAPPEARS.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				LEIA
		I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

				HAN
		YEAH, ME TOO.

INT. GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

THE FALCON RACES DOWN INTO THE CRATER.  THE WALLS ARE BARELY VISIBLE AS
THE SHIP SPEED THROUGH THE TUNNELLIKE OPENING.  A SMALL CAVE APPEARS ON
ONE SIDE OF THE CRATER, AND THE FALCON TURNS, SLOWS, AND SCOOTS INTO
IT.

EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING

THE TINY X-WING SPEEDS TOWARD THE CLOUD COVER OF DAGOBAH.  ARTOO,
RIDING ON THE BACK OF THE FIGHTER, TURNS HIS HEAD BACK AND FORTH WITH
SOME ANXIETY.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

LUKE WATCHES ARTOO'S WORDS AS THEY ARE TRANSLATED AND SCREENED ON THE
COMPUTER SCOPE.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		YES, THAT'S IT.  DAGOBAH.

ARTOO BEEPS A HOPEFUL INQUIRY.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		NO, I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY
		MIND ABOUT THIS.
			(GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS)
		I'M NOT PICKING UP ANY CITIES OR
		TECHNOLOGY.  MASSIVE LIFE-FORM
		READINGS, THOUGH.  THERE'S SOMETHING
		ALIVE DOWN THERE...

ARTOO BEEPS, THIS TIME A SLIGHTLY WORRIED QUESTION.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		YES, I'M SURE IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE
		FOR DROIDS.

EXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH -  LUKE'S X-WING

THE X-WING CONTINUES ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE TWILIGHT ABOVE THE CLOUD-
COVERED PLANET.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

LUKE SEES THE CLOUD RACE BY AS HE TAKES HIS CRAFT CLOSER TO THE PLANET.
HE MUST OPERATE HIS CONTROLS CAREFULLY SINCE THE CLOUD COVER HAS
COMPLETELY OBSCURED HIS VISION.  AN ALARM BUZZES IN THE BACKGROUND,
ARTOO BEEPS AND WHISTLES FRANTICALLY.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		I KNOW, I KNOW!  ALL THE SCOPES ARE
		DEAD.  I CAN'T SEE A THING!  JUST
		HANG ON, I'M GOING TO START THE
		LANDING CYCLE...

THE BLAST OF THE RETROROCKETS IS DEAFENING, DROWNING OUT ARTOO'S
ELECTRONIC SQUEALS.  SUDDENLY, THERE IS A CRACKING SOUND AS IF LIMBS
WERE BEING BROKEN OFF TREES AND THEN A TREMENDOUS JOLT AS THE
SPACECRAFT STOPS.  LUKE PULLS A SWITCH AND HIS CANOPY POPS OPEN.

EXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK

THE MIST-SHROUDED X-WING FIGHTER IS ALMOST INVISIBLE IN THE THICK FOG.
LUKE CLIMBS OUT ONTO THE LONG NOSE OF THE SPACECRAFT AS ARTOO POPS OUT
OF HIS CUBBYHOLE ON THE BACK.  THE YOUNG WARRIOR SURVEYS THE FOG, WHICH
IS BARELY PIERCED BY THE SHIP'S LANDING LIGHTS.  ABOUT ALL HE CAN MAKE
OUT ARE SOME GIANT, TWISTED TREES NEARBY.  ARTOO WHISTLES ANXIOUSLY.

				LUKE
		NO, ARTOO, YOU STAY PUT.  I'LL
		HAVE A LOOK AROUND.

ARTOO LETS OUT A SHORT BEEP.  AS LUKE MOVES ALONG THE NOSE, ARTOO LOSES
HIS BALANCE AND DISAPPEARS WITH A SPLASH INTO THE BOGGY LAKE.

				LUKE
		ARTOO?

LUKE KNEELS AND LEANS OVER THE PLANE LOOKING FOR ARTOO, BUT THE WATER
IS STILL AND REVEALS NO SIGN OF THE LITTLE DROID.

				LUKE
		ARTOO!  WHERE ARE YOU?

A SMALL PERISCOPE BREAKS THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND A GURGLY BEEP IS
HEARD.  THE PERISCOPE STARTS TO MOVE TO SHORE.  RELIEVED, LUKE STARTS
RUNNING ALONG THE NOSE OF THE FIGHTER TO ITS TIP.

				LUKE
		ARTOO!  YOU BE MORE CAREFUL.

THE OUTLINE OF THE SHORE IS NOW MORE THAN TEN FEET AWAY.

LUKE JUMPS OFF THE PLANE INTO THE WATER, SCRAMBLES UP TO THE SHORE, AND
TURNS TO LOOK FOR ARTOO.  THE PERISCOPE STILL STEADILY MOVES TOWARD
SHORE.

				LUKE
		ARTOO - THAT WAY!

SUDDENLY, THROUGH THE THICK FOG LAYER, A DARK SHAPE APPEARS, MOVING
TOWARD THE LITTLE DROID.  THE DARK, SINUOUS BOG BEAST DIVES BENEATH THE
SWAMPY WATER, MAKING A LOUD CLUNK AGAINST ARTOO'S METAL HULL.  THE
DROID DISAPPEARS FROM SIGHT, UTTERING A PATHETIC ELECTRONIC SCREAM.

HOLDING HIS IGNITED LIGHTSABER BEFORE HIM, LUKE WADES A FEW FEET INTO
THE MURKY POOL, LOOKING FOR ANY SIGN OF HIS LITTLE FRIEND.

				LUKE
		ARTOO!

THE BLACK SURFACE IS STILL AS DEATH ITSELF... UNTIL A FEW BUBBLES BEGIN
TO APPEAR.  THEN, PHHEEWAAT!! THE RUNT-SIZE ROBOT IS SPIT OUT OF THE
WATER, MAKES A GRACEFUL ARC, AND COMES CRASHING DOWN INTO A PATCH OF
SOFT GRAY MOSS.

				LUKE
		OH, NO!  ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?  COME
		ON.  YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DON'T TASTE
		VERY GOOD.  ANYTHING BROKEN?

LUKE HELPS ARTOO TO HIS FEET AND BEGINS WIPING THE MUD AND ROOTS FROM
HIS ROUND METAL BODY.  ARTOO RESPONDS WITH FEEBLE, SOGGY BEEPS.

				LUKE
		IF YOU'RE SAYING COMING HERE WAS
		A BAD IDEA, I'M BEGINNING TO AGREE
		WITH YOU.  OH, ARTOO, WHAT ARE WE
		DOING HERE?  IT'S LIKE... SOMETHING
		OUT OF A DREAM, OR, I DON'T KNOW.
		MAYBE I'M JUST GOING CRAZY.

AS LUKE GLANCES AROUND AT THE SPOOKY SWAMP JUNGLE THAT SURROUNDS HIM,
ARTOO EJECTS A STREAM OF MUDDY WATER FROM ONE OF HIS CRANIAL PORTS.

EXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

ADMIRAL PIETT HESITATES IN THE ENTRYWAY TO VADER'S PRIVATE CUBICLE.

AFTER A MOMENT, HE STEPS INTO THE ROOM AND PAUSES AT THE SURPRISING
SIGHT BEFORE HIM.

DARTH VADER, HIS BACK TURNED, IS SILHOUETTED IN THE GLOOM ON THE FAR
SIDE OF THE CHAMBER.  A BLACK, INSECTLIKE DROID ATTENDS HIM.  AMONG THE
VARIOUS APPARATUSES SURROUNDING THEM, A RESPIRATOR TUBE NOW RETRACTS
FROM VADER'S UNCOVERED HEAD.  THE HEAD IS BALD WITH A MASS OF UGLY SCAR
TISSUE COVERING IT.  THE BLACK DROID THEN LOWERS THE MASK AND HELMET
ONTO VADER'S HEAD.  WHEN IT IS IN PLACE, THE DARK LORD TURNS TO FACE
PIETT.

				VADER
		YES, ADMIRAL?

				PIETT
OUR SHIPS HAVE SIGHTED THE
MILLENNIUM FALCON, LORD.  BUT...
IT HAS ENTERED AN ASTEROID FIELD
AND WE CANNOT RISK...

				VADER
			(INTERRUPTING)
		ASTEROIDS DO NOT CONCERN ME,
		ADMIRAL.  I WANT THAT SHIP AND
		NOT EXCUSES.

				PIETT
		YES, LORD.

EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

THE PIRATE STARSHIP RESTS IN A DARK, DRIPPING ASTEROID CAVE.  IT IS SO
DARK THAT THE CAVE'S EXACT DIMENSIONS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

HAN AND CHEWIE BUSILY SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE AND ALL ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS.
THREEPIO AND LEIA WATCH WORRIEDLY.

				HAN
		I'M GOING TO SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING
		BUT THE EMERGENCY POWER SYSTEMS.

				THREEPIO
		SIR, I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO ASK,
		BUT... DOES THAT INCLUDE SHUTTING
		ME DOWN, TOO?

CHEWIE BARKS "YES".  BUT HAN THINKS OTHERWISE.

				HAN
		NO, I NEED YOU TO TALK TO THE
		FALCON, FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH
		THE HYPERDRIVE.

SUDDENLY, THE SHIP LURCHES, CAUSING ALL THE LOOSE ITEMS IN THE COCKPIT
TO GO FLYING.  CHEWIE HOWLS.

				THREEPIO
		SIR, IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THIS
		ASTEROID IS NOT ENTIRELY STABLE.

				HAN
		NOT ENTIRELY STABLE?  I'M GLAD YOU'RE
		HERE TO TELL US THESE THINGS.  CHEWIE,
		TAKE THE PROFESSOR IN THE BACK AND
		PLUG HIM INTO THE HYPERDRIVE.

				THREEPIO
		OH!  SOMETIMES I JUST DON'T
		UNDERSTAND HUMAN BEHAVIOR.  AFTER
		ALL, I'M ONLY TRYING TO DO MY JOB
		IN THE MOST...

THE SLIDING DOOR CLOSES BEHIND THE INDIGNANT THREEPIO AS CHEWIE AND HE
MOVE BACK TO THE HOLD.  SUDDENLY, THE SHIP LURCHES AGAIN, THROWING LEIA
ACROSS THE CABIN INTO HAN'S ARMS.  THEN, ABRUPTLY, THE MOTION STOPS AS
SUDDENLY AS IT STARTED.  WITH SOME SURPRISE, HAN AND LEIA REALIZE THEY
ARE IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS.

				LEIA
		LET GO.

				HAN
		SSHH!

				LEIA
		LET GO, PLEASE.

LEIA FLUSHES, AVERTING HER EYES.  SHE'S NOT EXACTLY FIGHTING TO GET
FREE.  BUT, OF COURSE, HAN BLOWS IT...

				HAN
		DON'T GET EXCITED.

THE ANGER RISES IN LEIA.

				LEIA
		CAPTAIN, BEING HELD BY YOU ISN'T
		QUITE ENOUGH TO GET ME EXCITED.

				HAN
		SORRY, SWEETHEART.  WE HAVEN'T
		GOT TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

HAN GRINS QUICKLY WICKEDLY AT LEIA AS HE TURNS AND EXITS THROUGH THE
DOOR.  LEIA'S CONFUSED EMOTIONS SHOW CLEARLY ON HER LOVELY FACE.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK

THE MIST HAS DISPERSED A BIT, BUT IT IS STILL A VERY GLOOMY-LOOKING
SWAMP.

LUKE PULLS AN EQUIPMENT BOX FROM THE SHORE TO THE CLEARING.  HE IGNITES
A LITTLE FUSION FURNACE AND WARMS HIS HANDS BEFORE IT.  TAKING A POWER
CABLE, HE PLUGS IT INTO ARTOO'S NOSELIKE SOCKET.

				LUKE
		READY FOR SOME POWER?  OKAY.
		LET'S SEE NOW.  PUT THAT IN
		THERE.  THERE YOU GO.

THE DROID WHISTLES HIS APPRECIATION.  LUKE THEN OPENS A CONTAINER OF
PROCESSED FOOD AND SITS BEFORE THE THERMAL HEATER.

				LUKE
			(SIGHS)
		NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS FIND THIS
		YODA... IF HE EVEN EXISTS.

NERVOUSLY, HE LOOKS AROUND AT THE FOREBODING JUNGLE.

				LUKE
		STILL... THERE'S SOMETHING FAMILIAR
		ABOUT THIS PLACE.  I FEEL LIKE...
		I DON'T KNOW...

				STRANGE VOICE
		FEEL LIKE WHAT?

LUKE JUMPS OUT OF HIS SKIN.  ARTOO SCREECHES IN TERROR.  THE YOUNG
WARRIOR GRABS FOR HIS LIGHTSABER AS HE SPINS AROUND, LOOKING FOR THE
SPEAKER.  MYSTERIOUSLY STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF LUKE IS A STRANGE,
BLUISH CREATURE, NOT MORE THAN TWO FEET TALL.  THE WIZENED LITTLE THING
IS DRESSED IN RAGS.  IT MOTIONS TOWARD LUKE'S SWORD.

				LUKE
			(LOOKING AT THE
			 CREATURE)
		LIKE WE'RE BEING WATCHED!

				CREATURE
		AWAY WITH YOUR WEAPON!  I MEAN
		YOU NO HARM.

AFTER SOME HESITATION, LUKE PUTS AWAY HIS WEAPON, ALTHOUGH HE REALLY
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY.  ARTOO WATCHES WITH INTEREST.

				CREATURE
		I AM WONDERING, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

				LUKE
		I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

				CREATURE
		LOOKING?  FOUND SOMEONE, YOU HAVE,
		I WOULD SAY, HMMM?

THE LITTLE CREATURE LAUGHS.

				LUKE
			(TRYING TO KEEP FROM
			 SMILING)
		RIGHT.

				CREATURE
		HELP YOU I CAN.  YES, MMMM.

				LUKE
		I DON'T THINK SO.  I'M LOOKING
		FOR A GREAT WARRIOR.

				CREATURE
		AHHH!  A GREAT WARRIOR.
			(LAUGHS AND SHAKES
			 HIS HEAD)
		WARS NOT MAKE ONE GREAT.

WITH THE AID OF A WALKING STICK, THE TINY STRANGER MOVES OVER TO ONE OF
THE CASES OF SUPPLIES.  HE BEGINS TO RUMMAGE AROUND.

ARTOO MOVES TO THE EDGE OF THE CASE - STANDING ALMOST EYE LEVEL TO THE
CREATURE WHO IS CARELESSLY HANDLING THE SUPPLIES - AND SQUEAKS HIS
DISAPPROVAL.

THEIR TINY VISITOR PICK UP THE CONTAINER OF FOOD LUKE WAS EATING FROM
AND TAKES A BITE.

				LUKE
		PUT THAT DOWN.  HEY!  THAT'S MY
		DINNER!

THE CREATURE SPITS OUT THE BITE HE HAS TAKEN.  HE MAKES A FACE.

				CREATURE
		HOW YOU GET SO BIG, EATING FOOD
		OF THIS KIND?

HE FLIPS THE CONTAINER IN LUKE'S DIRECTION AND REACHES INTO ONE OF
LUKE'S SUPPLY CASES.

				LUKE
		LISTEN, FRIEND, WE DIDN'T MEAN TO
		LAND IN THAT PUDDLE, AND IF WE
		COULD GET OUR SHIP OUT, WE WOULD,
		BUT WE CAN'T, SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST...

				CREATURE
			(TEASING)
		AWW, CANNOT GET YOUR SHIP OUT?

THE CREATURE SPOTS SOMETHING OF INTEREST IN LUKE'S CASE.  LUKE LOSES
PATIENCE AND GRABS THE CASE AWAY.  THE CREATURE RETAINS HIS PRIZE - A
TINY POWER LAMP - AND EXAMINES IT WITH DELIGHT.

				LUKE
		HEY, YOU COULD HAVE BROKEN THIS.
		DON'T DO THAT.  OHHH... YOU'RE
		MAKING A MESS.  HEY, GIVE ME THAT!

				CREATURE
			(RETREATING WITH
			 THE LAMP)
		MINE!  OR I WILL HELP YOU NOT.

CLUTCHING ITS TREASURE, THE CREATURE BACKS AWAY FROM LUKE, DRAWING
CLOSER TO ARTOO.  AS LUKE AND THE CREATURE ARGUE, ONE OF ARTOO'S LITTLE
ARMS SLOWLY MOVES OUT TOWARD THE POWER LAMP, COMPLETELY UNNOTICED BY
THE CREATURE.

				LUKE
		I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.  I WANT
		MY LAMP BACK.  I'LL NEED IT TO
		GET OUT OF THIS SLIMY MUDHOLE.

				CREATURE
		MUDHOLE?  SLIMY?  MY HOME THIS IS.

ARTOO GRABS HOLD OF THE LAMP AND THE TWO LITTLE FIGURES ARE IMMEDIATELY
ENGAGED IN A TUG-OF-WAR OVER IT.

ARTOO BEEPS A FEW ANGRY, "GIVE ME THATS."

				CREATURE
		AH, AH, AH!

				LUKE
		OH, ARTOO, LET HIM HAVE IT!

				CREATURE
		MINE!  MINE!

				LUKE
		ARTOO!

				CREATURE
		MINE!

THE CREATURE LETS GO WITH ONE HAND AND POKES ARTOO LIGHTLY WITH ONE
FINGER.  ARTOO REACTS WITH A STARTLED SQUEAL, AND LETS GO.

				CREATURE
		MINE!

				LUKE
			(FED UP)
		NOW WILL YOU MOVE ALONG, LITTLE
		FELLA?  WE'RE GOT A LOT OF WORK
		TO DO.

				CREATURE
		NO!  NO, NO!  STAY AND HELP YOU,
		I WILL.
			(LAUGHS)
		FIND YOUR FRIEND, HMM?

				LUKE
		I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A FRIEND.
		I'M LOOKING FOR A JEDI MASTER.

				CREATURE
		OOHHH.  JEDI MASTER.  YODA.  YOU
		SEEK YODA.

				LUKE
		YOU KNOW HIM?

				CREATURE
		MMM.  TAKE YOU TO HIM, I WILL.
			(LAUGHS)
		YES, YES.  BUT NOW, WE MUST EAT.
		COME.  GOOD FOOD.  COME.

WITH THAT, THE CREATURE SCURRIES OUT OF THE CLEARING, LAUGHING MERRILY.
LUKE STARES AFTER HIM.  ALL HE SEES IS THE FAINT LIGHT FROM THE SMALL
POWER LAMP MOVING THROUGH THE FOG.  LUKE MAKES HIS DECISION AND STARTS
AFTER THE CREATURE.

				CREATURE
			(IN THE DISTANCE)
		COME, COME.

ARTOO, VERY UPSET, WHISTLES A BLUE STREAK OF PROTEST.

				LUKE
		STAY HERE AND WATCH AFTER THE
		CAMP, ARTOO.

ARTOO BEEPS EVEN MORE FRANTICALLY.  BUT AS LUKE DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW,
THE WORRIED LITTLE DROID GROWS QUIETER, AND UTTERS A SOFT ELECTRONIC
SIGH.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREA

THREEPIO WHISTLES AND BEEPS A STRANGE DIALECT INTO THE CONTROL PANEL IN
FRONT OF HIM.  THE CONTROL PANEL WHISTLES BACK A FEW MYSTIFYING BEEPS.

				THREEPIO
		OH, WHERE IS ARTOO WHEN I NEED
		HIM?

HAN ENTERS THE HOLD AREA AND KNEELS ON THE FLOOR NEAR THE CONTROL BOX.

				THREEPIO
		SIR, I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR SHIP
		LEARNED TO COMMUNICATE, BUT IT
		HAS THE MOST PECULIAR DIALECT.  I
		BELIEVE, SIR, IT SAYS THAT THE
		POWER COUPLING ON THE NEGATIVE
		AXIS HAS BEEN POLARIZED.  I'M
		AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO REPLACE IT.

				HAN
		WELL, OF COURSE I'LL HAVE TO REPLACE
		IT.

HE HANDS A WIRE COIL UP TO CHEWIE WHO IS WORKING NEAR THE CEILING.

				HAN
		HERE!  AND CHEWIE...

CHEWIE BRINGS HIS HEAD BACK THROUGH THE TRAP DOOR IN THE CEILING AND
WHINES.  HAN GLANCES BACK AT THREEPIO, THEN SPEAKS QUIETLY TO CHEWIE SO
ONLY HE CAN HEAR.

				HAN
			(CONTINUING)
		... I THINK WE'D BETTER REPLACE
		THE NEGATIVE POWER COUPLING.

LEIA FINISHES WELDING THE VALVES SHE HAS BEEN WORKING ON AND ATTEMPTS
TO REENGAGE THE SYSTEM BY PULLING A LEVER ATTACHED TO THE VALVE.  IT
DOESN'T BUDGE.  HAN NOTICES HER STRUGGLE, AND MOVES TO HELP HER.  SHE
REBUFFS HIM.

				HAN
		HEY, YOUR WORSHIP, I'M ONLY
		TRYING TO HELP.

				LEIA
			(STILL STRUGGLING)
		WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP CALLING ME
		THAT?

HAN HEARS A NEW TONE IN HER VOICE.  HE WATCHES HER PULL ON THE LEVER.

				HAN
		SURE, LEIA.

				LEIA
		OH, YOU MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT
		SOMETIMES.

				HAN
		I DO, I REALLY DO.  YOU COULD BE
		A LITTLE NICER, THOUGH.
			(HE WATCHES HER
			 REACTION)
		COME ON, ADMIT IT.  SOMETIMES YOU
		THINK I'M ALL RIGHT.

SHE LETS GO OF THE LEVER AND RUBS HER SORE HAND.

				LEIA
		OCCASIONALLY...
			(A LITTLE SMILE,
			 HALTINGLY)
		... WHEN YOU AREN'T ACTING LIKE
		A SCOUNDREL.

				HAN
			(LAUGHS)
		SCOUNDREL?  SCOUNDREL?  I LIKE
		THE SOUND OF THAT.

WITH THAT, HAN TAKES HER HAND AND STARTS TO MASSAGE IT.

				LEIA
		STOP THAT.

				HAN
		STOP WHAT?

LEIA IS FLUSHES, CONFUSED.

				LEIA
		STOP THAT!  MY HANDS ARE DIRTY.

				HAN
		MY HANDS ARE DIRTY, TOO.  WHAT
		ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

				LEIA
			(LOOKING RIGHT
			 INTO HIS EYES)
		AFRAID?

HAN LOOKS AT HER WITH A PIERCING LOOK.  HE'S NEVER LOOKED MORE
HANDSOME, MORE DASHING, MORE CONFIDENT.  HE REACHES OUT SLOWLY AND
TAKES LEIA'S HAND AGAIN FROM WHERE IT IS RESTING ON A CONSOLE.  HE
DRAWS IT TOWARD HIM.

				HAN
		YOU'RE TREMBLING.

				LEIA
		I'M NOT TREMBLING.

THEN WITH AN IRRESISTIBLE COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND
EMOTIONAL POWER, THE SPACE PIRATE BEGINS TO DRAW LEIA TOWARD HIM...
VERY SLOWLY.

				HAN
		YOU LIKE ME BECAUSE I'M A SCOUNDREL.
		THERE AREN'T ENOUGH SCOUNDRELS IN
		YOUR LIFE.

LEIA IS NOW VERY CLOSE TO HAN AND AS SHE SPEAKS, HER VOICE BECOMES AN
EXCITED WHISPER, A TONE COMPLETELY IN OPPOSITION TO HER WORDS.

				LEIA
		I HAPPEN TO LIKE NICE MEN.

				HAN
		I'M A NICE MAN.

				LEIA
		NO, YOU'RE NOT.  YOU'RE...

HE KISSES HER NOW, WITH SLOW, HOT LIPS.  HE TAKES HIS TIME, AS THOUGH
HE HAD FOREVER, BENDING HER BODY BACKWARD.  SHE HAS NEVER BEEN KISSED
LIKE THIS BEFORE, AND IT ALMOST MAKES HER FAINT.  WHEN HE STOPS, SHE
REGAINS HER BREATH AND TRIES TO WORK UP SOME INDIGNATION, BUT FINDS IT
HARD TO TALK.

SUDDENLY, THREEPIO APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY, SPEAKING EXCITEDLY.

				THREEPIO
		SIR, SIR!  I'VE ISOLATED THE
		REVERSE POWER FLUX COUPLING.

HAN TURNS SLOWLY, ICILY, FROM THEIR EMBRACE.

				HAN
		THANK YOU.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

				THREEPIO
		OH, YOU'RE PERFECTLY WELCOME, SIR.

THE MOMENT SPOILED, HAN MARCHES OUT AFTER THREEPIO.

EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD

THE IMPERIAL FLEET MOVES THROUGH THE ASTEROID-FILLED VOID, INTENTLY
SEEKING ITS PREY.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

ASTEROIDS COLLIDE, CREATING A FIREWORKS DISPLAY OUTSIDE THE BRIDGE
WINDOW.  DARTH VADER STANDS, STARING OUT THE WINDOW ABOVE THE CONTROL
DECK.  THEN SLOWLY TURNS TOWARD THE BRIDGE.  BEFORE HIM ARE THE
HOLOGRAM IMAGES OF TWENTY BATTLESHIP COMMANDERS.  ONE OF THESE IMAGES,
THE COMMANDER OF A SHIP THAT HAS JUST EXPLODED, IS FADING AWAY QUICKLY.
ANOTHER IMAGE, IN THE CENTER AND A LITTLE APART FROM THE OTHERS, IS
FADED AND CONTINUALLY DISRUPTED BY STATIC.  IT IS THE IMAGE OF CAPTAIN
NEEDA, COMMANDER OF THE STAR DESTROYER MOST HOTLY ON THE TAIL OF THE
MILLENNIUM FALCON.  ADMIRAL PIETT AND AN AIDE STAND BEHIND THE DARK
LORD.

				NEEDA
			(IN HOLOGRAM)
		... AND THAT, LORD VADER, WAS THE
		LAST TIME THEY APPEARED IN ANY OF
		OUR SCOPES.  CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT
		OF DAMAGE WE'VE SUSTAINED, THEY
		MUST HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

				VADER
		NO, CAPTAIN, THEY'RE ALIVE.  I
		WANT EVERY SHIP AVAILABLE TO
		SWEEP THE ASTEROID FIELD UNTIL
		THEY ARE FOUND.

THE IMPERIAL STAR CAPTAINS FADE OUT ONE BY ONE AS VADER TURNS TO
ADMIRAL PIETT.

				PIETT
LORD VADER.

				VADER
		YES, ADMIRAL, WHAT IS IT?

THE ADMIRAL IS SCARED, HIS FACE WHITE AS A SHEET.

				PIETT
		THE EMPEROR COMMANDS YOU MAKE
		CONTACT WITH HIM.

				VADER
		MOVE THE SHIP OUT OF THE ASTEROID
		FIELD SO THAT WE CAN SEND A CLEAR
		TRANSMISSION.

				PIETT
		YES, MY LORD.

EXT. ASTEROID FIELD - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

VADER'S IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER MOVES AGAINST THE VAST SEA OF STARS
AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE FLEET.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

THE DARK LORD, DARTH VADER, IS ALONE IN HIS CHAMBER.  A STRANGE SOUND
ENTERS THE ROOM AND A LIGHT BEGINS TO PLAY ACROSS VADER'S BLACK FIGURE.
HE LOOKS UP AND BOWS QUICKLY.

A TWELVE-FOOT HOLOGRAM OF THE GALACTIC EMPEROR MATERIALIZES BEFORE
VADER.  THE EMPEROR'S DARK ROBES AND MONK'S HOOD ARE REMINISCENT OF THE
CLOAK WORN BY BEN KENOBI.  HIS VOICE IS EVEN DEEPER AND MORE
FRIGHTENING THAN VADER'S.

				VADER
		WHAT IS THY BIDDING, MY MASTER?

				EMPEROR
		THERE IS A GREAT DISTURBANCE IN
		THE FORCE.

				VADER
		I HAVE FELT IT.

				EMPEROR
		WE HAVE A NEW ENEMY - LUKE
		SKYWALKER.

				VADER
		YES, MY MASTER.

				EMPEROR
		HE COULD DESTROY US.

				VADER
		HE'S JUST A BOY.  OBI-WAN CAN NO
		LONGER HELP HIM.

				EMPEROR
		THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH HIM.  THE
		SON OF SKYWALKER MUST NOT BECOME A
		JEDI.

				VADER
		IF HE COULD BE TURNED, HE WOULD
		BECOME A POWERFUL ALLY.

				EMPEROR
		YES.  YES.  HE WOULD BE A GREAT
		ASSET.  CAN IT BE DONE?

				VADER
		HE WILL JOIN US OR DIE, MY
		MASTER.

VADER KNEELS.  THE SUPREME EMPEROR PASSES A HAND OVER THE CROUCHED LORD
OF THE SITH AND FADES AWAY.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A HEAVY DOWNPOUR OF RAIN POUNDS THROUGH THE GNARLED TREES.  A STRANGE
BAROQUE MUD HOUSE SITS ON A MOSS-COVERED KNOLL ON THE EDGE OF A SMALL
LAGOON.  THE SMALL, GNOMISH STRUCTURE RADIATES A WARM GLOW FROM ITS
THICK GLASS WINDOWS.  AS RAIN TAP-DANCES A MERRY TUNE ON ARTOO'S HEAD,
THE STUBBY LITTLE DROID RISES UP ON HIS TIP-TOES TO PEEK INTO ONE OF
THE GLOWING PORTALS.

INT. CREATURE'S HOUSE

ARTOO, PEEKING IN THE WINDOW, SEES THE INSIDE OF THE HOUSE - A VERY
PLAIN, BUT COZY DWELLING.  EVERYTHING IS IN THE SAME SMALL SCALE AS THE
CREATURE.  THE ONLY THING OUT OF PLACE IN THE MINIATURE ROOM IS LUKE,
WHOSE HEIGHT MAKES THE FOUR-FOOT CEILING SEEM EVEN LOWER.  HE SITS
CROSS-LEGGED ON THE FLOOR OF THE LIVING ROOM.

THE CREATURE IS IN AN ADJOINING AREA - HIS LITTLE KITCHEN - COOKING UP
AN INCREDIBLE MEAL.  THE STOVE IS A STEAMING HODGEPODGE OF POTS AND
PANS.  THE WIZENED LITTLE HOST SCURRIES ABOUT CHOPPING THIS, SHREDDING
THAT, AND SHOWERING EVERYTHING WITH EXOTIC HERBS AND SPICES.  HE RUSHES
BACK AND FORTH PUTTING PLATTERS ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF LUKE, WHO
WATCHES THE CREATURE IMPATIENTLY.

				LUKE
		LOOK, I'M SURE IT'S DELICIOUS.
		I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE
		CAN'T SEE YODA NOW.

				CREATURE
		PATIENCE!  FOR THE JEDI IT IS
		TIME TO EAT AS WELL.  EAT, EAT.
		HOT.  GOOD FOOD, HM? GOOD, HMM?

MOVING WITH SOME DIFFICULTY IN THE CRAMPED QUARTERS, LUKE SITS DOWN
NEAR THE FIRE AND SERVES HIMSELF FROM THE POT.  TASTING THE UNFAMILIAR
CONCOCTION, HE IS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.

				LUKE
		HOW FAR AWAY IS YODA?  WILL IT
		TAKE US LONG TO GET THERE?

				CREATURE
		NOT FAR.  YODA NOT FAR.  PATIENCE.
		SOON YOU WILL BE WITH HIM.
			(TASTING FOOD FROM
			 THE POT)
		ROOTLEAF, I COOK.  WHY WISH YOU
		BECOME JEDI?  HM?

				LUKE
		MOSTLY BECAUSE OF MY FATHER, I
		GUESS.

				CREATURE
		AH, YOUR FATHER.  POWERFUL JEDI
		WAS HE, POWERFUL JEDI, MMM.

				LUKE
			(A LITTLE ANGRY)
		OH, COME ON.  HOW COULD YOU KNOW
		MY FATHER?  YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
		WHO I AM.
			(FED UP)
		OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
		HERE.  WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME.

THE CREATURE TURNS AWAY FROM LUKE AND SPEAKS TO A THIRD PARTY.

				CREATURE
			(IRRITATED)
		I CANNOT TEACH HIM.  THE BOY HAS
		NO PATIENCE.

LUKE'S HEAD SPINS IN THE DIRECTION THE CREATURE FACES.  BUT THERE IS NO
ONE THERE.  THE BOY IS BEWILDERED, BUT IT GRADUALLY DAWNS ON HIM THAT
THE LITTLE CREATURE IS YODA, THE JEDI MASTER, AND THAT HE IS SPEAKING
WITH BEN.

				BEN'S VOICE
		HE WILL LEARN PATIENCE.

				YODA
		HMMM.  MUCH ANGER IN HIM, LIKE HIS FATHER.

				BEN'S VOICE
		WAS I ANY DIFFERENT WHEN YOU
		TAUGHT ME?

				YODA
		HAH.  HE IS NOT READY.

				LUKE
		YODA!  I AM READY.  I... BEN!  I
		CAN BE A JEDI.  BEN, TELL HIM I'M
		READY.

TRYING TO SEE BEN, LUKE STARTS TO GET UP BUT HITS HIS HEAD ON THE LOW
CEILING.

				YODA
		READY, ARE YOU?  WHAT KNOW YOU
		OF READY?  FOR EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS
		HAVE I TRAINED JEDI.  MY OWN COUNSEL
		WILL I KEEP ON WHO IS TO BE TRAINED!
		A JEDI MUST HAVE THE DEEPEST
		COMMITMENT, THE MOST SERIOUS MIND.
			(TO THE INVISIBLE
			 BEN, INDICATING LUKE)
		THIS ONE A LONG TIME HAVE I WATCHED.
		ALL HIS LIFE HAS HE LOOKED AWAY...
		TO THE FUTURE, TO THE HORIZON.
		NEVER HIS MIND ON WHERE HE WAS.
		HMM?  WHAT HE WAS DOING.  HMPH.
		ADVENTURE.  HEH!  EXCITEMENT.  HEH!
		A JEDI CRAVES NOT THESE THINGS.
			(TURNING TO LUKE)
		YOU ARE RECKLESS!

LUKE LOOKS DOWN.  HE KNOWS IT IS TRUE.

				BEN'S VOICE
		SO WAS I, IF YOU'LL REMEMBER.

				YODA
		HE IS TOO OLD.  YES, TOO OLD TO
		BEGIN THE TRAINING.

LUKE THINKS HE DETECTS A SUBTLE SOFTENING IN YODA'S VOICE.

				LUKE
		BUT I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH.

YODA TURNS HIS PIERCING GAZE ON LUKE, AS THOUGH THE JEDI MASTER'S HUGE
EYES COULD SOMEHOW DETERMINE HOW MUCH THE BOY HAD LEARNED.  AFTER A
LONG MOMENT, THE LITTLE JEDI TURNS TOWARD WHERE HE ALONE SEES BEN.

				YODA
			(SIGHS)
		WILL HE FINISHED WHAT HE BEGINS?

				LUKE
		I WON'T FAIL YOU - I'M NOT AFRAID.

				YODA
			(TURNS SLOWLY TOWARD
			 HIM)
		OH, YOU WILL BE.  YOU WILL BE.

EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYERS - ASTEROID FIELD

THE IMPERIAL FLEET AROUND VADER'S SHIP IS SURROUNDED BY THE ASTEROID
STORM.  ASTEROIDS BIG AND SMALL PELT THE VAST EXTERIORS OF THE MENACING
SHIPS.  ONE OF THE SMALLER IMPERIAL VESSELS IS HIT BY A HUGE ASTEROID
AND EXPLODES IN A BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

THE COCKPIT IS QUIET AND LIT ONLY BY THE INDICATOR LIGHTS ON THE
CONTROL PANEL.  PRINCESS LEIA SITS IN THE PILOT'S SEAT.

SHE RUNS HER HAND ACROSS THE CONTROL PANEL AS SHE THINKS OF HAN AND THE
CONFUSION HE HAS CREATED WITHIN HER.  SUDDENLY, SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE
COCKPIT WINDOW CATCHES HER EYE.  THE REFLECTION OF THE PANEL LIGHTS
OBSCURES HER VISION UNTIL A SOFT SUCTIONLIKE CUP ATTACHES ITSELF TO THE
WINDSCREEN.  LEIA
MOVES CLOSER TO SEE WHAT IT MIGHT BE.  LARGE, YELLOW EYES FLASH OPEN
AND STARE BACK AT HER.  STARTLED, SHE JUMPS BACK INTO HER SEAT, HER
HEART POUNDING.  THERE IS A SCURRY OF FEET AND A LOUD SCREECH, AND IN
AN INSTANT THE EYES ARE GONE.  THE YOUNG PRINCESS CATCHES HER BREATH,
JUMPS OUT OF HER CHAIR, AND RACES FROM THE COCKPIT.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA

THE LIGHTS GO BRIGHT FOR A SECOND THEN OUT AGAIN.  THREEPIO AND
CHEWBACCA WATCH AS HAN FINISHES WITH SOME WIRES.

				THREEPIO
		SIR, IF I MAY VENTURE AN OPINION...

				HAN
		I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN YOUR
		OPINION, THREEPIO.

LEIA RUSHES INTO THE CABIN JUST AS HAN DROPS THE FINAL FLOOR PANEL INTO
PLACE.

				LEIA
			(OUT OF BREATH)
		THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE.

				HAN
		WHERE?

				LEIA
		OUTSIDE, IN THE CAVE.

AS SHE SPEAKS, THERE COMES A SHARP BANGING ON THE HULL.  CHEWIE LOOKS
UP AND BARKS ANXIOUSLY.

				THREEPIO
		THERE IT IS.  LISTEN!  LISTEN!

				HAN
		I'M GOING OUT THERE.

				LEIA
		ARE YOU CRAZY?!

				HAN
		I JUST GOT THIS BUCKET BACK
		TOGETHER.  I'M NOT GOING TO LET
		SOMETHING TEAR IT APART.

HE AND CHEWIE GRAB THEIR BREATH MASKS OFF A RACK AND HURRY OUT.  LEIA
FOLLOWS.

				LEIA
		THEN I'M GOING WITH YOU.

				THREEPIO
		I THINK IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF I
		STAY HERE AND GUARD THE SHIP.
			(HEARS ANOTHER
			 MYSTERIOUS NOISE)
		OH, NO.

EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

IT IS VERY DARK INSIDE THE HUGE ASTEROID CAVE, TOO DARK TO SEE WHAT IS
ATTACKING THE SHIP.

LEIA STAMPS HER FOOT ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAVE.

				LEIA
		THIS GROUND SURE FEELS STRANGE.
		IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ROCK AT ALL.

HAN KNEELS AND STUDIES THE GROUND, THEN ATTEMPTS TO STUDY THE OUTLINE
OF THE CAVE.

				HAN
		THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF MOISTURE
		IN HERE.

				LEIA
		I DON'T KNOW.  I HAVE A BAD FEELING
		ABOUT THIS.

				HAN
		YEAH.

CHEWIE BARKS THROUGH HIS FACE MASK, AND POINTS TOWARD THE SHIP'S
COCKPIT.  A FIVE-FOOT-LONG SHAPE CAN BE SEEN MOVING ACROSS THE TOP OF
THE FALCON.  THE LEATHERY CREATURE LETS OUT A SCREECH AS HAN BLASTS IT
WITH A LASER BOLT.

				HAN
			(TO LEIA)
		WATCH OUT!

THE BLACK SHAPE TUMBLES OFF THE SPACESHIP AND ONTO THE GROUND IN FRONT
OF THE PRINCESS.  HAN BENDS DOWN TO INVESTIGATE THE DEAD CREATURE.

				HAN
		YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
		MYNOCK.  CHEWIE, CHECK THE REST
		OF THE SHIP, MAKE SURE THERE
		AREN'T ANY MORE ATTACHED.  THEY'RE
		CHEWING ON THE POWER CABLES.

				LEIA
		MYNOCKS?

				HAN
		GO ON INSIDE.  WE'LL CLEAN THEM
		OFF IF THERE ARE ANY MORE.

JUST THEN, A SWARM OF THE UGLY CREATURES SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR.  LEIA
PUTS HER ARMS OVER HER HEAD TO PROTECT HERSELF AS SHE RUNS TOWARD THE
SHIP.  CHEWIE SHOOS ANOTHER MYNOCK AWAY WITH HIS BLASTER.  SEVERAL OF
THE BATLIKE CREATURES FLAP THEIR WINGS LOUDLY AGAINST THE COCKPIT
WINDOW OF THE FALCON.  INSIDE, THREEPIO SHUDDERS AT THEIR PRESENCE.

				THREEPIO
		OHHH!  GO AWAY!  GO AWAY!  BEASTLY
		LITTLE THING.  SHOO!  SHOO!

HAN LOOKS AROUND THE STRANGE, DRIPPING CAVE.

				HAN
		WAIT A MINUTE...

HE UNHOLSTERS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE HUGE CAVE.
THE CAVERN BEGINS TO SHAKE AND THE GROUND STARTS TO BUCKLE.

CHEWIE BARKS AND MOVES FOR THE SHIP, FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY LEIA AND HAN.
THE LARGE WINGS OF THE MYNOCKS FLAP PAST THEM AS THEY PROTECT THEIR
FACES AND RUN UP THE PLATFORM.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ENTRY AREA

AS SOON AS HAN AND LEIA ARE ON BOARD, CHEWIE CLOSES THE MAIN HATCH.
THE SHIP CONTINUES TO SHAKE AND HEAVE.

				HAN
		ALL RIGHT, CHEWIE, LET'S GET
		OUT OF HERE!

THE WOOKIEE HEADS FOR THE COCKPIT AS HAN, FOLLOWED BY THREEPIO, RUSHES
TO THE HOLD AREA AND CHECKS THE SCOPES ON THE CONTROL PANEL.  LEIA
HURRIES AFTER.

				LEIA
		THE EMPIRE IS STILL OUT THERE.
		I DON'T THINK IT'S WISE TO...

HAN RUSHES PAST HER AND HEADS FOR THE COCKPIT.

				HAN
			(INTERRUPTING)
		NO TIME TO DISCUSS THIS IN
		COMMITTEE.

AND WITH THAT HE IS GONE.  THE MAIN ENGINES OF THE FALCON BEGIN TO
WHINE.  LEIA RACES AFTER HIM, BOUNCING AROUND IN THE SHAKING SHIP.

				LEIA
			(ANGRY)
		I AM NOT A COMMITTEE!

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

HAN IS ALREADY IN THE PILOT'S SEAT PULLING BACK ON THE THROTTLE.  THE
CAVE-QUAKE HAS GREATLY DIMINISHED.

				LEIA
		YOU CAN'T MAKE THE JUMP TO LIGHT-
		SPEED IN THIS ASTEROID FIELD...

				HAN
		SIT DOWN, SWEETHEART.  WE'RE
		TAKING OFF!

AS THE SHIP BEGINS TO MOVE FORWARD, CHEWIE BARKS.  HE NOTICES SOMETHING
OUT THE WINDOW AHEAD.  THREEPIO SEES IT TOO.

				THREEPIO
		LOOK!

				HAN
		I SEE IT, I SEE IT.

SUDDENLY, A ROW OF JAGGED WHITE STALAGMITES AND STALACTITES CAN BE SEEN
SURROUNDING THE ENTRANCE.  AND AS THE FALCON MOVES FORWARD, THE
ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE GROWS EVER SMALLER.  HAN PULLS HARD ON THE
THROTTLE, SENDING HIS SHIP SURGING FORWARD.

				THREEPIO
		WE'RE DOOMED!

				LEIA
		THE CAVE IS COLLAPSING.

				HAN
		THIS IS NO CAVE.

				LEIA
		WHAT?

LEIA'S MOUTH DROPS OPEN .  SHE SEES THAT THE ROCKS OF THE CAVE ENTRANCE
ARE NOT ROCKS AT ALL, BUT GIANT TEETH, QUICKLY CLOSING AROUND THE TINY
SHIP.  CHEWIE HOWLS.

INT. SPACE SLUG MOUTH

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON, ZOOMING THROUGH THE MONSTER'S MOUTH, ROLLS ON
ITS SIDE AND BARELY MAKES IT BETWEEN TWO OF THE GIGANTIC WHITE TEETH
BEFORE THE HUGE JAWS SLAMS CLOSED.

EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - GIANT ASTEROID

THE ENORMOUS SPACE SLUG MOVES ITS HEAD OUT OF THE CAVE AS THE FALCON
FLIES OUT OF ITS MOUTH.  THE MONSTER TILTS ITS HEAD, WATCHING THE
STARSHIP FLY AWAY.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID

THE FALCON RACES OUT OF THE ASTEROID CRATER AND INTO THE DEADLY RAIN OF
THE ASTEROID STORM.

EXT. DAGOBAH - DAY

WITH YODA STRAPPED TO HIS BACK, LUKE CLIMBS UP ONE OF THE MANY THICK
VINES THAT GROW IN THE SWAMP.  PANTING HEAVILY, HE CONTINUES HIS COURSE
- CLIMBING, FLIPPING THROUGH THE AIR, JUMPING OVER ROOTS, AND RACING IN
AND OUT OF THE HEAVY GROUND FOG.

				YODA
		RUN!  YES.  A JEDI'S STRENGTH
		FLOWS FROM THE FORCE.  BUT BEWARE
		OF THE DARK SIDE.  ANGER... FEAR...
		AGGRESSION.  THE DARK SIDE OF
		THE FORCE ARE THEY.
		EASILY THEY FLOW, QUICK TO JOIN
		YOU IN A FIGHT.  IF ONCE YOU
		START DOWN THE DARK PATH, FOREVER
		WILL IT DOMINATE YOUR DESTINY,
		CONSUME YOU IT WILL, AS IT DID
		OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.

				LUKE
		VADER.  IS THE DARK SIDE STRONGER?

				YODA
		NO... NO... NO.  QUICKER, EASIER,
		MORE SEDUCTIVE.

				LUKE
		BUT HOW AM I TO KNOW THE GOOD SIDE
		FROM THE BAD?

				YODA
		YOU WILL KNOW.  WHEN YOU ARE CALM,
		AT PEACE.  PASSIVE.  A JEDI USES
		THE FORCE FOR KNOWLEDGE AND
		DEFENSE, NEVER FOR ATTACK.

				LUKE
		BUT TELL ME WHY I CAN'T...

				YODA
			(INTERRUPTING)
		NO, NO, THERE IS NO WHY.  NOTHING
		MORE WILL I TEACH YOU TODAY.
		CLEAR YOUR MIND OF QUESTIONS.
		MMM.  MMMMMMMM.

ARTOO BEEPS IN THE DISTANCE AS LUKE LETS YODA DOWN TO THE GROUND.
BREATHING HEAVILY, HE TAKES HIS SHIRT FROM A NEARBY TREE BRANCH AND
PULLS IT ON.

HE TURNS TO SEE A HUGE, DEAD, BLACK TREE, ITS BASE SURROUNDED BY A FEW
FEET OF WATER.  GIANT, TWISTED ROOTS FORM A DARK AND SINISTER CAVE ON
ONE SIDE.  LUKE STARES AT THE TREE, TREMBLING.

				LUKE
		THERE'S SOMETHING NOT RIGHT HERE.

YODA SITS ON A LARGE ROOT, POKING HIS GIMER STICK INTO THE DIRT.

				LUKE
		I FEEL COLD, DEATH.

				YODA
		THAT PLACE... IS STRONG WITH THE
		DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE.  A DOMAIN
		OF EVIL IT IS.  IN YOU MUST GO.

				LUKE
		WHAT'S IN THERE?

				YODA
		ONLY WHAT YOU TAKE WITH YOU.

LUKE LOOKS WARILY BETWEEN THE TREE AND YODA.  HE STARTS TO STRAP ON HIS
WEAPON BELT.

				YODA
		YOUR WEAPONS... YOU WILL NOT
		NEED THEM.

LUKE GIVES THE TREE A LONG LOOK, THAN SHAKES HIS HEAD "NO."  YODA
SHRUGS.  LUKE REACHES UP TO BRUSH ASIDE SOME HANGING VINES AND ENTERS
THE TREE.

INT. DAGOBAH - TREE CAVE

LUKE MOVES INTO THE ALMOST TOTAL DARKNESS OF THE WET AND SLIMY CAVE.
THE YOUTH CAN BARELY MAKE OUT THE EDGE OF THE PASSAGE.  HOLDING HIS LIT
SABER BEFORE HIM, HE SEES A LIZARD CRAWLING UP THE SIDE OF THE CAVE AND
A SNAKE WRAPPED AROUND THE BRANCHES OF A TREE.  LUKE DRAWS A DEEP
BREATH, THEN PUSHES DEEPER INTO THE CAVE.

THE SPACE WIDENS AROUND HIM, BUT HE FEELS THAT RATHER THAN SEES IT.
HIS SWORD CASTS THE ONLY LIGHT AS HE PEERS INTO THE DARKNESS.  IT IS
VERY QUIET HERE.

THEN, A LOUD HISS! DARTH VADER APPEARS ACROSS THE BLACKNESS,
ILLUMINATED BY HIS OWN JUST-IGNITED LASER SWORD.  IMMEDIATELY, HE
CHARGES LUKE, SABER HELD HIGH.  HE IS UPON THE YOUTH IN SECONDS, BUT
LUKE SIDESTEPS PERFECTLY AND SLASHES AT VADER WITH HIS SWORD.

VADER IS DECAPITATED.  HIS HELMET-ENCASED HEAD FLIES FROM HIS SHOULDERS
AS HIS BODY DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS.  THE METALLIC BANGING OF THE
HELMET FILLS THE CAVE AS VADER'S HEAD SPINS AND BOUNCES, SMASHES ON THE
FLOOR, AND FINALLY STOPS. FOR AN INSTANT IT RESTS ON THE FLOOR, THEN IT
CRACKS VERTICALLY.  THE BLACK HELMET AND BREATH MASK FALL AWAY TO
REVEAL... LUKE'S HEAD.

ACROSS THE SPACE, THE STANDING LUKE GASPS AT THE SIGHT, WIDE-EYED IN
TERROR.

THE DECAPITATED HEAD FADES AWAY, AS IN A VISION.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CAVE - DUSK

MEANWHILE, YODA SITS ON THE ROOT, CALMLY LEANING ON HIS GIMER STICK.

EXT. SPACE - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

VADER'S IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER MOVES THROUGH SPACE, GUARDED BY ITS
CONVOY OF TIE FIGHTERS.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - CONTROL DECK

VADER STANDS IN THE BACK CONTROL AREA OF HIS SHIP'S BRIDGE WITH A
MOTLEY GROUP OF MEN AND CREATURES.  ADMIRAL PIETT AND TWO CONTROLLERS
STAND AT THE FRONT OF THE BRIDGE AND WATCH THE GROUP WITH SCORN.

				PIETT
		BOUNTY HUNTERS.  WE DON'T NEED
		THAT SCUM.

				FIRST CONTROLLER
		YES, SIR.

				PIETT
		THOSE REBELS WON'T ESCAPE US.

A SECOND CONTROLLER INTERRUPTS.

				SECOND CONTROLLER
		SIR, WE HAVE A PRIORITY SIGNAL
		FROM THE STAR DESTROYER AVENGER.

				PIETT
		RIGHT.

THE GROUP STANDING BEFORE VADER IS A BIZARRE ARRAY OF GALACTIC FORTUNE
HUNTERS  THERE IS BOSSK, A SLIMY, TENTACLED MONSTER WITH TWO HUGE,
BLOODSHOT EYES IN A SOFT BAGGY FACE; ZUCKUSS AND DENGAR, TWO BATTLE-
SCARRED, MANGY HUMAN TYPES; IG-88, A BATTERED, TARNISHED CHROME WAR
DROID; AND BOBA FETT, A MAN IN A WEAPON-COVERED ARMORED SPACE SUIT.

				VADER
		... THERE WILL BE A SUBSTANTIAL
		REWARD FOR THE ONE WHO FINDS THE
		MILLENNIUM FALCON.  YOU ARE FREE
		TO USE ANY METHODS NECESSARY, BUT
		I WANT THEM ALIVE.  NO DISINTEGRATIONS.

				BOBA FETT
		AS YOU WISH.

AT THAT MOMENT, ADMIRAL PIETT APPROACHES VADER IN A RUSH OF EXCITEMENT.

				PIETT
		LORD VADER!  MY LORD, WE HAVE
		THEM.

EXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID BELT

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON SPEEDS THROUGH DEEP SPACE, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A
FIRING IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER.  A LARGE ASTEROID ABOUT THE SAME SIZE
AS THE FALCON TUMBLES RAPIDLY TOWARD THE STARSHIP.  THE TINY FALCON
BANKS TO AVOID THE GIANT ASTEROID AS SMALLER ROCKS PELT ITS SURFACE.
THEN THE SMALL CRAFT ROARS UNDER THE ASTEROID WHICH EXPLODES HARMLESSLY
ON THE HULL OF THE VAST STAR DESTROYER.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

THE SHIP SHUDDERS AS FLAK EXPLODES NEAR THE COCKPIT WINDOW.  THREEPIO
CHECKS A TRACKING SCOPE AN THE SIDE CONTROL PANEL WHILE LEIA WATCHES
TENSELY OUT THE WINDOW.

				THREEPIO
		OH, THANK GOODNESS WE'RE COMING
		OUT OF THE ASTEROID FIELD.

CHEWIE BARKS EXCITEDLY AS THE RAIN OF ASTEROIDS BEGINS TO SUBSIDE.  A
BOLT FROM THE STAR DESTROYER SETS UP A FIERY EXPLOSION ON THE BACK SIDE
OF THE FALCON, CAUSING IT TO LURCH TO ONE SIDE.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID FIELD

THE FALCON IS HIT HARD BY ANOTHER BOLT FROM THE STAR DESTROYER WHICH
CREATES A HUGE EXPLOSION NEAR THE COCKPIT OF THE SMALLER SHIP.  THE
FALCON TILTS STEEPLY, THEN RIGHTS ITSELF.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

HAN CORRECTS THE ANGLE OF HIS SHIP.

				HAN
		LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.  READY FOR
		LIGHT-SPEED?  ONE... TWO... THREE!

HAN PULLS BACK ON THE HYPERSPACE THROTTLE AND - NOTHING HAPPENS.  FLAK
BURSTS CONTINUE TO ROCK THE SHIP.

				HAN
			(FRANTIC)
		IT'S NOT FAIR!

CHEWIE IS VERY ANGRY AND STARTS TO GROWL AND BARK AT HIS FRIEND AND
CAPTAIN.  AGAIN, HAN DESPERATELY PULLS BACK ON THE THROTTLE.

				HAN
		THE TRANSFER CIRCUITS ARE WORKING.
		IT'S NOT MY FAULT!

CHEWIE PUTS HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS, WHINING.

				LEIA
			(ALMOST EXPECTING
			 IT)
		NO LIGHT-SPEED?

				HAN
		IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

				THREEPIO
		SIR, WE JUST LOST THE MAIN REAR
		DEFLECTOR SHIELD.  ONE MORE DIRECT
		HIT ON THE BACK QUARTER AND WE'RE
		DONE FOR.

HAN PAUSES FOR A MOMENT, MAKES A DECISION, AND PULLS BACK ON A LEVER.

				HAN
		TURN HER AROUND.

CHEWIE BARKS IN PUZZLEMENT.

				HAN
		I SAID TURN HER AROUND!  I'M
		GOING TO PUT ALL POWER IN THE
		FRONT SHIELD.

				LEIA
		YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK THEM?!

				THREEPIO
		SIR, THE ODDS OF SURVIVING A
		DIRECT ASSAULT ON AN IMPERIAL
		STAR DESTROYER...

				LEIA
		SHUT UP!

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID FIELD

THE FALCON BANKS, MAKES A STEEP, TWISTING TURN.  IN THE NEXT MOMENT IT
IS RACING TOWARD THE STAR DESTROYER, LOOKING VERY SMALL AGAINST THE
MASSIVE SURFACE OF THE IMPERIAL SHIP.  AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE SURFACE
OF THE STAR DESTROYER, THE FALCON BOBS AND WEAVES TO AVOID THE NUMEROUS
FLAK BURSTS.

INT. STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - BRIDGE

THE TINY FALCON HEADS DIRECTLY FOR THE AVENGER'S BRIDGE.  THE IMPERIALS
STATIONED THERE ARE STUNNED TO SEE THE SMALL SPACESHIP RACING LOW
ACROSS THE HULL, HEADED DIRECTLY AT THE HUGE WINDOWS OF THE BRIDGE
AREA.  ALARMS GO OFF EVERYWHERE.  THE DESTROYER'S COMMANDER, CAPTAIN
NEEDA, CAN SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES.

				NEEDA
		THEY'RE MOVING TO ATTACK
		POSITION!  SHIELDS UP!

NEEDA AND HIS MEN DUCK AS THE FALCON NEARS THE BRIDGE WINDOW.  AT THE
LAST MINUTE, THE FALCON VEERS OFF AND OUT OF SIGHT.  ALL IS QUIET.

				NEEDA
		TRACK THEM.  THEY MAY COME
		AROUND FOR ANOTHER PASS.

				TRACKING OFFICER
		CAPTAIN NEEDA, THE SHIP NO LONGER
		APPEARS ON OUR SCOPES.

				NEEDA
		THEY CAN'T HAVE DISAPPEARED.  NO
		SHIP THAT SMALL HAS A CLOAKING
		DEVICE.

				TRACKING OFFICER
		WELL, THERE'S NO TRACE OF THEM,
		SIR.

				COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
		CAPTAIN, LORD VADER DEMANDS AN
		UPDATE ON THE PURSUIT.

				NEEDA
			(DRAWING A BREATH)
		GET A SHUTTLE READY.  I SHALL
		ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR
		LOSING THEM, AND APOLOGIZE TO LORD
		VADER. MEANWHILE, CONTINUE TO
		SCAN THE AREA.

				COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
		YES, CAPTAIN NEEDA.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DAY

LUKE'S FACE IS UPSIDE-DOWN AND SHOWING ENORMOUS STRAIN.  HE STANDS ON
HIS HANDS, WITH YODA PERCHED ON HIS FEET.  OPPOSITE LUKE AND YODA ARE
TWO ROCKS THE SIZE OF BOWLING BALLS.  LUKE STARES AT THE ROCKS AND
CONCENTRATES.  ONE OF THE ROCKS LIFTS FROM THE GROUND AND FLOATS UP TO
REST ON THE OTHER.

				YODA
		USE THE FORCE.  YES...

YODA TAPS LUKE'S LEG.  QUICKLY, LUKE LIFTS ONE HAND FROM THE GROUND.
HIS BODY WAVERS, BUT HE MAINTAINS HIS BALANCE.  ARTOO, STANDING NEARBY,
IS WHISTLING AND BEEPING FRANTICALLY.

				YODA
		NOW... THE STONE.  FEEL IT.

LUKE CONCENTRATES ON TRYING TO LIFT THE TOP ROCK.  IT RISES A FEW FEET,
SHAKING UNDER THE STRAIN.  BUT, DISTRACTED BY ARTOO'S FRANTIC BEEPING,
LUKE LOSES HIS BALANCE AND FINALLY COLLAPSES.  YODA JUMPS CLEAR.

				YODA
		CONCENTRATE!

ANNOYED AT THE DISTURBANCE, LUKE LOOKS OVER AT ARTOO, WHO IS ROCKING
URGENTLY BACK AND FORTH IN FRONT OF HIM.

ARTOO WADDLES CLOSER TO LUKE, CHIRPING WILDLY, THEN SCOOTS OVER THE
EDGE OF THE SWAMP.  CATCHING ON, LUKE RUSHES TO THE WATER'S EDGE.  THE
X-WING FIGHTER HAS SUNK, AND ONLY THE TIP OF ITS NOSE SHOWS ABOVE THE
LAKE'S SURFACE.

				LUKE
		OH, NO.  WE'LL NEVER GET IT OUT
		NOW.

YODA STAMPS HIS FOOT IN IRRITATION.

				YODA
		SO CERTAIN ARE YOU.  ALWAYS WITH
		YOU IT CANNOT BE DONE.  HEAR YOU
		NOTHING THAT I SAY?

LUKE LOOKS UNCERTAINLY OUT AT THE SHIP.

				LUKE
		MASTER, MOVING STONES AROUND IS
		ONE THING.  THIS IS TOTALLY
		DIFFERENT.

				YODA
		NO!  NO DIFFERENT!  ONLY DIFFERENT
		IN YOUR MIND.  YOU MUST UNLEARN
		WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED.

				LUKE
			(FOCUSING, QUIETLY)
		ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

				YODA
		NO!  TRY NOT.  DO.  OR DO NOT.
		THERE IS NO TRY.

LUKE CLOSES HIS EYES AND CONCENTRATES ON THINKING THE SHIP OUT.

SLOWLY, THE X-WING'S NOSE BEGINS TO RISE ABOVE THE WATER.  IT HOVERS
FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SLIDES BACK, DISAPPEARING ONCE AGAIN.

				LUKE
			(PANTING HEAVILY)
		I CAN'T.  IT'S TOO BIG.

				YODA
		SIZE MATTERS NOT.  LOOK AT ME.
		JUDGE ME BY MY SIZE, DO YOU?
		HM?  MMMM.

LUKE SHAKES HIS HEAD.

				YODA
		AND WELL YOU SHOULD NOT.  FOR MY
		ALLY IN THE FORCE.  AND A POWERFUL
		ALLY IT IS.  LIFE CREATES IT, MAKES
		IT GROW.  ITS ENERGY SURROUNDS US
		AND BINDS US.  LUMINOUS BEINGS
		ARE WE...
			(YODA PINCHES
			 LUKE'S SHOULDER)
		... NOT THIS CRUDE MATTER.
			(A SWEEPING GESTURE)
		YOU MUST FEEL THE FORCE AROUND YOU.
			(GESTURING)
		HERE, BETWEEN YOU... ME... THE
		TREE... THE ROCK... EVERYWHERE!
		YES, EVEN BETWEEN THIS LAND AND
		THAT SHIP!

				LUKE
			(DISCOURAGED)
		YOU WANT THE IMPOSSIBLE.

QUIETLY YODA TURNS TOWARD THE X-WING FIGHTER.  WITH HIS EYES CLOSED AND
HIS HEAD BOWED, HE RAISES HIS ARM AND POINTS AT THE SHIP.

SOON, THE FIGHTER RISES ABOVE THE WATER AND MOVES FORWARD AS ARTOO
BEEPS IN TERROR AND SCOOTS AWAY.

THE ENTIRE X-WING MOVES MAJESTICALLY, SURELY, TOWARD THE SHORE.  YODA
STANDS ON A TREE ROOT AND GUIDES THE FIGHTER CAREFULLY DOWN TOWARD THE
BEACH.

LUKE STARES IN ASTONISHMENT AS THE FIGHTER SETTLES DOWN ONTO THE SHORE.
HE WALKS TOWARD YODA.

				LUKE
		I DON'T... I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

				YODA
		THAT IS WHY YOU FAIL.

LUKE SHAKES HIS HEAD, BEWILDERED.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

THE FLEET AROUND VADER'S STAR DESTROYER NOW INCLUDES NEEDA'S STAR
DESTROYER, THE AVENGER.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				VADER
		APOLOGY ACCEPTED, CAPTAIN NEEDA.

CLUTCHING DESPERATELY AT HIS THROAT, CAPTAIN NEEDA SLUMPS DOWN, THEN
FALLS OVER ON HIS BACK, AT THE FEET OF DARTH VADER.  TWO STORMTROOPERS
PICK UP THE LIFELESS BODY AND CARRY IT QUICKLY AWAY AS ADMIRAL PIETT
AND TWO OF HIS CAPTAINS HURRY UP TO THE DARK LORD.

				PIETT
		LORD VADER, OUR SHIPS HAVE
		COMPLETED THEIR SCAN OF THE AREA
		AND FOUND NOTHING.  IF THE
		MILLENNIUM FALCON WENT INTO LIGHT-
		SPEED, IT'LL BE ON THE OTHER SIDE
		OF THE GALAXY BY NOW.

				VADER
		ALERT ALL COMMANDS.  CALCULATE
		EVERY POSSIBLE DESTINATION ALONG
		THEIR LAST KNOW TRAJECTORY.

				PIETT
		YES, MY LORD.  WE'LL FIND THEM.

				VADER
		DON'T FAIL ME AGAIN, ADMIRAL.

VADER EXITS AS THE ADMIRAL TURNS TO AN AIDE, A LITTLE MORE UNEASY THAN
WHEN HE ARRIVED.

				PIETT
		ALERT ALL COMMANDS.  DEPLOY THE FLEET.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

VADER'S SHIP MOVES AWAY, FLANKED BY ITS FLEET OF SMALLER SHIPS.  THE
AVENGER GLIDES OFF INTO SPACE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  NO ONE ON
THAT SHIP OR ON VADER'S IS AWARE THAT, CLINGING TO THE SIDE OF THE
AVENGER, IS THE PIRATESHIP, THE MILLENNIUM FALCON.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				THREEPIO

		NO, I WILL NOT BE QUIET, CHEWBACCA.
		WHY DOESN'T ANYONE LISTEN TO ME?

				HAN
			(TO CHEWIE)
		THE FLEET IS BEGINNING TO BREAK
		UP.  GO BACK AND STAND BY THE
		MANUAL RELEASE FOR THE LANDING CLAW.

CHEWIE BARKS, STRUGGLES FROM HIS SEAT, AND CLIMBS OUT OF THE CABIN.

				THREEPIO
		I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW THAT IS
		GOING TO HELP.  SURRENDER IS A
		PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE
		IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE
		EMPIRE MAY BE GRACIOUS ENOUGH...

LEIA REACHES OVER AND SHUTS OFF THREEPIO, MID-SENTENCE.

				HAN
		THANK YOU.

				LEIA
		WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND FOR
		YOUR NEXT MOVE?

				HAN
		WELL, IF THEY FOLLOW STANDARD
		IMPERIAL PROCEDURE, THEY'LL DUMP
		THEIR GARBAGE BEFORE THEY GO TO
		LIGHT-SPEED, THEN WE JUST FLOAT
		AWAY.

				LEIA
		WITH THE REST OF THE GARBAGE.
		THEN WHAT?

				HAN
		THEN WE'VE GOT TO FIND A SAFE
		PORT SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.  GOT
		ANY IDEAS?

				LEIA
		NO.  WHERE ARE WE?

		THE ANOAT SYSTEM.

				LEIA
		ANOAT SYSTEM.  THERE'S NOT MUCH
		THERE.

				HAN
		NO.  WELL, WAIT.  THIS IS
		INTERESTING.  LANDO.

HE POINTS TO A COMPUTER MAPSCREEN ON THE CONTROL PANEL.  LEIA SLIPS OUT
OF HER CHAIR AND MOVES NEXT TO THE HANDSOME PILOT.  SMALL LIGHT POINTS
REPRESENTING SEVERAL SYSTEMS FLASH BY ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN.

				LEIA
		LANDO SYSTEM?

				HAN
		LANDO'S NOT A SYSTEM, HE'S A MAN.
		LANDO CALRISSIAN.  HE'S A CARD
		PLAYER, GAMBLER, SCOUNDREL.  YOU'D
		LIKE HIM.

				LEIA
		THANKS.

				HAN
		BESPIN.  IT'S PRETTY FAR, BUT I
		THINK WE CAN MAKE IT.

				LEIA
			(READING FROM THE

		A MINING COLONY?

				HAN
		YEAH, A TIBANNA GAS MINE.  LANDO
		CONNED SOMEBODY OUT OF IT.  WE
		GO BACK A LONG WAY, LANDO AND ME.

				LEIA
		CAN YOU TRUST HIM?

				HAN
		NO.  BUT HE HAS NO LOVE FOR THE
		EMPIRE, I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

CHEWIE BARKS OVER THE INTERCOM.  HAN QUICKLY CHANGES HIS READOUTS AND
STRETCHES TO LOOK OUT THE COCKPIT WINDOW.

				HAN
			(INTO INTERCOM)
		HERE WE GO, CHEWIE.  STAND BY.
		DETACH!

HAN LEANS BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND GIVES LEIA AN INVISIBLE SMILE.  SHE
THINKS FOR A MOMENT, SHAKES HER HEAD; A GRIN CREEPS ACROSS HER FACE AND
SHE GIVES HIM A QUICK KISS.

				LEIA
		YOU DO HAVE YOUR MOMENTS.  NOT
		MANY, BUT YOU HAVE THEM.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

AS THE AVENGER STAR DESTROYER MOVES SLOWLY INTO SPACE, THE HATCH ON ITS
UNDERBELLY OPENS, SENDING A TRAIL OF JUNK BEHIND IT.  HIDDEN AMONG THE
REFUSE, THE FALCON TUMBLES AWAY.  IN THE NEXT MOMENT, THE AVENGER ROARS
OFF INTO HYPERSPACE.  THE FALCON'S ENGINES ARE IGNITED, AND IT RACES
OFF INTO THE DISTANCE.  AMIDST THE SLOWLY DRIFTING JUNK, BOBA FETT'S
SHIP APPEARS AND MOVES AFTER THE FALCON.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - CLEARING - DAY

IN THE CLEARING BEHIND YODA'S HOUSE, LUKE AGAIN STANDS UPSIDE-DOWN, BUT
HIS FACE SHOWS LESS STRAIN AND MORE CONCENTRATION THAN BEFORE.  YODA
SITS ON THE GROUND BELOW THE YOUNG WARRIOR.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
CLEARING, TWO EQUIPMENT CASES SLOWLY RISE INTO THE AIR.  NEARBY ARTOO
WATCHES, HUMMING TO HIMSELF, WHEN SUDDENLY HE, TOO, RISES INTO THE AIR.
HIS LITTLE LEGS KICK DESPERATELY AND HIS HEAD TURNS FRANTICALLY,
LOOKING FOR HELP.

				YODA
		CONCENTRATE... FEEL THE FORCE
		FLOW.  YES.  GOOD.  CALM, YES.
		THROUGH THE FORCE, THINGS YOU
		WILL SEE.  OTHER PLACES.  THE

		LONG GONE.

LUKE SUDDENLY BECOMES DISTRESSED.

				LUKE
		HAN!  LEIA!

THE TWO PACKING BOXES AND ARTOO FALL TO THE GROUND WITH A CRASH, THEN
LUKE HIMSELF TUMBLES OVER.

				YODA
			(SHAKING HIS HEAD)
		HMM.  CONTROL, CONTROL.  YOU MUST
		LEARN CONTROL.

				LUKE
		I SAW... I SAW A CITY IN THE

				YODA
		MMM.  FRIENDS YOU HAVE THERE.

				LUKE
		THEY WERE IN PAIN.

				YODA
IT IS THE FUTURE YOU SEE.

		FUTURE?  WILL THEY DIE?

YODA CLOSES HIS EYES AND LOWERS HIS HEAD.

				YODA
		DIFFICULT TO SEE.  ALWAYS IN
		MOTION IS THE FUTURE.

				LUKE
		I'VE GOT TO GO TO THEM.

				YODA
		DECIDE YOU MUST HOW TO SERVE

SUDDENLY, TWO TWIN-POD CLOUD CARS APPEAR AND MOVE TOWARD THE FALCON.
THE CLOUD CARS DRAW UP ALONGSIDE THE STARSHIP.

CURIOUS, THREEPIO ENTERS THE ROOM.

SMOLDERING MECHANICAL ARMS AND LEGS BOUNCE OFF THE WALLS AS THE DOOR
WHOOSHES CLOSED BEHIND HIM.

LANDO, HAN, AND LEIA CONTINUE DOWN THE CORRIDOR UNAWARE OF THREEPIO'S
DREADFUL ACCIDENT.  CHEWBACCA GLANCES AROUND, SNIFFS THE AIR, BUT
SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS AND FOLLOWS THE GROUP.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DUSK

IN THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF THE FIGHTER, LUKE LOADS A HEAVY CASE INTO THE
BELLY OF THE SHIP.  ARTOO SITS ON TOP OF THE X-WING, SETTLING DOWN INTO
HIS CUBBYHOLE.  YODA STANDS NEARBY ON A LOG.

				YODA
		LUKE!  YOU MUST COMPLETE THE
		TRAINING.

				LUKE
		I CAN'T KEEP THE VISION OUT OF MY
		HEAD.  THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.  I'VE
		GOT TO HELP THEM.

				YODA
		YOU MUST NOT GO!

				LUKE
		BUT HAN AND LEIA WILL DIE IF I
		DON'T.

				BEN'S VOICE
		YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

LUKE LOOKS TOWARD THE VOICE IN AMAZEMENT.  BEN HAS MATERIALIZED AS A
REAL, SLIGHTLY SHIMMERING IMAGE NEAR YODA.  THE POWER OF HIS PRESENCE
STOPS LUKE.

				BEN
		EVEN YODA CANNOT SEE THEIR FATE.

				LUKE
		BUT I CAN HELP THEM!  I FEEL
		THE FORCE!

				BEN
		BUT YOU CANNOT CONTROL IT.  THIS
		IS A DANGEROUS TIME FOR YOU,
		WHEN YOU WILL BE TEMPTED BY THE
		DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE.

				YODA
		YES, YES.  TO OBI-WAN YOU LISTEN.
		THE CAVE.  REMEMBER YOUR FAILURE
		AT THE CAVE!

				LUKE
		BUT I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH SINCE
		THEN.  MASTER YODA, I PROMISE TO
		RETURN AND FINISH WHAT I'VE BEGUN.
		YOU HAVE MY WORD.

				BEN
		IT IS YOU AND YOUR ABILITIES THE
		EMPEROR WANTS.  THAT IS WHY YOUR
		FRIENDS ARE MADE TO SUFFER.

				LUKE
		AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE TO GO.

				BEN
		LUKE, I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU TO
		THE EMPEROR THE WAY I LOST VADER.

				LUKE
		YOU WON'T.

				YODA
		STOPPED THEY MUST BE.  ON THIS
		ALL DEPENDS.  ONLY A FULLY TRAINED
		JEDI KNIGHT WITH THE FORCE AS HIS
		ALLY WILL CONQUER VADER AND HIS
		EMPEROR.  IF YOU END YOUR TRAINING
		NOW, IF YOU CHOOSE THE QUICK AND
		EASY PATH, AS VADER DID, YOU WILL
		BECOME AN AGENT OF EVIL.

				BEN
		PATIENCE.

				LUKE
		AND SACRIFICE HAN AND LEIA?

				YODA
		IF YOU HONOR WHAT THEY FIGHT FOR
		... YES!

LUKE IS IN GREAT ANGUISH.  HE STRUGGLES WITH THE DILEMMA, A BATTLE
RAGING IN HIS MIND.

				BEN
		IF YOU CHOOSE TO FACE VADER, YOU
		WILL DO IT ALONE.  I CANNOT
		INTERFERE.

				LUKE
		I UNDERSTAND.
			(HE MOVES TO HIS
			 X-WING)
		ARTOO, FIRE UP THE CONVERTERS.

ARTOO WHISTLES A HAPPY REPLY.

				BEN
		LUKE, DON'T GIVE IN TO HATE -
		THAT LEADS TO THE DARK SIDE.

LUKE NODS AND CLIMBS INTO HIS SHIP.

				YODA
		STRONG IS VADER.  MIND WHAT YOU
		HAVE LEARNED.  SAVE YOU IT CAN.

				LUKE
		I WILL.  AND I'LL RETURN.  I PROMISE.

ARTOO CLOSES THE COCKPIT.  BEN AND YODA STAND WATCHING AS THE ROAR OF
THE ENGINES AND THE WIND ENGULF THEM.

				YODA
			(SIGHS)
		TOLD YOU, I DID.  RECKLESS IS
		HE.  NOW MATTERS ARE WORSE.

				BEN
		THAT BOY IS OUR LAST HOPE.

				YODA
			(LOOKS UP)
		NO.  THERE IS ANOTHER.

EXT. SPACE - PLANET DAGOBAH

LUKE'S TINY X-WING ROCKETS AWAY FROM THE GREEN PLANET OF DAGOBAH AND
OFF INTO SPACE.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

WITHIN THE QUARTERS ASSIGNED HER ON CLOUD CITY, LEIA PACES IN
AGITATION.  SHE HAS CHANGED FROM HER COLD-WEATHER PANTS AND JACKET TO A
LOVELY DRESS.  HER HAIR IS DOWN, TIED BACK WITH RIBBONS.  SHE MOVES
FROM A LARGE, OPEN WINDOW AND TURNS TO SEE HAN ENTERING THROUGH THE
DOORWAY.

				HAN
		THE SHIP IS ALMOST FINISHED.
		TWO OR THREE MORE THINGS AND
		WE'RE IN GREAT SHAPE.

				LEIA
		THE SOONER THE BETTER.  SOMETHING'S
		WRONG HERE.  NO ONE HAS SEEN OR
		KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THREEPIO.
		HE'S BEEN GONE TOO LONG TO HAVE
		GOTTEN LOST.

HAN TAKES LEIA BY THE SHOULDERS AND GENTLY KISSES HER FOREHEAD.

				HAN
		RELAX.  I'LL TALK TO LANDO AND
		SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT.

				LEIA
		I DON'T TRUST LANDO.

				HAN
		WELL, I DON'T TRUST HIM, EITHER.
		BUT HE IS MY FRIEND.  BESIDES,
		WE'LL SOON BE GONE.

				LEIA
		AND THEN YOU'RE AS GOOD AS GONE,
		AREN'T YOU?

NOT SPEAKING, HAN CONSIDERS HER WORDS AND GAZES AT HER TROUBLED FACE.

INT. CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM

THE ROOM IS PILED HIGH WITH BROKEN AND DISCARDED MACHINE PARTS.  FOUR
UGNAUGHTS, SMALL HOGLIKE CREATURES, SEPARATE THE JUNK AND THROW SOME
PIECES ONTO A CONVEYER BELT WHICH MOVES BRISKLY TOWARD A PIT OF MOLTEN
METAL.  PIECES OF THREEPIO'S GOLDEN BODY MOVE DOWN THE BELT.  CHEWIE
ENTERS THE ROOM AND SPOTS AN UGNAUGHT PICKING UP AND INSPECTING
THREEPIO'S HEAD.  THE WOOKIEE BARKS A COMMAND, STARTLING THE UGNAUGHT,
THEN REACHES TO GRAB THE HEAD.  BUT THE UGNAUGHT TOSSES IT AWAY FROM
HIM TO ANOTHER UGNAUGHT.  THIS GAME OF KEEP-AWAY GOES ON UNTIL
THREEPIO'S HEAD FALLS FROM THEIR GRIP AND BOUNCES WITH A CLANG ONTO THE
GROUND.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

THE DOOR ZAPS OPEN.  CHEWBACCA WALKS IN, CARRYING A PACKING CASE OF
THREEPIO, ARMS AND LEGS HANGING OVER THE EDGE.

				LEIA
		WHAT HAPPENED?

CHEWIE SETS THE CASE ON A TABLE, GRUNTING AND GROANING AN EXPLANATION.

				HAN
		WHERE?  FOUND HIM IN A JUNK PILE?

				LEIA
		OH, WHAT A MESS.  CHEWIE, DO YOU
		THINK YOU CAN REPAIR HIM?

THE GIANT WOOKIEE STUDIES THE ARRAY OF ROBOT PARTS.  HE LOOKS AT THE
PRINCESS AND SHRUGS SADLY.

				HAN
		LANDO'S GOT PEOPLE WHO CAN FIX
		HIM.

				LEIA
		NO, THANKS.

THERE IS A BUZZ AND THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN, REVEALING LANDO.

				LANDO
		I'M SORRY.  AM I INTERRUPTING
		ANYTHING?

				LEIA
		NOT REALLY.

				LANDO
		YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.
		YOU TRULY BELONG HERE WITH US
		AMONG THE CLOUDS.

				LEIA
			(COOLLY)
		THANK YOU.

				LANDO
		WILL YOU JOIN ME FOR A LITTLE
		REFRESHMENT?

HAN LOOKS AT LANDO SUSPICIOUSLY, BUT CHEWIE BARKS AT THE MENTION OF
FOOD AND LICKS HIS LIPS.

				LANDO
		EVERYONE'S INVITED, OF COURSE.

LEIA TAKES LANDO'S PROFFERED ARM, AND THE GROUP TURNS TO GO.  LANDO
SPOTS THREEPIO'S REMAINS.

				LANDO
		HAVING TROUBLE WITH YOU DROID?

HAN AND LEIA EXCHANGE A QUICK GLANCE.

				HAN
		NO.  NO PROBLEM.  WHY?

HAN AND LEIA MOVE ARM-IN-ARM THROUGH THE DOOR, FOLLOWED BY LANDO AND
CHEWIE.  THE DOOR SLIDES CLOSED BEHIND THEM.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

LEIA WALKS BETWEEN HAN AND LANDO AS CHEWIE FOLLOWS A SHORT DISTANCE
BEHIND.  LONG SHAFTS OF LIGHT POUR ACROSS THE CORRIDOR BETWEEN TALL,
PURE-WHITE COLUMNS.

				LANDO
		SO YOU SEE, SINCE WE'RE A SMALL
		OPERATION, WE DON'T FALL INTO
		THE... UH... JURISDICTION OF THE
		EMPIRE.

				LEIA
		SO YOU'RE PART OF THE MINING
		GUILD THEN?

				LANDO
		NO, NOT ACTUALLY.  OUR OPERATION
		IS SMALL ENOUGH NOT TO BE NOTICED...
		WHICH IS ADVANTAGEOUS FOR EVERYBODY
		SINCE OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ANXIOUS
		TO AVOID ATTRACTING ATTENTION TO
		THEMSELVES.

THE GROUP WALKS INTO ANOTHER CORRIDOR AND HEADS FOR A HUGE DOORWAY AT
THE FAR END.

				HAN
		AREN'T YOU AFRAID THE EMPIRE'S
		GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS
		LITTLE OPERATION AND SHUT YOU DOWN?

				LANDO
		THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A DANGER LOOMING
		LIKE A SHADOW OVER EVERYTHING WE'VE
		BUILT HERE.  BUT THINGS HAVE
		DEVELOPED THAT WILL INSURE SECURITY.
		I'VE JUST MADE A DEAL THAT WILL
		KEEP THE EMPIRE OUT OF HERE FOREVER.

INT. CLOUD CITY - DINING ROOM

THE MIGHTY DOORS TO THE DINING ROOM SLIDE OPEN AND THE GROUP ENTERS THE
DINING ROOM.  AT THE FAR END OF A HUGE BANQUET TABLE SITS DARTH VADER.
STANDING AT HIS SIDE AND SLIGHTLY BEHIND HIM IS BOBA FETT, THE BOUNTY
HUNTER.

FASTER THAN THE WINK OF AN EYE, HAN DRAWS HIS BLASTER AND POPS OFF A
COUPLE OF SHOTS DIRECTLY AT VADER.  THE DARK LORD QUICKLY RAISES HIS
HAND, DEFLECTING THE BOLTS INTO ONE OF THE SIDE WALLS, WHERE THEY
EXPLODE HARMLESSLY.  JUST AS QUICKLY, HAN'S WEAPON ZIPS INTO VADER'S
HAND.  THE EVIL PRESENCE CALMLY PLACES THE GUN ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF
HIM.

				VADER
		WE WOULD BE HONORED IF YOU WOULD
		JOIN US.

HAN GIVES LANDO A MEAN LOOK.

				LANDO
		I HAD NO CHOICE.  THEY ARRIVED
RIGHT BEFORE YOU DID.  I'M SORRY.

				HAN
		I'M SORRY, TOO.

EXT.  LUKE'S X-WING - BESPIN SYSTEM

LUKE'S X-WING RACES THROUGH THICK CLOUDS TOWARD CLOUD CITY.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

LUKE IS GRIM-FACED AS HE PILOTS HIS COURSE TOWARD BESPIN'S SHINING
CITY.  ARTOO'S BEEPS AND WHISTLES ARE TRANSMITTED ONTO THE SCOPE.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		NO, THREEPIO'S WITH THEM.

ARTOO WHISTLES ANOTHER WORRIED INQUIRY.

				LUKE
			(INTO COMLINK)
		JUST HANG ON.  WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

CHEWBACCA IS IN A CLOUD CITY PRISON CELL.  THE STARK ROOM IS FLOODED
WITH HOT LIGHT.  TO ADD TO CHEWIE'S MISERY, A HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLE
SCREECHES LOUDLY.  CHEWIE IS GOING MAD.  HE HITS THE WALL WITH GIANT
FISTS AS HE PACES BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE CELL FLOOR.  THE UPPER
LIGHTS GO OFF ABRUPTLY.  THE PRISONER RUBS HIS EYES AND MOVES TO A
WALL, WHERE HE LISTENS FOR A MOMENT.  THEN, MOANING TO HIMSELF, HE
MOVES TO A PLATFORM WHERE THE DISASSEMBLED PIECES OF THREEPIO LIE.  HE
PICKS UP THE GOLDEN DROID'S HEAD AND MEDITATES ON IT FOR A MOMENT,
BARKING A FEW PHILOSOPHICAL REMARKS.  CHEWIE STICKS THE ROBOT'S HEAD ON
ITS TORSO AND STARTS ADJUSTING WIRES AND CIRCUITS.

SUDDENLY, THE LIGHTS IN THREEPIO'S EYES SPARK TO LIFE AS CHEWIE TOUCHES
TWO CONNECTORS TOGETHER.  THREEPIO IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TO SPEAK, BUT HIS
VOICE IS SO SLOW AND SO LOW AS TO BE NEARLY UNINTELLIGIBLE.

				THREEPIO
		MMMM.  OH, MY.  UH, I, UH - TAKE
		THIS OFF!  I, UH, DON'T MEAN TO
		INTRUDE HERE.  I, DON'T, NO, NO,
		NO... PLEASE DON'T GET UP.  NO!

CHEWIE LOOKS AT THREEPIO IN BEWILDERMENT, THEN SCRATCHES HIS FURRY
HEAD.  HE GETS AN IDEA AND ADJUSTS SOME CONNECTIONS, WHEREUPON THREEPIO
IMMEDIATELY BEGINS SPEAKING NORMALLY.

				THREEPIO
		STORMTROOPERS?  HERE?  WE'RE IN
		DANGER.  I MUST TELL THE OTHERS.
		OH, NO!  I'VE BEEN SHOT!

INT. CLOUD CITY - PRISON ENTRY AREA

DARTH VADER STRIDES THROUGH THE ROOM AS TWO STORMTROOPERS PREPARE AN
ELABORATE TORTURE MECHANISM.  HAN IS STRAPPED TO A RACK WHICH TILTS
FORWARD ONTO THE TORTURE DEVICE.  VADER ACTIVATES THE MECHANISM,
CREATING TWO BURSTS OF SPARKS, ONE OF WHICH STRIKES HAN'S FACE.

THE DOOR OPENS, AND VADER LEAVES THE TORTURE ROOM JUST AS HAN SCREAMS A
SHARP, PIERCING CRY OF AGONY.  DARTH VADER MOVES TO THE HOLDING
CHAMBER, WHERE LANDO AND BOBA FETT AWAIT HIM.

INT. CLOUD CITY - HOLDING CHAMBER

				LANDO
		LORD VADER.

				VADER
			(TO FETT)
		YOU MAY TAKE CAPTAIN SOLO TO
		JABBA THE HUT AFTER I HAVE
		SKYWALKER.

HAN'S SCREAMS FILTER THROUGH THE TORTURE ROOM DOOR.

				BOBA FETT
		HE'S NO GOOD TO ME DEAD.

				VADER
		HE WILL NOT BE PERMANENTLY DAMAGED.

				LANDO
		LORD VADER, WHAT ABOUT LEIA AND
		THE WOOKIEE?

				VADER
		THEY MUST NEVER AGAIN LEAVE THIS
		CITY.

				LANDO
		THAT WAS NEVER A CONDITION OF OUR
		AGREEMENT, NOR WAS GIVING HAN TO
		THIS BOUNTY HUNTER!

				VADER
		PERHAPS YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING
		TREATED UNFAIRLY.

				LANDO
		NO.

				VADER
		GOOD.  IT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE IF
		I HAD TO LEAVE A GARRISON HERE.

VADER TURNS AND SWEEPS INTO THE ELEVATOR WITH BOBA FETT.  LANDO WALKS
SWIFTLY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, MUTTERING TO HIMSELF.

				LANDO
		THIS DEAL'S GETTING WORSE ALL
		THE TIME.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

CHEWIE NOW HAS A LITTLE MORE OF THREEPIO BACK TOGETHER.  ONE ARM IS
CONNECTED, BUT THE LEGS ARE YET TO BE ATTACHED.  THERE IS ONE SMALL
PROBLEM, HOWEVER.  IT SEEMS THE WOOKIEE HAS MANAGED TO PUT THE DROID'S
HEAD ON BACKWARDS.

				THREEPIO
		OH, YES, THAT'S VERY GOOD.  I LIKE
		THAT.  OH!  SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT
		BECAUSE NOW I CAN'T SEE.  WAIT.
		WAIT!  OH, MY!  WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
		I'M BACKWARDS, YOU STUPID FURBALL.
		ONLY AN OVERGROWN MOPHEAD LIKE YOU
		WOULD BE STUPID ENOUGH...

THREEPIO IS CUT OFF IN MID-SENTENCE AS CHEWIE ANGRILY DEACTIVATES A
CIRCUIT AND THE DROID SHUTS DOWN.  THE WOOKIEE SMELLS SOMETHING AND
SITS UP.  THE DOOR TO THE CHAMBER SLIDES OPEN AND A RAGGED HAN SOLO IS
SHOVED INTO THE ROOM BY TWO STORMTROOPERS.  BARKING HIS CONCERN, THE
HUGE WOOKIEE GIVES HAN A BIG HUG.  HAN IS VERY PALE, WITH DARK CIRCLES
UNDER HIS EYES.

				HAN
		I FEEL TERRIBLE.

CHEWIE HELPS HAN TO A PLATFORM AND THEN TURNS AS THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN
REVEALING LEIA.  SHE, TOO, LOOKS A LITTLE WORSE FOR WEAR.  THE TROOPERS
PUSH HER INTO THE CELL, AND THE DOOR SLIDES CLOSED.  SHE MOVES TO HAN,
WHO IS LYING ON THE PLATFORM, AND KNEELS NEXT TO HIM, GENTLY STROKING
HIS HEAD.

				LEIA
		WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?

				HAN
		THEY NEVER EVEN ASKED ME ANY
		QUESTIONS.

THE CELL DOOR SLIDES OPEN.  LANDO AND TWO OF HIS GUARDS ENTER.

				LEIA
		LANDO.

				HAN
		GET OUT OF HERE, LANDO!

				LANDO
		SHUT UP AND LISTEN!  VADER HAS
		AGREED TO TURN LEIA AND CHEWIE
		OVER TO ME.

				HAN
		OVER TO YOU?

				LANDO
		THEY'LL HAVE TO STAY HERE, BUT AT
		LEAST THEY'LL BE SAFE.

				LEIA
		WHAT ABOUT HAN?

				LANDO
		VADER'S GIVING HIM TO THE BOUNTY
		HUNTER.

				LEIA
		VADER WANTS US ALL DEAD.

				LANDO
		HE DOESN'T WANT YOU AT ALL.  HE'S
		AFTER SOMEBODY CALLED SKYWALKER.

				HAN
		LUKE?

				LANDO
		LORD VADER HAS SET A TRAP FOR HIM.

LEIA'S MIND IS RACING.

				LEIA
		AND WE'RE THE BAIT.

				LANDO
		WELL, HE'S ON HIS WAY.

HAN'S RAGE PEAKS.

				HAN
		PERFECT.  YOU FIXED US ALL PRETTY
		GOOD, DIDN'T YOU?
			(SPITS IT OUT)
		MY FRIEND!

HAN HAULS OFF AND PUNCHES LANDO.  THE TWO FRIENDS ARE INSTANTLY ENGAGED
IN A FRANTIC CLOSE-QUARTERS FIGHT.  THE GUARDS HIT HAN WITH THEIR RIFLE
BUTTS AND HE FLIES ACROSS THE ROOM.  CHEWIE GROWLS AND STARTS FOR THE
GUARDS.  THEY POINT THEIR LASER WEAPONS AT THE GIANT WOOKIEE, BUT LANDO
STOPS THEM.

				LANDO
		STOP!  I'VE DONE ALL I CAN.  I'M
		SORRY I COULDN'T DO BETTER, BUT
		I HAVE MY OWN PROBLEMS.

				HAN
		YEAH, YOU'RE A REAL HERO.

LANDO AND THE GUARDS LEAVE.  HAN WIPES THE BLOOD FROM HIS CHIN AS LEIA
AND CHEWIE HELP HIM UP.

				LEIA
			(DABS AT HIS WOUND)
		YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A WAY WITH
		PEOPLE.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

FOUR ARMOR-SUITED STORMTROOPERS STAND AT THE READY IN THE LARGE
CHAMBER, WHICH IS FILLED WITH PIPES AND CHEMICAL TANKS.  IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE ROOM IS A ROUND PIT HOUSING A HYDRAULIC PLATFORM.  DARTH VADER
AND LANDO STAND NEAR THE PLATFORM.

				VADER
		THIS FACILITY IS CRUDE, BUT IT
		SHOULD BE ADEQUATE TO FREEZE
		SKYWALKER FOR HIS JOURNEY TO THE
		EMPEROR.

AN IMPERIAL SOLDIER APPEARS.

				IMPERIAL SOLDIER
		LORD VADER, SHIP APPROACHING.
		X-WING CLASS.

				VADER
		GOOD.  MONITOR SKYWALKER AND ALLOW
		HIM TO LAND.

THE SOLDIER BOWS AND LEAVES THE CHAMBER.

				LANDO
		LORD VADER, WE ONLY USE THIS
		FACILITY FOR CARBON FREEZING.  IF
		YOU PUT HIM IN THERE, IT MIGHT
		KILL HIM.

				VADER
		I DO NOT WANT THE EMPEROR'S PRIZE
		DAMAGED.  WE WILL TEST IT... ON
		CAPTAIN SOLO.

LANDO'S FACE REGISTERS DISMAY.

EXT. SPACE - BESPIN SYSTEM -  LUKE'S X-WING

LUKE'S X-WING MOVES THROUGH THE CLOUDS AS IT NEARS THE CITY.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

ENCOUNTERING NO CITY GUARDS, LUKE SCANS THE DISPLAY PANEL WITH CONCERN.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

THERE IS A GREAT ACTIVITY ON THE CARBON-FREEZING PLATFORM.  SIX
UGNAUGHTS FRANTICALLY PREPARE THE CHAMBER FOR USE.  A SPECIAL
COFFINLIKE CONTAINER IS PUT IN PLACE.  WITH BOBA FETT IN THE LEAD, A
SQUAD OF SIX STORMTROOPERS BRINGS IN HAN, LEIA AND CHEWIE.  STRAPPED TO
CHEWIE'S BACK, WITH ONLY HIS HEAD, TORSO, AND ONE ARM ASSEMBLED, IS
THREEPIO.  THREEPIO'S HEAD FACES THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM CHEWIE'S
AND THE DROID IS CONSTANTLY TWISTING AROUND IN A VAIN EFFORT TO SEE
WHAT IS HAPPENING.  HIS ONE ATTACHED ARM IS ANIMATE AND EXPRESSIVE,
INTERMITTENTLY POINTING, GESTURING, AND COVERING HIS EYES.  THE
REMAINING PIECES OF HIS BODY ARE RANDOMLY BUNDLED TO THE WOOKIEE'S BACK
SO THAT HIS LEGS AND OTHER ARM STICK OUT AT ODD ANGLES FROM THE PACK.

				THREEPIO
		IF ONLY YOU HAD ATTACHED MY LEGS,
		I WOULDN'T BE IN THIS RIDICULOUS
		POSITION.  NOW, REMEMBER, CHEWBACCA,
		YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ME,
		SO DON'T DO ANYTHING FOOLISH.

				HAN
			(TO LANDO)
		WHAT'S GOING ON... BUDDY?

				LANDO
		YOU'RE BEING PUT INTO CARBON FREEZE.

BOBA FETT MOVES AWAY FROM THE GROUP TO DARTH VADER.

				BOBA FETT
		WHAT IF HE DOESN'T SURVIVE?  HE'S
		WORTH A LOT TO ME.

				VADER
		THE EMPIRE WILL COMPENSATE YOU
		IF HE DIES.  PUT HIM IN!

REALIZING WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN, CHEWIE LETS OUT A WILD HOWL AND
ATTACKS THE STORMTROOPERS SURROUNDING HAN.  WITHIN SECONDS, OTHER
IMPERIAL REINFORCEMENTS JOIN THE SCUFFLE, CLUBBING THE GIANT WOOKIEE
WITH THEIR LASER WEAPONS.

FROM THE INSTANT OF CHEWIE'S FIRST MOVE, THREEPIO BEGINS TO SCREAM IN
PANIC WHILE HE TRIES TO PROTECT HIMSELF WITH HIS ONE ARM.

				THREEPIO
		OH, NO!  NO, NO, NO!  STOP,
		CHEWBACCA, STOP...!

THE STORMTROOPERS ARE ABOUT TO BASH CHEWIE IN THE FACE.

				HAN
		STOP, CHEWIE, STOP!  DO YOU HEAR
		ME?  STOP!

				THREEPIO
		YES, STOP, PLEASE!  I'M NOT READY
		TO DIE.

HAN BREAKS AWAY FROM HIS CAPTORS.  VADER NODS TO THE GUARDS TO LET HIM
GO AND THE PIRATE BREAKS UP THE FIGHT.

				HAN
		CHEWIE!  CHEWIE, THIS WON'T HELP
		ME.  HEY!

HAN GIVES THE WOOKIEE A STERN LOOK.

				HAN
		SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.  THERE'LL BE
		ANOTHER TIME.  THE PRINCESS - YOU
		HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF HER.  YOU
		HEAR ME?

HAN WINKS AT THE WOOKIEE, WHO WAILS A DOLEFUL FAREWELL.

IN A FLASH THE GUARDS HAVE SLIPPED BINDERS ON CHEWBACCA, WHO IS TOO
DISTRAUGHT TO PROTEST.  HAN TURNS TO PRINCESS LEIA.  THEY LOOK
SORROWFULLY AT ONE ANOTHER, THEN HAN MOVES TOWARD HER AND GIVES HER A
FINAL, PASSIONATE KISS.

				LEIA
		I LOVE YOU!

				HAN
		I KNOW.

TEARS ROLL DOWN LEIA'S FACE AS SHE WATCHES THE DASHING PIRATE WALK TO
THE HYDRAULIC PLATFORM.  HAN LOOKS ONE FINAL TIME AT HIS FRIENDS - AND
THEN, SUDDENLY, THE PLATFORM DROPS.  CHEWIE HOWLS.  LEIA TURNS AWAY IN
AGONY.

LANDO WINCES IN SORROW; IT MAKES A LIFE-CHANGING IMPRESSION ON HIM.

INSTANTLY, FIERY LIQUID BEGINS TO POUR DOWN IN A SHOWER OF SPARKS AND
FLUID AS GREAT AS ANY STEEL FURNACE.  HOLDING LEIA, CHEWIE HALF-TURNS
AWAY FROM THE SIGHT, GIVING THREEPIO A VIEW OF THE PROCEDURE.

				THREEPIO
		WHAT... WHAT'S GOING ON?  TURN
		ROUND, CHEWBACCA, I CAN'T SEE.
		OH... THEY'VE ENCASED HIM IN
		CARBONITE.  HE SHOULD BE QUITE
		WELL-PROTECTED - IF HE SURVIVES
		THE FREEZING PROCESS, THAT IS.

CHEWIE IS IN NO MOOD FOR TECHNICAL DISCUSSION; HE GIVES THE DROID AN
ANGRY GLANCE AND BARK.

A HUGE MECHANICAL TONG LIFTS THE STEAMING METAL-ENCASED SPACE PIRATE
OUT OF THE VAT AND STANDS HIM ON THE PLATFORM.  SOME UGNAUGHTS RUSH
OVER AND PUSH THE BLOCK OVER ONTO THE PLATFORM.  THEY SLIDE THE
COFFINLIKE STRUCTURE TO THE BLOCK AND LIFT THE METAL BLOCK, PLACING IT
INSIDE.  THEY THEN ATTACH AN ELECTRONIC BOX ONTO THE STRUCTURE AND STEP
AWAY.  LANDO KNEELS AND ADJUSTS SOME KNOBS, MEASURING THE HEAT.  HE
SHAKES HIS HEAD IN RELIEF.

				VADER
		WELL, CALRISSIAN, DID HE SURVIVE?

				LANDO
		YES, HE'S ALIVE.  AND IN PERFECT
		HIBERNATION.

VADER TURNS TO BOBA FETT.

				VADER
		HE'S ALL YOURS BOUNTY HUNTER.
		RESET THE CHAMBER FOR SKYWALKER.

				IMPERIAL OFFICER
		SKYWALKER HAS JUST LANDED, MY
		LORD.

				VADER
		GOOD.  SEE TO IT THAT HE FINDS
		HIS WAY HERE.  CALRISSIAN, TAKE
		THE PRINCESS AND THE WOOKIEE TO
		MY SHIP.

				LANDO
		YOU SAID THEY'D BE LEFT IN THE
		CITY UNDER MY SUPERVISION.

				VADER
		I AM ALTERING THE DEAL.  PRAY I
		DON'T ALTER IT ANY FURTHER.

LANDO'S HAND INSTINCTIVELY GOES TO HIS THROAT AS HE TURNS TO LEIA,
CHEWIE, AND THREEPIO.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

AS LUKE AND ARTOO MOVE CAREFULLY DOWN A DESERTED CORRIDOR, THEY HEAR A
GROUP OF PEOPLE COMING DOWN A SIDE HALLWAY.  ARTOO LETS OUT AN EXCITED
SERIES OF BEEPS AND WHISTLES.  LUKE GLARES AT THE TINY DROID, WHO STOPS
IN HIS TRACKS WITH A FEEBLE SQUEAK.

BOBA FETT ENTERS FROM A SIDE HALLWAY FOLLOWED BY TWO GUARDS PUSHING THE
FLOATING, ENCASED BODY OF HAN SOLO.  TWO STORMTROOPERS, WHO FOLLOW,
IMMEDIATELY SPOT LUKE AND OPEN FIRE ON HIM.  THE YOUTH DRAWS HIS WEAPON
AND BLASTS THE TWO TROOPERS BEFORE THEY CAN GET OFF A SECOND SHOT.  THE
TWO GUARDS WHISK HAN INTO ANOTHER HALLWAY AS FETT LOWERS HIS ARM AND
FIRES A DEADLY LASER AT LUKE, WHICH EXPLODES TO ONE SIDE AND TEARS UP A
HUGE CHUNK OF WALL.

LUKE RUSHES TO A SIDE HALLWAY, BUT BY THE TIME HE REACHES IT, FETT,
HAN, AND THE GUARDS ARE GONE.  A THINK METAL DOOR BLOCKS THE PASSAGE.
LUKE TURNS TO SEE LEIA, CHEWIE, THREEPIO, AND LANDO BEING HERDED DOWN A
SECOND HALLWAY BY SEVERAL OTHER STORMTROOPERS.  LEIA TURNS JUST IN TIME
TO SEE LUKE.

				LEIA
		LUKE!  LUKE, DON'T - IT'S A
		TRAP!  IT'S A TRAP!

BEFORE SHE CAN FINISH, SHE IS PULLED THROUGH A DOORWAY AND DISAPPEARS
FROM SIGHT.  LUKE RACES AFTER THE GROUP, LEAVING LITTLE ARTOO TRAILING
BEHIND.

INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM

LUKE RUNS INTO AN ANTEROOM AND STOPS TO GET HIS BEARINGS.  LEIA AND THE
OTHERS ARE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.  BEHIND LUKE, ARTOO SCOOTS DOWN THE
CORRIDOR TOWARD THE ANTEROOM WHEN SUDDENLY A GIANT METAL DOOR COMES
SLAMMING DOWN, CUTTING OFF LUKE'S EXIT.  SEVERAL MORE DOORS CLANG SHUT,
ECHOING THROUGH THE CHAMBER.

INT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM

ARTOO STANDS WITH HIS NOSE PRESSED AGAINST THE GIANT METAL DOOR.  HE
WHISTLES A LONG SIGH OF RELIEF AND, A LITTLE DAZED, WANDERS OFF IN THE
OTHER DIRECTION.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOM

LUKE CAUTIOUSLY WALKS FORWARD AMONG HISSING PIPES AND STEAM.  SEEING AN
OPENING ABOVE HIM, HE STOPS TO LOOK UP.  AS HE DOES, THE PLATFORM HE
STANDS ON BEGINS TO MOVE.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

LUKE RISES INTO THE CHAMBER, BORNE BY THE PLATFORM.  THE ROOM IS
DEATHLY QUIET.  VERY LITTLE STEAM ESCAPES THE PIPES AND NO ONE ELSE
SEEMS TO BE IN THE LARGE ROOM.  WARILY, LUKE WALKS TOWARD THE STAIRWAY.

STEAM BEGINS TO BUILD UP IN THE CHAMBER.  LOOKING UP THROUGH THE STEAM,
LUKE SEES A DARK FIGURE STANDING ON A WALKWAY ABOVE HIM.  LUKE HOLSTERS
HIS GUN AND MOVES UP THE STAIRS TO FACE VADER.  HE FEELS CONFIDENT,
EAGER TO ENGAGE HIS ENEMY.

				VADER
		THE FORCE IS WITH YOU, YOUNG
		SKYWALKER.  BUT YOU ARE NOT A
		JEDI YET.

LUKE IGNITES HIS SWORD IN ANSWER.  IN AN INSTANT, VADER'S OWN SWORD IS
LIT.  LUKE LUNGES, BUT VADER REPELS THE BLOW.  AGAIN LUKE ATTACKS, AND
THE SWORDS OF THE TWO COMBATANTS CLASH IN BATTLE.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

LEIA, LANDO, AND CHEWIE, WITH THREEPIO ON HIS BACK, MARCH ALONG,
GUARDED BY SIX STORMTROOPERS.  THE GROUP REACHES AN INTERSECTION WHERE
LOBOT AND A DOZEN OF LANDO'S GUARDS STAND AT ATTENTION.

THE GUARDS IMMEDIATELY AIM THEIR WEAPONS AT THE STARTLED STORMTROOPERS.
TAKING THE STORMTROOPERS' WEAPONS FROM THEM, LOBOT HANDS ONE TO LEIA
AND ONE TO LANDO.

				LANDO
		WELL DONE.  HOLD THEM IN THE
		SECURITY TOWER - AND KEEP IT
		QUIET.  MOVE.

AS LANDO'S GUARDS QUICKLY MARCH THE STORMTROOPERS AWAY, LANDO BEGINS TO
UNDO CHEWIE'S BINDING.

				LEIA
		WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

				LANDO
		WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.

				THREEPIO
		I KNEW ALL ALONG IT HAD TO BE A
		MISTAKE.

CHEWIE TURNS ON LANDO AND STARTS TO CHOKE HIM.

				LEIA
		DO YOU THINK THAT AFTER WHAT YOU
		DID TO HAN WE'RE GOING TO TRUST
		YOU?

LANDO TRIES TO FREE HIMSELF FROM CHEWIE.

				LANDO
			(CHOKING)
		I HAD NO CHOICE...

CHEWIE BARKS FEROCIOUSLY.

				THREEPIO
			(TO CHEWIE)
		WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  TRUST HIM,
		TRUST HIM!

				LEIA
		OH, SO WE UNDERSTAND, DON'T WE,
		CHEWIE?  HE HAD NO CHOICE.

				LANDO
		I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP...

				LEIA
		WE DON'T NEED ANY OF YOUR HELP.

				LANDO
			(CHOKING)
		H-A-A-A...

				LEIA
		WHAT?

				THREEPIO
		IT SOUNDS LIKE HAN.

				LANDO
		THERE'S STILL A CHANCE TO SAVE
		HAN... I MEAN, AT THE EAST
		PLATFORM...

				LEIA
		CHEWIE.

CHEWIE FINALLY RELEASES LANDO, WHO FIGHTS TO GET HIS BREATH BACK.

				THREEPIO
			(TO LANDO)
		I'M TERRIBLY SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.
		AFTER ALL, HE'S ONLY A WOOKIEE.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT'S SHIP

THE TWO GUARDS SLIDE HAN'S ENCASED BODY INTO AN OPENING IN THE SIDE OF
THE BOUNTY HUNTER'S SHIP.  BOBA FETT CLIMB ABOARD ON A LADDER NEXT TO
THE CARGO HOLD.

				BOBA FETT
		PUT CAPTAIN SOLO IN THE CARGO
		HOLD.

AND WITH THAT, THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

LANDO, LEIA, AND CHEWIE RUN DOWN A CLOUD CITY CORRIDOR WHEN SUDDENLY
THEY SPOT ARTOO WHO RUSHES TOWARD THEM, BEEPING WILDLY.

				THREEPIO
		ARTOO!  ARTOO!  WHERE HAVE YOU
		BEEN?

CHEWIE TURNS AROUND TO SEE THE STUBBY DROID, CAUSING THREEPIO TO BE
SPUN OUT OF SIGHT OF HIS FRIEND.

				THREEPIO
		TURN AROUND, YOU WOOLY...!
			(TO ARTOO)
		HURRY, HURRY!  WE'RE TRYING TO
		SAVE HAN FROM THE BOUNTY HUNTER!

WHISTLING FRANTICALLY TO THREEPIO, ARTOO SCOOTS ALONG WITH THE RACING
GROUP.

				THREEPIO
		WELL, AT LEAST YOUR STILL IN
		ONE PIECE!  LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO
		ME!

EXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY

AN ELEVATOR DOOR SLIDES OPEN AND LANDO, LEIA, AND CHEWBACCA RACE FOR A
LARGE BAY OVERLOOKING THE EAST LANDING PLATFORM.

JUST AS THEY ARRIVE, BOBA FETT'S SHIP TAKES OFF AGAINST A CLOUDY SUNSET
SKY.

IN WILD ANGUISH, CHEWIE HOWLS AND STARTS FIRING AT THE SHIP.

				THREEPIO
		OH, NO!  CHEWIE, THEY'RE BEHIND
		YOU!

A LASER BOLT EXPLODES NEAR THE PRINCESS.  EVERYONE TURNS TO SEE WHAT
THREEPIO HAS ALREADY SPOTTED COMING FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION; A SQUAD
OF STORMTROOPERS RUNNING TOWARD THEM.  ARTOO PEEKS OUT FROM THE
ELEVATOR.

LEIA AND CHEWBACCA START FIRING AT THE TROOPERS AS LANDO MAKES A BREAK
FOR THE ELEVATOR.  LASER BOLTS CONTINUE TO EXPLODE AROUND THE PRINCESS
AND THE WOOKIEE, BUT THEY REFUSE TO BUDGE.  LANDO STICKS HIS HEAD OUT
OF THE ELEVATOR AND MOTIONS FOR THE PAIR TO RUN, BUT THEY BARELY
NOTICE.  THEY SEEM POSSESSED, TRANSPORTED, AS ALL THE FRUSTRATION OF
CAPTIVITY AND ANGER OF LOSS POUR THROUGH THEIR DEATH-DEALING WEAPONS.

BUT AFTER A FEW MOMENTS, THEY BEGIN TO MOVE THROUGH THE RAIN OF LASER
FIRE TOWARD THE ELEVATOR.  ONCE THEY ARE INSIDE, THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT
AND THE STORMTROOPERS RACE FORWARD.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

LUKE AND VADER ARE LOCKED IN COMBAT ON THE PLATFORM OVERLOOKING THE
CHAMBER.  THEIR SWORDS CLASH, THE PLATFORM SWAYS.  LUKE AGGRESSIVELY
DRIVES VADER BACK, FORCING VADER TO USE DEFENSIVE TACTICS.

				VADER
		YOU HAVE LEARNED MUCH, YOUNG ONE.

				LUKE
		YOU'LL FIND I'M FULL OF SURPRISES.

VADER MAKES TWO QUICK MOVES, HOOKING LUKE'S SWORD OUT OF HIS HAND AND
SENDING IT FLYING.  ANOTHER LIGHTNING MOVE AT LUKE'S FEET FORCES THE
YOUTH TO JUMP BACK TO PROTECT HIMSELF.  LOSING HIS BALANCE, LUKE ROLLS
DOWN THE STAIRS TO THE CIRCULAR CARBON-FREEZING PLATFORM.  THERE HE
SPRAWLS ON THE FLOOR, SURPRISED AND SHAKEN.  JUST IN TIME HE LOOKS UP
TO SEE VADER, LIKE A GIANT BLACK BIRD, FLYING RIGHT AT HIM.  LUKE ROLLS
AWAY AS VADER LANDS.  CROUCHING, LUKE KEEPS HIS GAZE STEADILY ON HIS
ENEMY.

				VADER
		YOUR DESTINY LIES WITH ME,
		SKYWALKER.  OBI-WAN KNEW THIS TO
		BE TRUE.

				LUKE
		NO!

BEHIND LUKE THE HYDRAULIC ELEVATOR COVER HAS OPENED NOISELESSLY.  ALL
THE WHILE, LUKE SLOWLY, CAUTIOUSLY MOVES BACK, AWAY FROM THE DARK LORD.

SUDDENLY, VADER ATTACKS SO FORCEFULLY THAT LUKE LOSES HIS BALANCE AND
FALLS BACK INTO THE OPENING.  THERE IS A RUMBLE, AND IN AN INSTANT
FREEZING STEAM RISES TO OBSCURE VADER'S VISION.   VADER TURNS ASIDE AND
DEACTIVATES HIS SWORD.

				VADER
		ALL TO EASY.  PERHAPS YOU ARE NOT
		AS STRONG AS THE EMPEROR THOUGHT.

THROUGH THE STEAM BEHIND VADER SOMETHING BLURS UPWARD.  LIQUID METAL
BEGINS TO POUR INTO THE PIT.

VADER TURNS AROUND - AND THEN LOOKS UP.  HE SEES LUKE, WHO HAS LEAPED
FIFTEEN FEET STRAIGHT UP AND WHO NOW HANGS FROM SOME HOSES ON THE
CARBONITE OUTLET.

				VADER
		IMPRESSIVE... MOST IMPRESSIVE.

LUKE JUMPS DOWN TO THE PLATFORM WHERE HE IS SEPARATED FROM VADER BY THE
STEAMING CARBONITE PIT.  HE RAISES HIS HAND.  HIS SWORD, WHICH HAD
FALLEN ON ANOTHER PART OF THE PLATFORM, SWIFTLY JUMPS INTO HIS
OUTSTRETCHED HAND AND IS INSTANTLY IGNITED.  VADER IMMEDIATELY LIGHTS
HIS SWORD AS WELL.

				VADER
		OBI-WAN HAS TAUGHT YOU WELL.  YOU
		HAVE CONTROLLED YOUR FEAR... NOW
		RELEASE YOUR ANGER.

LUKE IS MORE CAUTIOUS, CONTROLLING HIS ANGER.  HE BEGINS TO RETREAT AS
VADER GOADS HIM ON.  AS LUKE TAKES A DEFENSIVE POSITION, HE REALIZES HE
HAS BEEN FOOLHARDY.  A QUICK SWORD EXCHANGE AND LUKE FORCES VADER BACK.
ANOTHER EXCHANGE AND VADER RETREATS.  LUKE PRESSES FORWARD.

				VADER
		ONLY YOUR HATRED CAN DESTROY ME.

BREATHING HARD, LUKE JUMPS IN THE AIR, TURNING A SOMERSAULT OVER VADER.
HE LANDS ON THE FLOOR AND SLASHES AT VADER AS THE ROOM CONTINUES TO
FILL UP WITH STEAM.

VADER RETREATS BEFORE LUKE'S SKILLFUL SWORD.  VADER BLOCKS THE SWORD,
BUT LOOSES HIS BALANCE AND FALLS INTO THE OUTER RIM OF PIPES.  THE
ENERGY LUKE HAS USED TO STOP VADER HAS BROUGHT HIM TO THE POINT OF
COLLAPSE.  LUKE MOVES TO THE EDGE AND LOOKS DOWN, BUT SEES NO SIGN OF
VADER.  HE THEN DEACTIVATES HIS SWORD, HOOKS IT ON HIS BELT, AND LOWERS
HIMSELF INTO THE PIT.

INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM

MOVING THROUGH A TUNNELLIKE ENTRANCE, LUKE CAUTIOUSLY APPROACHES THE
REACTOR ROOM.  HE IGNITES HIS SWORD AND MOVES INTO THE ROOM AND TOWARD
A LARGE WINDOW AS VADER ENTERS.

LUKE RAISES HIS SWORD AND MOVES FORWARD TO ATTACK.

BEHIND LUKE A LARGE PIECE OF MACHINERY DETACHES ITSELF FROM THE WALL
AND COMES SMASHING FORWARD TOWARD HIS BACK.  LUKE TURNS AND CUTS IT IN
HALF JUST AS ANOTHER MACHINE COMES HURTLING AT HIM.  USING THE FORCE,
LUKE MANAGES TO DEFLECT IT AND SEND IT FLYING AS IF IT HAD HIT AN
INVISIBLE SHIELD.

A LARGE PIPE DETACHES AND COMES FLYING AT LUKE.  HE DEFLECTS IT.
SPARKING WIRES PULL OUT OF THE WALL AND BEGIN TO WHIP AT THE YOUTH.
SMALL TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT COME FLYING AT HIM.  BOMBARDMENT FROM ALL
SIDES, LUKE DOES HIS BEST TO DEFLECT EVERYTHING, BUT SOON HE IS
BLOODIED AND BRUISED.  FINALLY, ONE MACHINE GLANCES OFF HIS AND GOES
FLYING OUT THE LARGE WINDOW.  A FIERCE WIND BLOWS INTO THE ROOM,
UNMOVING, STANDS THE DARK, ROCKLIKE FIGURE OF VADER.

A PIECE OF MACHINERY HITS LUKE AND HE IS KNOCKED OUT OF THE WINDOW.

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

LUKE FALLS ONTO THE GANTRY, ROLLS, AND HANGS OVER THE EDGE, HOLDING HIS
DEACTIVATED SWORD IN HAND.  HE PUTS THE SWORD ON HIS BELT AND BEGINS TO
SCRAMBLE UP.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM

LEIA, LANDO, CHEWIE AND THE DROIDS COME ROUND A CORNER AND HEAD FOR THE
DOOR TO THE LANDING PLATFORM.  THEY GLIMPSE THE MILLENNIUM FALCON FOR A
MOMENT BEFORE THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT.  THE GROUP DUCKS INTO AN ALCOVE AS
STORMTROOPERS ARRIVE AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR.  THE TROOPERS SEND A
RAIN OF LASER BOLTS AT THE GROUP.  CHEWIE RETURNS THEIR FIRE AS LANDO
PUNCHES DESPERATELY AT THE DOOR'S CONTROL PANEL.

				LANDO
		THE SECURITY CODES HAS BEEN CHANGED!

				THREEPIO
		ARTOO, YOU CAN TELL THE COMPUTER
		TO OVERRIDE THE SECURITY SYSTEM.

THREEPIO POINTS TO A COMPUTER SOCKET ON THE CONTROL PANEL.  ARTOO BEEPS
AND SCOOTS TOWARD IT.  LANDO MEANWHILE HAS CONNECTED UP TO THE PANEL'S
INTERCOM.

				LANDO
		ATTENTION!  THIS IS LANDO
		CALRISSIAN.  THE EMPIRE HAS TAKES
		CONTROL OF THE CITY.  I ADVISE
		EVERYONE TO LEAVE BEFORE MORE
		IMPERIAL TROOPS ARRIVE.

ARTOO TAKES OFF A COMPUTER COVER AND STICKS HIS COMPUTER ARM INTO THE
SOCKET.  SUDDENLY, A SHORT BEEP TURNS INTO A WILD SCREAM.  ARTOO'S
CIRCUITS LIGHT UP, HIS HEAD SPINS WILDLY, AND SMOKE BEGINS TO SEEP OUT
UNDERNEATH HIM.  QUICKLY, CHEWIE PULLS HIM AWAY.

				LANDO
		THIS WAY.

LANDO, LEIA, ARTOO, AND CHEWIE FLEE DOWN THE CORRIDOR.  AS HE SCOOTS
ALONG WITH THEM, ARTOO SENDS SOME ANGRY BEEPS THREEPIO'S WAY.

				THREEPIO
		DON'T BLAME ME.  I'M AN INTERPRETER.
		I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW A POWER
		SOCKET FROM A COMPUTER TERMINAL.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

IN A PANIC, CLOUD CITY RESIDENTS ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE CITY.
SOME CARRY BOXES, OTHERS PACKAGES.  THEY RUN, THEN CHANGE DIRECTION.
SOME ARE SHOOTING AT STORMTROOPERS, OTHERS SIMPLY TRY TO HIDE.

OTHER STORMTROOPERS PURSUE LANDO, LEIA, AND CHEWIE WHO ARE FIRING BACK
AT THEM.  ARTOO WORKS ON ANOTHER DOOR TO THE LANDING PLATFORM WHILE
THREEPIO BERATES HIM FOR HIS SEEMING INEPTITUDE.

				THREEPIO
		WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  WE'RE
		NOT INTERESTED IN THE HYPERDRIVE
		ON THE MILLENNIUM FALCON.  IT'S
		FIXED!  JUST OPEN THE DOOR, YOU
		STUPID LUMP.

CHEWIE, LEIA, AND LANDO RETREAT ALONG THE CORRIDOR.  A TRIUMPHANT BEEP
FROM ARTOO - AND THE DOOR SNAPS OPEN.

				THREEPIO
			(TO ARTOO)
		I NEVER DOUBTED YOU FOR A SECOND.
		WONDERFUL!

ARTOO LAYS A CLOUD FOG, OBSCURING EVERYTHING, AS THE GROUP DASHES
OUTSIDE.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK

THEY RACE FOR THE MILLENNIUM FALCON AS A BATTALION OF STORMTROOPERS
REACHES THE MAIN DOOR.  LANDO AND LEIA HOLD OFF THE TROOPS AS THE
DROIDS GET ON BOARD WITH CHEWIE.  AS CHEWIE BOUNDS TO THE SHIP THE
THREEPIO ON HIS BACK, THREEPIO HITS HIS HEAD ON THE TOP OF THE RAMP.

				THREEPIO
		OUCH!  OH!  AH!  THAT HURT.  BEND
		DOWN, YOU THOUGHTLESS... OW!

CHEWIE STARTS UP THE SHIP.  THE GIANT ENGINES BEGIN TO WHINE AS LANDO
AND LEIA RACE UP THE RAMP UNDER A HAIL OF LASER FIRE.

				LANDO
		LEIA!  GO!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR

ARTOO DRAGS THE PARTIALLY ASSEMBLED THREEPIO DOWN THE CORRIDOR OF THE
FALCON.

				THREEPIO
		I THOUGHT THAT HAIRY BEAST WOULD
		BE THE END OF ME.  OF COURSE, I'VE
		LOOKED BETTER.

ARTOO BEEPS UNDERSTANDINGLY.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

CHEWIE WORKS THE CONTROLS AS LEIA SITS IN HAN'S SEAT AND LANDO WATCHES
OVER THEIR SHOULDERS.  AS CHEWIE PULLS BACK ON THE THROTTLE, THE SHIP
BEGINS TO MOVE.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSK

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON LIFTS GRACEFULLY INTO THE TWILIGHT SKY AND ROARS
AWAY FROM THE CITY.  TROOPS FIRE AFTER IT AND TIE FIGHTERS TAKE OFF IN
PURSUIT.

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

LUKE MOVES ALONG THE RAILING AND UP TO THE CONTROL ROOM.

VADER LUNGES AT HIM AND LUKE IMMEDIATELY RAISES HIS LIT SWORD TO MEET
VADER'S.  SPARKS FLY AS THEY DUEL, VADER GRADUALLY FORCING LUKE
BACKWARD TOWARD THE GANTRY.

				VADER
		YOU ARE BEATEN.  IT IS USELESS
		TO RESIST.  DON'T LET YOURSELF
		BE DESTROYED AS OBI-WAN DID.

LUKE ANSWERS BY ROLLING SIDEWAYS AND THRUSTING HIS SWORD AT VADER SO
VICIOUSLY THAT HE NICKS VADER ON THE SHOULDER.  THE BLACK ARMOR SPARKS
AND SMOKES AND VADER SEEMS TO BE HURT, BUT IMMEDIATELY RECOVERS.

LUKE BACKS OFF ALONG THE NARROW END OF THE GANTRY AS VADER COMES AT
HIM, SLASHING AT THE YOUNG JEDI WITH HIS SWORD.  LUKE MAKES A QUICK
MOVE AROUND THE INSTRUMENT COMPLEX ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE GANTRY.
VADER'S SWORD COMES SLASHING DOWN, CUTTING THE COMPLEX LOOSE; IT BEGINS
TO FALL, THEN IS CAUGHT BY THE RISING WIND AND BLOWN UPWARD.

LUKE GLANCES AT THE INSTRUMENT COMPLEX FLOATING AWAY.  AT THAT INSTANT,
VADER'S SWORD COMES DOWN ACROSS LUKE'S RIGHT FOREARM, CUTTING OFF HIS
HAND AND SENDING HIS SWORD FLYING.  IN GREAT PAIN, LUKE SQUEEZES HIS
FOREARM UNDER HIS LEFT ARMPIT AND MOVES BACK ALONG THE GANTRY TO ITS
EXTREME END.  VADER
FOLLOWS.  THE WIND SUBSIDES.  LUKE HOLDS ON.  THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE TO
GO.

				VADER
		THERE IS NO ESCAPE.  DON'T MAKE
		ME DESTROY YOU.  YOU DO NOT YET
		REALIZE YOUR IMPORTANCE.  YOU
		HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO DISCOVER YOUR
		POWER.  JOIN ME AND I WILL COMPLETE
		YOUR TRAINING.  WITH OUR COMBINED
		STRENGTH, WE CAN END THIS DESTRUCTIVE
		CONFLICT AND BRING ORDER TO THE
		GALAXY.

				LUKE
		I'LL NEVER JOIN YOU!

				VADER
		IF YOU ONLY KNEW THE POWER OF THE
		DARK SIDE.  OBI-WAN NEVER TOLD
		YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FATHER.

				LUKE
		HE TOLD ME ENOUGH!  IT WAS YOU
		WHO KILLED HIM.

				VADER
		NO.  I AM YOUR FATHER.

SHOCKED, LUKE LOOKS AT VADER IN UTTER DISBELIEF.

				LUKE
		NO.  NO.  THAT'S NOT TRUE!
		THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

				VADER
		SEARCH YOUR FEELINGS.  YOU KNOW
		IT TO BE TRUE.

				LUKE
		NO!  NO!  NO!

				VADER
		LUKE.  YOU CAN DESTROY THE EMPEROR.
		HE HAS FORESEEN THIS.  IT IS YOUR
		DESTINY.  JOIN ME, AND TOGETHER
		WE CAN RULE THE GALAXY AS FATHER
		AND SON.  COME WITH ME.  IT IS THE
		ONLY WAY.

VADER PUTS AWAY HIS SWORD AND HOLDS HIS HAND OUT TO LUKE.

A CALM COMES OVER LUKE, AND HE MAKES A DECISION.  IN THE NEXT INSTANT
HE STEPS OFF THE GANTRY PLATFORM INTO SPACE.  THE DARK LORD LOOKS OVER
THE PLATFORM AND SEES LUKE FALLING FAR BELOW.  THE WIND BEGINS TO BLOW
AT VADER'S CAPE AND THE TORRENT FINALLY FORCES HIM BACK, AWAY FROM THE
EDGE.  THE WIND SOON FADES AND THE WOUNDED JEDI BEGINS TO DROP FAST,
UNABLE TO GRAB ONTO ANYTHING TO BREAK HIS FALL.

INT. REACTOR SHAFT

SUDDENLY LUKE IS SUCKED INTO AN EXHAUST PIPE IN THE SIDE OF THE SHAFT.
WHEN VADER SEES THIS, HE TURNS AND HURRIES OFF THE PLATFORM.

INT. EXHAUST PIPE

LUKE TUMBLES THROUGH THE EXHAUST PIPE.

HE SLIDES TO THE END OF THE SLICKLY POLISHED PIPE AND STOPS AS HIS FEET
HIT A CIRCULAR GRILL AND KNOCK IT OPEN.  LUKE CLAWS AT THE SURFACE OF
THE PIPE, TRYING TO KEEP FROM SLIDING OUT INTO SPACE.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK

UNABLE TO HANG ONTO THE PIPE, LUKE TUMBLES OUT, EMERGING AT THE
UNDERMOST PART OF CLOUD CITY.  REACHING OUT DESPERATELY, HE MANAGES TO
GRAB ONTO ON ELECTRONIC WEATHER VANE.

				LUKE
		BEN... BEN, PLEASE!

LUKE TRIES TO PULL HIMSELF UP ON THE WEATHER VANE BUT SLIPS BACK DOWN.
HE HOOKS ONE OF HIS LEGS AROUND THE FRAGILE INSTRUMENTS.  ALL THE
WHILE, A POWERFUL CURRENT OF AIR RUSHES OUT AT HIM FROM THE EXHAUST
PIPE.

				LUKE
		BEN.  LEIA!

THERE IS AN OMINOUS CRACKING SOUND FROM THE BASE OF THE
WEATHER VANE AND A PIECE BREAKS OFF, FALLING INTO THE CLOUDS FAR BELOW.

				LUKE
		HEAR ME!  LEIA!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

LEIA SEEMS TO BE LOST IN A FOG, HER EXPRESSION TROUBLED.  CHEWIE IS
BUSY OPERATING THE SHIP.  LANDO STANDS NEXT TO THE WOOKIEE, WATCHING A
READOUT ON THE CONTROL PANEL.

				LEIA
		LUKE... WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK.

CHEWIE GROWLS IN SURPRISE.

				LANDO
		WHAT?

				LEIA
		I KNOW WHERE LUKE IS.

				LANDO
		BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE FIGHTER?

CHEWIE BARKS IN AGREEMENT WITH LANDO.

				LEIA
		CHEWIE, JUST DO IT.

				LANDO
		BUT WHAT ABOUT VADER?

CHEWIE TURNS ON LANDO, THE NEWCOMER, WITH AN OMINOUS GROWL.

				LANDO
		ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK

THE FALCON MAKES A GRACEFUL BANKING TURN BACK TOWARD CLOUD CITY.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

VADER ENTERS THE LANDING PLATFORM AND WATCHES AS THE SPECK THAT IS THE
FALCON DISAPPEARS.  THE WIND BLOWS AT HIS CAPE.

HE TURNS TO TWO AIDES WHO ARE STANDING NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE LANDING
PLATFORM.

				VADER
		BRING MY SHUTTLE.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE

NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS, LUKE HANGS UPSIDE-DOWN ON THE WEATHER VANE AS HIS
BODY SHIFTS IN THE WIND.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

THE FALCON DIVES TO THE UNDERSIDE OF THE FLOATING CITY.  THREE TIE
FIGHTER CLOSE IN ON THE STARSHIP.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

LEIA TRIES TO REMAIN CALM.

				LANDO
			(POINTING OUT THE
			 COCKPIT WINDOW)
		LOOK, SOMEONE'S UP THERE.

				LEIA
		IT'S LUKE.  CHEWIE, SLOW DOWN.
		SLOW DOWN AND WE'LL GET UNDER HIM.
		LANDO, OPEN THE TOP HATCH.

LANDO RUSHES OUT OF THE COCKPIT.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE

LUKE HANGS BY ONE ARM FROM THE CROSSBAR OF THE WEATHER VANE.  HE SLIPS
FROM THE BAR AND GRABS ONTO THE POLE OF THE VANE AS THE FALCON BANKS
TOWARD HIM.  THE FALCON POSITIONS ITSELF UNDER LUKE AS LANDO MOVES UP
THROUGH THE OPENING OF THE HATCH.  LUKE BEGINS TO SLIDE AND FINALLY
FALLS FROM THE VANE INTO SPACE.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

OUT THE COCKPIT WINDOW, LEIA SEES LUKE FALLING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE
CITY.  THE SHIP GAINS ON HIM.

				LEIA
		OKAY.  EASY, CHEWIE.

THE FALCON CLOSES IN ON LUKE.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

THREE TIE FIGHTERS RACE TOWARD THE FALCON, FIRING AWAY.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HATCH

THE HATCH POPS OPEN WITH A HISS OF PRESSURE.  LANDO REACHES OUT TO HELP
THE BATTERED WARRIOR INSIDE THE SHIP.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

FLAK BURSTS ALL AROUND IT AS THE FALCON BANKS AWAY FROM THE CITY.  LEIA
AND CHEWIE STRUGGLE WITH THE CONTROLS.

				LEIA
			(INTO INTERCOM)
		LANDO?

				LANDO
			(OVER INTERCOM)
		OKAY, LET'S GO.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

THE FALCON RACES AWAY.  IT IS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THREE TIE FIGHTERS,
ALL OF WHICH KEEP UP A HEAVY LASER ASSAULT ON THE FLEEING STARSHIP.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

EXPLOSIONS ERUPT ALL AROUND THE COCKPIT, BUFFETING THE SHIP WILDLY.
CHEWIE HOWLS AS HE FRANTICALLY TRIES TO CONTROL THE SHIP.

LEIA AND CHEWIE TURNS TO SEE LUKE, BLOODY AND BATTERED, ENTER THE
COCKPIT SUPPORTED BY LANDO.  LEIA JUMPS UP AND HUGS HIM WHILE CHEWIE
BARKS IN JOYOUS RELIEF.

				LUKE
		OH, LEIA.

				LANDO
		ALL RIGHT, CHEWIE.  LET'S GO.

LEIA HELPS LUKE FROM THE COCKPIT AS ANOTHER HUGE BLAST ROCKS THE SHIP.

EXT. SPACE - CLOUD CITY - DAY

THE FALCON, STILL FOLLOWED BY THE THREE TIE FIGHTERS, RACES AWAY FROM
THE CLOUD-COVERED CITY.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

LUKE RESTS ON A COT, HIS INJURED ARM WRAPPED IN A PROTECTIVE CUFF.
LEIA GENTLY WIPES HIS FACE.  THE SHIP LURCHES AGAIN.

				LEIA
		I'LL BE BACK.

SHE KISSES HIM, THEN LEAVES THE QUARTERS.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

ALL OVER THE SHIP MUTED ALARM BUZZERS SOUND.  LANDO ANXIOUSLY WATCHES
THE FLASHING LIGHTS ON THE CONTROL PANEL AND HURRIEDLY ADJUSTS SOME
SWITCHES.  SEATED NEXT TO HIM, CHEWIE POINTS OUT A NEW BLIP APPEARING
ON THE PANEL.  LEIA, WATCHING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS, RECOGNIZES THE
SHAPE.

				LEIA
		STAR DESTROYER.

				LANDO
		ALL RIGHT, CHEWIE.  READY FOR
		LIGHT-SPEED.

				LEIA
		IF YOUR PEOPLE FIXED THE
		HYPERDRIVE.

ANOTHER EXPLOSION ROCKS THE SHIP.  LEIA NOTICES AS A GREEN LIGHT ON THE
PANEL NEXT TO HER FLASHES ON.

				LEIA
		ALL THE COORDINATES ARE SET.
		IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

CHEWIE BARKS IN AGREEMENT.

				LANDO
		PUNCH IT!

THE WOOKIEE SHRUGS AND PULLS BACK ON THE LIGHT-SPEED THROTTLE.  THE
SOUND OF THE ION ENGINE CHANGES...IT IS WINDING UP.  FACES ARE TENSE,
EXPECTANT.  BUT NOTHING HAPPENS, AND THE ENGINE GOES OFF.  CHEWIE LETS
OUT A FRUSTRATED HOWL.  THE FLAK STILL VIOLENTLY ROCKS THE SHIP.

				LANDO
		THEY TOLD ME THEY FIXED IT.  I
		TRUSTED THEM TO FIX IT.  IT'S NOT
		MY FAULT!

CHEWIE GETS UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND STARTS OUT OF THE COCKPIT.  HE GIVES
LANDO AND ANGRY SHOVE AS HE STORMS PAST HIM.

EXT. SPACE

IN THE DISTANCE THE TIE FIGHTERS CONTINUE THEIR CHASE, STILL SHOOTING
LASERS.  VADER'S STAR DESTROYER MOVES BEHIND THEM, DETERMINEDLY
FOLLOWING THE FALCON.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

VADER STANDS ON THE BRIDGE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AS ADMIRAL PIETT
APPROACHES HIM.

				PIETT
		THEY'LL BE IN RANGE OF OUR
		TRACTOR BEAM IN MOMENTS, MY LORD.

				VADER
		DID YOUR MEN DEACTIVATE THE
		HYPERDRIVE ON THE MILLENNIUM
		FALCON?

				PIETT
		YES, MY LORD.

				VADER
		GOOD.  PREPARE THE BOARDING PARTY
		AND SET YOUR WEAPONS FOR STUN.

				PIETT
		YES, MY LORD.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

BEEPING WHILE HE WORKS, ARTOO IS BUSY CONNECTING SOME WIRES TO THREEPIO
WHO NOW HAS ONE LEG ATTACHED.

CHEWIE ENTERS THROUGH THE DOORWAY, GRUNTING TO HIMSELF.

				THREEPIO
		NOISY BRUTE.  WHY DON'T WE JUST
		GO INTO LIGHT-SPEED?

ARTOO BEEPS IN RESPONSE.

				THREEPIO
		WE CAN'T?  HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THE
		HYPERDRIVE IS DEACTIVATED?

ARTOO WHISTLES KNOWINGLY.

				THREEPIO
		THE CITY'S CENTRAL COMPUTER TOLD
		YOU?  ARTOO-DETOO, YOU KNOW BETTER
		THAN TO TRUST A STRANGE COMPUTER.
		OUCH!  PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT

CHEWIE IS IN THE PIT.  HE IS TRYING TO LOOSEN SOMETHING WITH AN
ENORMOUS WRENCH.  FRUSTRATED, HE USES THE WRENCH LIKE A CLUB AND HITS

EPISODE VI
RETURN OF THE JEDI

LUKE SKYWALKER HAS RETURNED TO HIS HOME PLANET OF TATOOINE IN AN
ATTEMPT TO RESCUE HIS FRIEND HAN SOLO FROM THE CLUTCHES OF THE�VILE
GANGSTER JABBA THE HUTT. LITTLE DOES LUKE KNOW THAT THE GALACTIC EMPIRE
HAS SECRETLY BEGUN CONSTRUCTION ON A NEW ARMORED SPACE STATION EVEN
MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FIRST DREADED DEATH STAR. WHEN COMPLETED, THIS
ULTIMATE WEAPON WILL SPELL CERTAIN DOOM FOR THE SMALL BAND OF REBELS
STRUGGLING TO RESTORE FREEDOM TO THE GALAXY...

PAN DOWN TO REVEAL A MONSTROUS HALF-COMPLETED DEATH STAR, ITS MASSIVE
SUPERSTRUCTURE CURLING AWAY FROM THE COMPLETED SECTION LIKE THE ARMS OF
A GIANT OCTOPUS. BEYOND, IN BENEVOLENT CONTRAST, FLOATS THE SMALL,
GREEN MOON OF ENDOR.

AN IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER MOVES OVERHEAD TOWARD THE MASSIVE ARMORED
SPACE STATION, FOLLOWED BY TWO ZIPPING TIE FIGHTERS. A SMALL IMPERIAL
SHUTTLE ROCKETS FROM THE MAIN BAY OF THE SHIP AND HUSTLES TOWARD THE
DEATH STAR.

2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT
THE SHUTTLE CAPTAIN MAKES CONTACT WITH THE DEATH STAR.

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
COMMAND STATION, THIS IS ST 321. CODE CLEARANCE BLUE. WE'RE STARTING
OUR APPROACH. DEACTIVATE THE SECURITY SHIELD.

DEATH STAR CONTROLLER	(FILTERED VO)
THE SECURITY DEFLECTOR SHIELD WILL BE DEACTIVATED WHEN WE HAVE
CONFIRMATION OF YOUR CODE TRANSMISSION. STAND BY... YOU ARE CLEAR TO
PROCEED.

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
WE'RE STARTING OUR APPROACH.

3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

OPERATORS MOVE ABOUT AMONG THE CONTROL PANELS. A SHIELD OPERATOR HITS
SWITCHES BESIDE A LARGE SCREEN, ON WHICH IS A DISPLAY OF THE DEATH
STAR, THE MOON ENDOR, AND A BRIGHT WEB DELINEATING THE INVISIBLE
DEFLECTOR SHIELD.

A CONTROL OFFICER RUSHES OVER TO THE SHIELD OPERATOR.

OFFICER
INFORM THE COMMANDER THAT LORD VADER'S SHUTTLE HAS ARRIVED.

OPERATOR
YES, SIR.

THE CONTROL OFFICER MOVES TO A VIEW PORT AND WATCHES AS THE IMPERIAL
SHUTTLE LANDS IN THE MASSIVE DOCKING BAY. A SQUAD OF IMPERIAL
STORMTROOPERS MOVES INTO FORMATION BEFORE THE CRAFT.

4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY

THE DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, A TALL, CONFIDENT TECHNOCRAT,
STRIDES THROUGH THE ASSEMBLED TROOPS TO THE BASE OF THE SHUTTLE RAMP.
THE TROOPS SNAP TO ATTENTION; MANY ARE UNEASY ABOUT THE NEW ARRIVAL.
BUT THE DEATH STAR COMMANDER STANDS ARROGANTLY TALL.

THE EXIT HATCH OF THE SHUTTLE OPENS WITH A WHOOSH, REVEALING ONLY
DARKNESS. THEN, HEAVY FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. FROM THIS
BLACK VOID APPEARS DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. VADER LOOKS OVER THE
ASSEMBLAGE AS HE WALKS DOWN THE RAMP.

JERJERROD
LORD VADER, THIS IS AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE. WE'RE HONORED BY YOUR
PRESENCE.

VADER
YOU MAY DISPENSE WITH THE PLEASANTRIES, COMMANDER. I'M HERE TO PUT YOU
BACK ON
SCHEDULE.

THE COMMANDER TURNS ASHEN AND BEGINS TO SHAKE.

JERJERROD
I ASSURE YOU, LORD VADER, MY MEN ARE WORKING AS FAST AS THEY CAN.

VADER
PERHAPS I CAN FIND NEW WAYS TO MOTIVATE THEM.

JERJERROD
I TELL YOU, THIS STATION WILL BE OPERATIONAL AS PLANNED.

VADER
THE EMPEROR DOES NOT SHARE YOUR OPTIMISTIC APPRAISAL OF THE SITUATION.

JERJERROD
BUT HE ASKS THE IMPOSSIBLE. I NEED MORE MEN.

VADER
THEN PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL HIM WHEN HE ARRIVES.

JERJERROD	 (AGHAST)
THE EMPEROR'S COMING HERE?

VADER
THAT IS CORRECT, COMMANDER. AND HE IS MOST DISPLEASED WITH YOUR
APPARENT LACK OF PROGRESS.

JERJERROD
WE SHALL DOUBLE OUR EFFORTS.

VADER
I HOPE SO, COMMANDER, FOR YOUR SAKE. THE EMPEROR IS NOT AS FORGIVING AS
I AM.

5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE

A LONELY, WINDSWEPT ROAD MEANDERS THROUGH THE DESOLATE TATOOINE
TERRAIN. WE HEAR A FAMILIAR BEEPING AND A DISTINCTIVE REPLY BEFORE
CATCHING SIGHT OF ARTOO-DETOO AND SEE-THREEPIO, MAKING THEIR WAY ALONG
THE ROAD TOWARD THE OMINOUS PALACE OF JABBA THE HUTT.

THREEPIO
OF COURSE I'M WORRIED. AND YOU SHOULD BE, TOO. LANDO CALRISSIAN AND
POOR CHEWBACCA NEVER RETURNED FROM THIS AWFUL PLACE.

ARTOO WHISTLES TIMIDLY.

THREEPIO
DON'T BE SO SURE. IF I TOLD YOU HALF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS
JABBA THE HUTT, YOU'D PROBABLY SHORT-CIRCUIT.

THE TWO DROIDS FEARFULLY APPROACH THE MASSIVE GATE TO THE PALACE.

THREEPIO
ARTOO, ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE? I BETTER KNOCK, I SUPPOSE.

6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE

THREEPIO LOOKS AROUND FOR SOME KIND OF SIGNALING DEVICE, THEN TIMIDLY
KNOCKS ON THE IRON DOOR.

THREEPIO	 (INSTANTLY)
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANYONE THERE. LET'S GO BACK AND TELL MASTER
LUKE.

A SMALL HATCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOOR OPENS AND A SPIDERY MECHANICAL
ARM, WITH A LARGE ELECTRONIC EYEBALL ON THE END, POPS OUT AND INSPECTS
THE TWO DROIDS.

STRANGE VOICE
TEE CHUTA HHAT YUDD!

THREEPIO
GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME!

 THREEPIO POINTS TO ARTOO, THEN TO HIMSELF.

 THREEPIO
 ARTOO DETOOWHA BO SEETHREEPIOWHA EY TOOTA ODD MISCHKA JABBA DU HUTT.

THE EYE LOOKS FROM ONE ROBOT TO THE OTHER, THERE IS A LAUGH THEN THE
EYE ZIPS BACK INTO THE DOOR. THE HATCH SLAMS SHUT. ARTOO BEEPS HIS
CONCERN.

THREEPIO
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO LET US IN, ARTOO. WE'D BETTER GO.

ARTOO BEEPS HIS RELUCTANCE AS THREEPIO TURNS TO LEAVE. SUDDENLY THE
MASSIVE DOOR STARTS TO RISE WITH A HORRIFIC METALLIC SCREECH. THE
ROBOTS TURN BACK AND FACE AN ENDLESS BLACK CAVITY. THE DROIDS LOOK AT
ONE ANOTHER, AFRAID TO ENTER.

ARTOO STARTS FORWARD INTO THE GLOOM. THREEPIO RUSHES AFTER HIS STUBBY
COMPANION. THE DOOR LOWERS NOISILY BEHIND THEM.

THREEPIO
ARTOO, WAIT. OH, DEAR! ARTOO. ARTOO, I REALLY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
RUSH INTO ALL THIS.

ARTOO CONTINUES DOWN THE CORRIDOR, WITH THREEPIO FOLLOWING.

THREEPIO
OH, ARTOO!  ARTOO, WAIT FOR ME!

7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY

THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT WITH A LOUD CRASH THAT ECHOES THROUGHOUT THE DARK
PASSAGEWAY. THE FRIGHTENED ROBOTS ARE MET BY TWO GIANT, GREEN GAMORREAN
GUARDS, WHO FALL IN BEHIND THEM. THREEPIO GLANCES QUICKLY BACK AT THE
TWO LUMBERING BRUTES, THEN BACK TO ARTOO. ONE GUARD GRUNTS AN ORDER.
ARTOO BEEPS NERVOUSLY.

THREEPIO
JUST YOU DELIVER MASTER LUKE'S MESSAGE AND GET US OUT OF HERE. OH MY!
OH! OH, NO.

WALKING TOWARD THEM OUT OF THE DARKNESS IS BIB FORTUNA, A HUMANLIKE
ALIEN WITH LONG TENTACLES PROTRUDING FROM HIS SKULL.

BIB
DIE WANNA WANGA!

THREEPIO
OH, MY! DIE WANNA WAUAGA. WE -- WE BRING A MESSAGE TO YOUR MASTER,
JABBA THE HUTT.

ARTOO LETS OUT A SERIES OF QUICK BEEPS.

THREEPIO	 (CONT)
...AND A GIFT.
(THINKS A MOMENT, THEN TO ARTOO)
GIFT, WHAT GIFT?

BIB SHAKES HIS HEAD NEGATIVELY.

BIB
NEE JABBA NO BADDA. ME CHAADE SU GOODIE.

BIB HOLDS OUT HIS HAND TOWARD ARTOO AND THE TINY DROID BACKS UP A BIT,
LETTING OUT A PROTESTING ARRAY OF SQUEAKS. THREEPIO TURNS TO THE
STRANGE-LOOKING ALIEN.

THREEPIO
HE SAYS THAT OUR INSTRUCTIONS ARE TO GIVE IT ONLY TO JABBA HIMSELF.

BIB THINKS ABOUT THIS FOR A MOMENT.

THREEPIO
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. I'M AFRAID HE'S EVER SO STUBBORN ABOUT THESE SORT
OF THINGS.

BIB GESTURES FOR THE DROIDS TO FOLLOW.

BIB
NUDD CHAA.

THE DROIDS FOLLOW THE TALL, TENTACLED ALIEN INTO THE DARKNESS, TRAILED
BY THE TWO GUARDS.

THREEPIO
ARTOO, I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

THE THRONE ROOM IS FILLED WITH THE VILEST, MOST GROTESQUE CREATURES
EVER CONCEIVED IN THE UNIVERSE. ARTOO AND THREEPIO SEEM VERY SMALL AS
THEY PAUSE IN THE DOORWAY TO THE DIMLY LIT CHAMBER. LIGHT SHAFTS
PARTIALLY ILLUMINATE THE DRUNKEN COURTIERS AS BIB FORTUNA CROSSES THE
ROOM TO THE PLATFORM UPON WHICH RESTS THE LEADER OF THIS NAUSEATING
CROWD: JABBA THE HUTT. THE MONARCH OF THE GALACTIC UNDERWORLD IS A
REPULSIVE BLOB OF BLOATED FAT WITH A MANIACAL GRIN. CHAINED TO THE
HORRIBLE CREATURE IS THE BEAUTIFUL ALIEN FEMALE DANCER NAMED OOLA. AT
THE FOOT OF THE DAIS SITS AN OBNOXIOUS BIRDLIKE CREATURE, SALACIOUS
CRUMB. BIB WHISPERS SOMETHING IN THE SLOBBERING DEGENERATE'S EAR. JABBA
LAUGHS HORRIBLY, AT THE TWO TERRIFIED DROIDS BEFORE HIM. THREEPIO BOWS
POLITELY.

THREEPIO
GOOD MORNING.

JABBA
BO SHUDA!

THE ROBOTS JUMP FORWARD TO STAND BEFORE THE REPULSIVE, LOOSE-SKINNED
VILLAIN.

THREEPIO
THE MESSAGE, ARTOO, THE MESSAGE.

ARTOO WHISTLES, AND A BEAM OF LIGHT PROJECTS FROM HIS DOMED HEAD,
CREATING A HOLOGRAM OF LUKE ON THE FLOOR. THE IMAGE GROWS TO OVER TEN
FEET TALL, AND THE YOUNG JEDI TOWERS OVER THE SPACE GANGSTERS.

LUKE
GREETINGS, EXALTED ONE. ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF. I AM LUKE
SKYWALKER, JEDI KNIGHT AND FRIEND TO CAPTAIN SOLO. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE
POWERFUL, MIGHTY JABBA, AND THAT YOUR ANGER WITH SOLO MUST BE EQUALLY
POWERFUL. I SEEK AN AUDIENCE WITH YOUR GREATNESS TO BARGAIN FOR SOLO'S
LIFE.
(JABBA'S CROWD LAUGHS)
WITH YOUR WISDOM, I'M SURE THAT WE CAN WORK OUT AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH
WILL BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AND ENABLE US TO AVOID ANY UNPLEASANT
CONFRONTATION. AS A TOKEN OF MY GOODWILL, I PRESENT TO YOU A GIFT:
THESE TWO DROIDS.

THREEPIO IS STARTLED BY THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

THREEPIO
WHAT DID HE SAY?

LUKE	 (CONT)
... BOTH ARE HARDWORKING AND WILL SERVE YOU WELL.

THREEPIO
THIS CAN'T BE! ARTOO, YOU'RE PLAYING THE WRONG MESSAGE.

LUKE'S HOLOGRAM DISAPPEARS.

JABBA LAUGHS WHILE BIB SPEAKS TO HIM IN HUTTESE.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
THERE WILL BE NO BARGAIN.

THREEPIO
WE'RE DOOMED.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY FAVORITE DECORATION. I LIKE CAPTAIN SOLO WHERE HE
IS.

JABBA LAUGHS HIDEOUSLY AND LOOKS TOWARD AN ALCOVE BESIDE THE THRONE.
HANGING HIGH, FLAT AGAINST THE WALL, EXACTLY AS WE SAW HIM LAST, IS A
CARBONIZED HAN SOLO.

THREEPIO
ARTOO, LOOK! CAPTAIN SOLO. AND HE'S STILL FROZEN IN CARBONITE.

9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR

ONE OF JABBA'S GAMORREAN GUARDS MARCHES ARTOO AND THREEPIO DOWN A DANK,
SHADOWY PASSAGEWAY LINED WITH HOLDING CELLS. THE CRIES OF UNSPEAKABLE
CREATURES BOUNCE OFF THE COLD STONE WALLS. OCCASIONALLY A REPULSIVE ARM
OR TENTACLE GRABS THROUGH THE BARS AT THE HAPLESS DROIDS. ARTOO BEEPS
PITIFULLY.

THREEPIO
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE COME OVER MASTER LUKE. IS IT SOMETHING I DID?
HE NEVER EXPRESSED ANY UNHAPPINESS WITH MY WORK. OH! OH! HOLD IT! OHH!

A LARGE TENTACLE WRAPS AROUND THREEPIO'S NECK. HE MANAGES TO BREAK
FREE, AND THEY MOVE ON TO A DOOR AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR.

10   INT BOILER ROOM

THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN, REVEALING A ROOM FILLED WITH STEAM AND NOISY
MACHINERY. THE GUARD MOTIONS THEM INTO THE BOILER ROOM, WHERE THEY ARE
MET BY A TALL, THIN HUMANLIKE ROBOT NAMED EV-9D9. BEHIND THE ROBOT CAN
BE SEEN A TORTURE RACK PULLING THE LEGS OFF A SCREAMING BABY WORK
DROID. A SECOND POWER DROID IS UPSIDE DOWN.  AS SMOKING BRANDING IRONS
ARE PRESSED INTO HIS FEET, THE STUBBY ROBOT LETS OUT AN AGONIZED
ELECTRONIC SCREAM. ARTOO AND THREEPIO CRINGE AS THE GUARD GRUNTS TO EV-
9D9.

NINEDENINE
AH, GOOD. NEW ACQUISITIONS. YOU ARE A PROTOCOL DROID, ARE YOU NOT?

THREEPIO
I AM SEE-THREEPIO, HUMAN-CY...

NINEDENINE
YES OR NO WILL DO.

THREEPIO
OH. WELL, YES.

NINEDENINE
HOW MANY LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK?

THREEPIO
I AM FLUENT IN OVER SIX MILLION FORMS OF COMMUNICATION, AND CAN
READILY...

NINEDENINE
SPLENDID! WE HAVE BEEN WITHOUT AN INTERPRETER SINCE OUR MASTER GOT
ANGRY WITH OUR LAST PROTOCOL DROID AND DISINTEGRATED HIM.

THREEPIO
DISINTEGRATED?

NINEDENINE	 (TO A GAMORREAN GUARD)
GUARD! THIS PROTOCOL DROID MIGHT BE USEFUL. FIT HIM WITH A RESTRAINING
BOLT AND TAKE HIM BACK TO HIS EXCELLENCY'S MAIN AUDIENCE CHAMBER.

THE GUARD SHOVES THREEPIO TOWARD THE DOOR.

THREEPIO	 (DISAPPEARING)
ARTOO, DON'T LEAVE ME! OHHH!

ARTOO LETS OUT A PLAINTIVE CRY AS THE DOOR CLOSES. THEN HE BEEPS
ANGRILY.

NINEDENINE
YOU'RE A FEISTY LITTLE ONE, BUT YOU'LL SOON LEARN SOME RESPECT. I HAVE
NEED FOR YOU ON THE MASTER'S SAIL BARGE. AND I THINK YOU'LL FIT IN
NICELY.

THE POOR WORK DROID IN THE BACKGROUND LETS OUT ANOTHER TORTURED
ELECTRONIC SCREAM.

11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

THE COURT OF JABBA THE HUTT IS IN THE MIDST OF A DRUNKEN, RAUCOUS
PARTY. SLOPPY, SMELLY MONSTERS CHEER AND MAKE RUDE NOISES AS OOLA AND A
FAT FEMALE DANCER PERFORM IN FRONT OF JABBA'S THRONE.

JABBA LEERS AT THE DANCERS AND WITH A LUSTFUL GLEAM IN HIS EYE BECKONS
OOLA TO COME AND SIT WITH HIM. SHE STOPS DANCING AND BACKS AWAY,
SHAKING HER HEAD. JABBA GETS ANGRY AND POINTS TO A SPOT NEXT TO HIM.

JABBA
DA EITHA!

THE LOVELY ALIEN SHAKES HER HEAD AGAIN AND SCREAMS.

OOLA
NA CHUBA NEGATORIE NA! NA! NATOOTA...

JABBA IS FURIOUS AND PULLS HER TOWARD HIM, TUGGING ON THE CHAIN.

JABBA
BOSCKA!

HE PUSHES A BUTTON AND, BEFORE THE DANCER CAN FLEE, A TRAP DOOR IN THE
FLOOR SPRINGS OPEN AND SWALLOWS HER UP. AS THE DOOR SNAPS SHUT, A
MUFFLED GROWL IS FOLLOWED BY A HIDEOUS SCREAM. JABBA AND HIS MONSTROUS
FRIENDS LAUGH HYSTERICALLY AND SEVERAL REVELERS HURRY OVER TO WATCH HER
FATE THROUGH A GRATE.

THREEPIO CRINGES AND GLANCES WISTFULLY AT THE CARBONITE FORM OF HAN
SOLO, BUT IS IMMEDIATELY DISTRACTED BY A GUNSHOT OFFSCREEN.�AN
UNNATURAL QUIET SWEEPS THE BOISTEROUS GATHERING. ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE
ROOM, THE CRUSH OF DEBAUCHERS MOVES ASIDE TO ALLOW THE APPROACH OF TWO
GUARDS FOLLOWED BY BOUSHH, AN ODDLY CLOAKED BOUNTY HUNTER, LEADING HIS
CAPTIVE, HAN SOLO'S COPILOT, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.

BIB TAKES HIS PLACE NEXT TO HIS DISGUSTING MASTER, AND WHISPERS INTO
HIS EAR, POINTING AT CHEWBACCA AND THE BOUNTY HUNTER. JABBA LISTENS
INTENTLY, THEN THE BOUNTY HUNTER BOWS BEFORE THE GANGSTER AND SPEAKS A
GREETING IN A STRANGE, ELECTRONICALLY PROCESSED TONGUE (UBESE).

BOUSHH	 (IN UBESE SUBTITLED)
I HAVE COME FOR THE BOUNTY ON THIS WOOKIEE.

THREEPIO
OH, NO! CHEWBACCA!

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
AT LAST WE HAVE THE MIGHTY CHEWBACCA.

JABBA LETS OUT A LOUD, LONG, BLOOD-CURDLING LAUGH AND TURNS TO
THREEPIO, WAVING HIM CLOSER. THE RELUCTANT DROID OBEYS.

THREEPIO
OH, UH, YES, UH, I AM HERE, YOUR WORSHIPFULNESS. UH... YES!

JABBA CONTINUES SPEAKING, AS THREEPIO NERVOUSLY TRANSLATES. BOUSHH
LISTENS, STUDYING THE DANGEROUS CREATURES AROUND THE ROOM. HE NOTICES
BOBA FETT STANDING NEAR THE DOOR.

THREEPIO
OH. THE ILLUSTRIOUS JABBA BIDS YOU WELCOME AND WILL GLADLY PAY YOU THE
REWARD OF TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND.

BOUSHH	 (IN UBESE SUBTITLED)
I WANT FIFTY THOUSAND. NO LESS.

JABBA IMMEDIATELY FLIES INTO A RAGE, KNOCKING THE GOLDEN DROID OFF THE
RAISED THRONE INTO A CLATTERING HEAP ON THE FLOOR. BOUSHH ADJUSTS HIS
WEAPON AS JABBA RAVES IN HUTTESE AND THREEPIO STRUGGLES BACK ONTO THE
THRONE. THE DISHEVELED DROID TRIES TO COMPOSE HIMSELF.

THREEPIO
UH, OH... BUT WHAT, WHAT DID I SAY?
(TO BOUSHH)
UH, THE MIGHTY JABBA ASKS WHY HE MUST PAY FIFTY THOUSAND.

THE BOUNTY HUNTER HOLDS UP A SMALL SILVER BALL IN HIS HAND. THREEPIO
LOOKS AT IT, THEN LOOKS AT JABBA, THEN BACK TO THE BOUNTY HUNTER. THE
DROID IS VERY NERVOUS AND JABBA IS GETTING VERY IMPATIENT.

THREEPIO
BECAUSE HE'S HOLDING A THERMAL DETONATOR.

THE GUARDS INSTANTLY BACK AWAY, AS DO MOST OF THE OTHER MONSTERS IN THE
ROOM. JABBA STARES AT THE SILVER BALL, WHICH BEGINS TO GLOW IN THE
BOUNTY HUNTER'S HAND. THE ROOM HAS FALLEN INTO A TENSE HUSH. JABBA
STARES AT THE BOUNTY HUNTER MALEVOLENTLY UNTIL A SLY GRIN CREEPS ACROSS
HIS VAST MOUTH AND HE BEGINS TO LAUGH.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
THIS BOUNTY HUNTER IS MY KIND OF SCUM. FEARLESS AND INVENTIVE.

JABBA CONTINUES.

THREEPIO
JABBA OFFERS THE SUM OF THIRTY-FIVE. AND I SUGGEST YOU TAKE IT.

BIB AND THE OTHER MONSTERS STUDY THE BOUNTY HUNTER AND WAIT FOR HIS
REACTION. BOUSHH RELEASES A SWITCH ON THE THERMAL DETONATOR AND IT GOES
DEAD.

BOUSHH
ZEEBUSS.

THREEPIO
HE AGREES!

THE RAUCOUS CROWD OF MONSTERS ERUPTS IN A SYMPHONY OF CHEERS AND
APPLAUSE AS THE PARTY RETURNS TO ITS FULL NOISY PITCH. CHEWBACCA
GROWLS. AS HE IS LED AWAY WE SPOT LANDO CALRISSIAN, DISGUISED AS A
SKIFF GUARD IN A PARTIAL FACE MASK. THE BAND STARTS UP AND DANCING
GIRLS TAKE THE CENTER OF THE FLOOR, TO THE HOOTS OF THE LOUDLY
APPRECIATIVE CREATURES.

BOUSHH LEANS AGAINST A COLUMN WITH GUNFIGHTER COOL AND SURVEYS THE
SCENE, HIS GAZE STOPPING ONLY WHEN IT CONNECTS WITH A GLARE FROM ACROSS
THE ROOM. BOBA FETT IS WATCHING HIM. BOUSHH SHIFTS SLIGHTLY, CRADLING
HIS WEAPON LOVINGLY. BOBA FETT SHIFTS WITH EQUALLY OMINOUS ARROGANCE.

12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL

GAMORREAN GUARDS LEAD CHEWIE DOWN THE SAME HALLWAY WE SAW BEFORE. WHEN
A TENTACLE REACHES OUT AT THE WOOKIEE, CHEWIE'S FEROCIOUS ROAR ECHOES
AGAINST THE WALLS AND THE TENTACLE SNAPS BACK INTO ITS CELL IN TERROR.
IT TAKES ALL THE GUARDS TO HURL CHEWIE ROUGHLY INTO A CELL, SLAMMING
THE DOOR BEHIND HIM. CHEWIE LETS OUT A PATHETIC HOWL AND BANGS ON THE
IRON DOOR.

13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE

THE PALACE IS SITTING IN THE LIGHT OF THE DOUBLE SUNSET. ON THE ROAD IN
FRONT, A LARGE TOADLIKE CREATURE FLICKS ITS TONGUE OUT FOR A DESERT
RODENT AND BURPS IN SATISFACTION.

14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

SILENCE. THE ROOM IS DESERTED, ONLY THE AWFUL DEBRIS OF THE ALIEN
CELEBRATION GIVING MUTE WITNESS TO THE ACTIVITY HERE BEFORE. SEVERAL
DRUNK CREATURES LIE UNCONSCIOUS AROUND THE ROOM, SNORING LOUDLY.

A SHADOWY FIGURE MOVES STEALTHILY AMONG THE COLUMNS AT THE PERIMETER OF
THE ROOM AND IS REVEALED TO BE BOUSHH, THE BOUNTY HUNTER. HE PICKS HIS
WAY CAREFULLY THROUGH THE SNORING, DRUNKEN MONSTERS.

HAN SOLO, THE FROZEN SPACE PIRATE, HANGS SPOTLIGHTED ON THE WALL, HIS
COFFIN-LIKE CASE SUSPENDED BY A FORCE FIELD. THE BOUNTY HUNTER
DEACTIVATES THE FORCE FIELD BY FLIPPING A CONTROL SWITCH TO ONE SIDE OF
THE COFFIN. THE HEAVY CASE SLOWLY LOWERS TO THE FLOOR OF THE ALCOVE.

BOUSHH STEPS UP TO THE CASE, STUDYING HAN, AND THEN TURNS TO THE
CONTROLS ON THE SIDE OF THE COFFIN. HE ACTIVATES A SERIES OF SWITCHES
AND, AFTER ONE LAST HESITANT LOOK AT HAN, SLIDES THE DE-CARBONIZATION
LEVER. THE CASE BEGINS TO EMIT A SOUND AS THE HARD SHELL COVERING THE
CONTOURS OF HAN'S FACE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. THE BOUNTY HUNTER WATCHES
AS HAN'S BODY IS FREED OF ITS METALLIC COAT AND HIS FOREARMS AND HANDS,
PREVIOUSLY RAISED IN REFLEXIVE PROTEST, DROP SLACKLY TO HIS SIDE. HIS
FACE MUSCLES RELAX FROM THEIR MASK OF HORROR. HE APPEARS QUITE DEAD.

BOUSHH'S UGLY HELMET LEANS CLOSE TO HAN'S FACE LISTENING FOR THE BREATH
OF LIFE. NOTHING. HE WAITS. HAN'S EYES POP OPEN WITH A START AND HE
BEGINS COUGHING. THE BOUNTY HUNTER STEADIES THE STAGGERING NEWBORN.

BOUSHH
JUST RELAX FOR A MOMENT. YOU'RE FREE OF THE CARBONITE.

HAN TOUCHES HIS FACE WITH HIS HAND AND MOANS.

BOUSHH
SHHH. YOU HAVE HIBERNATION SICKNESS.

HAN
I CAN'T SEE.

BOUSHH
YOUR EYESIGHT WILL RETURN IN TIME.

HAN
WHERE AM I?

BOUSHH
JABBA'S PALACE.

HAN
WHO ARE YOU?

THE BOUNTY HUNTER REACHES UP AND LIFTS THE HELMET FROM HIS HEAD,
REVEALING THE BEAUTIFUL FACE OF PRINCESS LEIA.

LEIA
SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU.

HAN
LEIA!

LEIA
I GOTTA GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

AS LEIA HELPS HER WEAKENED LOVER TO STAND UP, THE RELATIVE QUIET IS
PIERCED BY AN OBSCENE HUTTESE CACKLE FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ALCOVE.

HAN
WHAT'S THAT? I KNOW THAT LAUGH.

THE CURTAIN ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ALCOVE OPENS, REVEALING JABBA THE
HUTT, SURROUNDED BY BIB AND OTHER ALIENS. HE LAUGHS AGAIN, AND HIS
GROSS CRONIES JOIN IN A CACOPHONY OF ALIEN GLEE.

HAN
HEY, JABBA. LOOK, JABBA, I WAS JUST ON MY WAY TO PAY YOU BACK, BUT I
GOT A LITTLE SIDETRACKED. IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

JABBA LAUGHS.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT, SOLO. YOU MAY HAVE BEEN A GOOD SMUGGLER, BUT
NOW YOU'RE BANTHA FODDER.

HAN
LOOK...

JABBA	 (CONT HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
TAKE HIM AWAY!

THE GUARDS GRAB HAN AND START TO LEAD HIM AWAY.

HAN
JABBA... I'LL PAY YOU TRIPLE! YOU'RE THROWING AWAY A FORTUNE HERE.
DON'T BE A FOOL!

HAN IS DRAGGED OFF, AS LANDO QUICKLY MOVES FORWARD AND ATTEMPTS TO LEAD
LEIA AWAY.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
BRING HER TO ME.

JABBA CHUCKLES AS LANDO AND A SECOND GUARD DRAG THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
PRINCESS TOWARD HIM. THREEPIO PEEKS FROM BEHIND A MONSTER AND QUICKLY
TURNS AWAY IN DISGUST.

LEIA
WE HAVE POWERFUL FRIENDS. YOU'RE GONNA REGRET THIS...

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
I'M SURE.

INEXORABLY HER LOVELY FACE MOVES TO WITHIN A FEW INCHES OF JABBA'S UGLY
BLOB OF A HEAD, AND LEIA TURNS AWAY IN DISGUST.

LEIA
UGH!

THREEPIO
OHHH, I CAN'T BEAR TO WATCH.

15   INT DUNGEON CELL

THE HEAVY METAL DOOR OF THE DUNGEON WHINES AND SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN. A
GUARD THROWS THE BLINDED STAR CAPTAIN INTO THE DARK CELL AND THE DOOR
SLAMS SHUT BEHIND HIM, LEAVING ONLY A THIN SLIVER OF LIGHT FROM A CRACK
IN THE DOOR. HAN IS TRYING TO COLLECT HIMSELF WHEN SUDDENLY A GROWL IS
HEARD FROM THE FAR SIDE OF THE CELL. HE JUMPS BACK AGAINST THE CELL
DOOR AND LISTENS.

HAN
CHEWIE? CHEWIE, IS THAT YOU?

THE SHADOWY FIGURE LETS OUT A CRAZY YELL AND RACES TOWARD HAN, LIFTING
HIM OFF THE GROUND WITH A BIG HUG THAT CARRIES THEM INTO THE LIGHT,
REVEALING CHEWIE.

HAN
AH! CHEW--CHEWIE!

THE GIANT WOOKIEE BARKS WITH GLEE.

HAN
WAIT. I CAN'T SEE, PAL. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

CHEWIE BARKS AN EXCITED BLUE STREAK.

HAN
LUKE? LUKE'S CRAZY. HE CAN'T EVEN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF, MUCH LESS
RESCUE ANYBODY.

CHEWIE BARKS A REPLY.

HAN
A...JEDI KNIGHT? I--I'M OUT OF IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE, EVERYBODY GETS
DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR.

CHEWIE GROWLS INSISTENTLY. HE HOLDS HAN TO HIS CHEST AND PETS HIS HEAD.

HAN
I'M ALL RIGHT, PAL. I'M ALL RIGHT.

16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE

NOISILY, THE MAIN GATE LIFTS TO FLOOD THE BLACKNESS WITH BLINDING LIGHT
AND REVEAL THE SILHOUETTED FIGURE OF LUKE SKYWALKER. HE IS CLAD IN A
ROBE SIMILAR TO BEN'S AND WEARS NEITHER PISTOL NOR LASER SWORD. LUKE
STRIDES PURPOSEFULLY INTO THE HALLWAY. TWO GIANT GUARDS MOVE TO BLOCK
LUKE'S PATH. LUKE HALTS.

LUKE RAISES HIS HAND AND POINTS AT THE PUZZLED GUARDS, WHO IMMEDIATELY
LOWER THEIR SPEARS AND FALL BACK. THE YOUNG JEDI LOWERS HIS HAND AND
MOVES ON DOWN THE HALLWAY.

BIB FORTUNA APPEARS OUT OF THE GLOOM. HE SPEAKS TO LUKE AS THEY
APPROACH EACH OTHER, BUT LUKE DOESN'T STOP AND BIB MUST REVERSE HIS
DIRECTION AND HURRY ALONGSIDE THE YOUNG JEDI IN ORDER TO CARRY ON THE
CONVERSATION. SEVERAL OTHER GUARDS FALL IN BEHIND THEM IN THE DARKNESS.

LUKE
I MUST SPEAK WITH JABBA.

BIB ANSWERS IN HUTTESE, SHAKING HIS HEAD IN DENIAL. LUKE STOPS AND
STARES AT BIB; HE RAISES HIS HAND SLIGHTLY.

LUKE
YOU WILL TAKE ME TO JABBA NOW!

BIB TURNS IN HYPNOTIC RESPONSE TO LUKE'S COMMAND, AND LUKE FOLLOWS HIM
INTO THE GLOOM.

LUKE
YOU SERVE YOUR MASTER WELL.

BIB RESPONDS.

LUKE
AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

JABBA IS ASLEEP ON HIS THRONE, WITH LEIA LYING IN FRONT OF HIM.
SALACIOUS SITS BY JABBA'S TAIL, WATCHING IT WRIGGLE. LEIA IS NOW
DRESSED IN THE SKIMPY COSTUME OF A DANCING GIRL; A CHAIN RUNS FROM A
MANACLE/NECKLACE AT HER THROAT TO HER NEW MASTER, JABBA THE HUTT.
THREEPIO STANDS BEHIND JABBA AS BIB COMES UP TO THE GANGSTER SLUG.

THREEPIO
AT LAST! MASTER LUKE'S COME TO RESCUE ME.

BIB
MASTER.

JABBA AWAKENS WITH A START AND BIB CONTINUES, IN HUTTESE.

BIB
...LUKE SKYWALKER, JEDI KNIGHT.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
I TOLD YOU NOT TO ADMIT HIM.

LUKE
I MUST BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK.

BIB	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
HE MUST BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK.

JABBA, FURIOUS, CLOBBERS BIB AND SHOVES HIM AWAY.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
YOU WEAK-MINDED FOOL! HE'S USING AN OLD JEDI MIND TRICK.

LUKE STARES HARD AT JABBA.

LUKE
YOU WILL BRING CAPTAIN SOLO AND THE WOOKIEE TO ME.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
YOUR MIND POWERS WILL NOT WORK ON ME, BOY.

LUKE
NEVERTHELESS, I'M TAKING CAPTAIN SOLO AND HIS FRIENDS. YOU CAN EITHER
PROFIT BY THIS... OR BE DESTROYED! IT'S YOUR CHOICE. BUT I WARN YOU NOT
TO UNDERESTIMATE MY POWERS.

JABBA'S LAUGH IS MEAN AND LOUD. THREEPIO ATTEMPTS TO WARN LUKE ABOUT
THE PIT.

THREEPIO
MASTER LUKE, YOU'RE STANDING ON...

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
THERE WILL BE NO BARGAIN, YOUNG JEDI. I SHALL ENJOY WATCHING YOU DIE.

LUKE REACHES OUT, AND A PISTOL JUMPS OUT OF A GUARD'S HOLSTER AND FLIES
INTO LUKE'S HAND. THE BEWILDERED GUARD GRABS FOR IT AS JABBA RAISES HIS
HAND.

JABBA
BASCKA!

THE FLOOR SUDDENLY DROPS AWAY, SENDING LUKE AND THE HAPLESS GUARD INTO
THE PIT. THE PISTOL GOES OFF, BLASTING A HOLE IN THE CEILING. JABBA
LAUGHS AND HIS COURTIERS JOIN IN. LEIA STARTS FORWARD BUT IS RESTRAINED
BY A HUMAN GUARD-- LANDO, RECOGNIZABLE BEHIND HIS MASK. SHE LOOKS AT
HIM AND HE SHAKES HIS HEAD "NO."

18   INT RANCOR PIT

LUKE AND THE GUARD HAVE DROPPED TWENTY-FIVE FEET FROM A CHUTE INTO THE
DUNGEONLIKE CAGE. LUKE GETS TO HIS FEET AS THE GUARD YELLS HYSTERICALLY
FOR HELP. A CROWD GATHERS UP AROUND THE EDGE OF THE PIT AS THE DOOR IN
THE SIDE OF THE PIT STARTS TO RUMBLE OPEN. THE GUARD SCREAMS IN PANIC.
LUKE LOOKS CALMLY AROUND FOR A MEANS OF ESCAPE.

THREEPIO
OH, NO! THE RANCOR!

AT THE SIDE OF THE PIT, AN IRON DOOR RUMBLES UPWARD AND A GIANT, FANGED
RANCOR EMERGES. THE GUARD RUNS TO THE SIDE OF THE PIT AND TRIES
FUTILELY TO SCRAMBLE TO THE TOP. THE HIDEOUS BEAST CLOSES IN ON HIM.

THE RANCOR MOVES PAST LUKE, AND AS THE GUARD CONTINUES TO SCRAMBLE, THE
RANCOR PICKS HIM UP AND POPS HIM INTO ITS SLAVERING JAWS. A FEW
SCREAMS, AND THE GUARD IS SWALLOWED WITH A GULP. THE AUDIENCE CHEERS
AND LAUGHS AT THE GUARD'S FATE.

THE MONSTER TURNS AND STARTS FOR LUKE. THE YOUNG JEDI DASHES AWAY JUST
AHEAD OF THE MONSTER'S SWIPE AT HIM, AND PICKS UP THE LONG ARM BONE OF
AN EARLIER VICTIM. THE MONSTER GRABS LUKE AND BRINGS HIM UP TO HIS
SALIVATING MOUTH. AT THE LAST MOMENT, LUKE WEDGES THE BONE IN THE
MONSTER'S MOUTH AND IS DROPPED TO THE FLOOR. THE MONSTER BELLOWS IN
RAGE AND FLAILS ABOUT, HITTING THE SIDE OF THE PIT, CAUSING AN
AVALANCHE.

THE MONSTER CRUSHES THE BONE IN ITS JAWS AND SEES LUKE, WHO SQUEEZES
INTO A CREVICE IN THE PIT WALL. LUKE LOOKS PAST THE MONSTER TO THE
HOLDING CAVE BEYOND. ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE HOLDING CAVE IS A UTILITY
DOOR--IF ONLY HE CAN GET TO IT. THE RANCOR SPOTS LUKE AND REACHES INTO
THE CREVICE FOR HIM. LUKE GRABS A LARGE ROCK AND RAISES IT, SMASHING IT
DOWN ON THE RANCOR'S FINGER.

19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT

THE RANCOR LETS OUT A LOUD HOWL AS LUKE MAKES A RUN FOR THE HOLDING
CAVE. HE REACHES THE DOOR AND PUSHES A BUTTON TO OPEN IT. WHEN HE
SUCCEEDS, HE SEES A HEAVY BARRED GATE BETWEEN HIM AND SAFETY. BEYOND
THE GATE TWO GUARDS LOOK UP FROM THEIR DINNER. LUKE TURNS TO SEE THE
MONSTER HEADING FOR HIM, AND PULLS WITH ALL HIS MIGHT ON THE GATE. THE
GUARDS MOVE TO THE GATE AND START POKING AT THE YOUNG JEDI WITH SPEARS,
LAUGHING.

LUKE CROUCHES (AGAINST THE WALL) AS THE MONSTER STARTS TO REACH FOR
HIM. SUDDENLY HE NOTICES A MAIN DOOR CONTROL PANEL HALFWAY UP THE WALL.
AS THE RANCOR MOVES IN FOR THE KILL, LUKE PICKS UP A SKULL FROM THE
CAVE FLOOR AND HURLS IT AT THE PANEL. THE GIANT OVERHEAD DOOR COMES
CRASHING DOWN ON THE BEAST'S HEAD, SQUASHING IT LIKE A SLEDGEHAMMER ON
AN EGG.

A STARTLED GASP IS HEARD FROM THE STUNNED COURT. THERE'S CONSTERNATION
AT THIS TURN OF EVENTS. HEADS LOOK TO JABBA, WHO IS ACTUALLY TURNING
RED WITH ANGER. LEIA CANNOT SUPPRESS HER JOY. JABBA UTTERS HARSH
COMMANDS TO HIS GUARDS AND THEY HURRY OFF.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
BRING ME SOLO AND THE WOOKIEE. THEY WILL ALL SUFFER FOR THIS OUTRAGE.

21   INT RANCOR PIT

THE RANCOR KEEPERS HAVE COME INTO THE CAGE AND ARE EXAMINING THEIR DEAD
BEAST. ONE OF THEM BREAKS DOWN AND WEEPS. THE OTHER GLARES MENACINGLY
AT LUKE, WHO IS UNWORRIED. SEVERAL GUARDS RUSH INTO THE HOLDING TUNNEL
AND TAKE LUKE AWAY.

22   INT THRONE ROOM

THE CROWD OF CREEPY COURTIERS PARTS AS HAN AND CHEWIE ARE BROUGHT INTO
THE THRONE ROOM, AND OTHER GUARDS DRAG LUKE UP THE STEPS.

LUKE
HAN!

HAN
LUKE!

LUKE
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

HAN
FINE. TOGETHER AGAIN, HUH?

LUKE
WOULDN'T MISS IT.

HAN
HOW ARE WE DOING?

LUKE
THE SAME AS ALWAYS.

HAN
THAT BAD, HUH? WHERE'S LEIA?

LUKE LOOKS TO LEIA.

LEIA
I'M HERE.

THREEPIO IS STANDING BEHIND THE GROTESQUE GANGSTER AS HE STROKES LEIA
LIKE A PET CAT. SEVERAL OF THE GUARDS, INCLUDING LANDO, BRING LUKE FROM
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM. BOBA IS STANDING BEHIND JABBA.

THREEPIO STEPS FORWARD AND TRANSLATES FOR THE CAPTIVES.

THREEPIO
OH, DEAR. HIS HIGH EXALTEDNESS, THE GREAT JABBA THE HUTT, HAS DECREED
THAT YOU ARE TO BE TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY.

HAN
GOOD, I HATE LONG WAITS.

THREEPIO
YOU WILL THEREFORE BE TAKEN TO THE DUNE SEA AND CAST INTO THE PIT OF
CARKOON, THE NESTING PLACE OF THE ALL-POWERFUL SARLACC.

HAN	 (TO LUKE)
DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.

THREEPIO
IN HIS BELLY, YOU WILL FIND A NEW DEFINITION OF PAIN AND SUFFERING, AS
YOU ARE SLOWLY DIGESTED OVER A THOUSAND YEARS.

HAN
ON SECOND THOUGHT, LET'S PASS ON THAT, HUH?

CHEWIE BARKS HIS AGREEMENT.

LUKE
YOU SHOULD HAVE BARGAINED, JABBA. THAT'S THE LAST MISTAKE YOU'LL EVER
MAKE.

JABBA CACKLES EVILLY AT THIS.

AS THE GUARDS DRAG THE PRISONERS FROM THE THRONE ROOM, A LOUD CHEER
RISES FROM THE CROWD. LEIA AND CHEWIE EXCHANGE CONCERNED LOOKS, BUT
LUKE SKYWALKER, JEDI WARRIOR, CANNOT SUPPRESS A SMILE.

23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF

JABBA'S HUGE SAIL BARGE MOVES ABOVE THE DESERT SURFACE ACCOMPANIED BY
TWO SMALLER SKIFFS. ONE OF THE SKIFFS GLIDES CLOSE, REVEALING LUKE,
HAN, AND CHEWIE -- ALL IN BONDS -- SURROUNDED BY GUARDS, ONE OF WHOM IS
LANDO IN DISGUISE.

HAN
I THINK MY EYES ARE GETTING BETTER. INSTEAD OF A BIG DARK BLUR, I SEE A
BIG LIGHT BLUR.

LUKE
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE. I USED TO LIVE HERE, YOU KNOW.

HAN
YOU'RE GONNA DIE HERE, YOU KNOW. CONVENIENT.

LUKE
JUST STICK CLOSE TO CHEWIE AND LANDO. I'VE TAKEN CARE OF EVERYTHING.

HAN
OH... GREAT!

24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

JABBA THE HUTT RIDES LIKE A SULTAN IN THE MASSIVE ANTIGRAVITY SHIP. HIS
ENTIRE RETINUE IS WITH HIM, DRINKING, EATING, AND HAVING A GOOD TIME.
LEIA IS WATCHING HER FRIENDS IN THE SKIFF WHEN THE CHAIN ATTACHED TO
HER NECK IS PULLED TIGHT AND JABBA TUGS THE SCANTILY CLAD PRINCESS TO
HIM.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
SOON YOU WILL LEARN TO APPRECIATE ME.

THREEPIO WANDERS AMONG THE SAIL BARGE ALIENS, BUMPING INTO A SMALLER
DROID SERVING DRINKS, SPILLING THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE STUBBY
DROID LETS OUT AN ANGRY SERIES OF BEEPS AND WHISTLES.

THREEPIO
OH, I'M TERRIBLY SOR... ARTOO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

ARTOO BEEPS A QUICK REPLY.

THREEPIO
WELL, I CAN SEE YOU'RE SERVING DRINKS, BUT THIS PLACE IS DANGEROUS.
THEY'RE GOING TO EXECUTE MASTER LUKE AND, IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, US TOO!

ARTOO WHISTLES A SINGSONG RESPONSE.

THREEPIO
HMM.  I WISH I HAD YOUR CONFIDENCE.

25   EXT SARLACC PIT

THE CONVOY MOVES UP OVER A HUGE SAND PIT. THE SAIL BARGE STOPS TO ONE
SIDE OF THE DEPRESSION, AS DOES THE ESCORT SKIFF. BUT THE PRISONER'S
SKIFF MOVES OUT DIRECTLY OVER THE CENTER AND HOVERS. AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE DEEP CONE OF SAND IS A REPULSIVE, MUCOUS-LINED HOLE, SURROUNDED BY
THOUSANDS OF NEEDLE-SHARP TEETH. THIS IS THE SARLACC. A PLANK IS
EXTENDED FROM THE EDGE OF THE PRISONER'S SKIFF. GUARDS RELEASE LUKE'S
BONDS AND SHOVE HIM OUT ONTO THE PLANK ABOVE THE SARLACC'S MOUTH.

26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

JABBA AND LEIA ARE NOW BY THE RAIL, WATCHING. THREEPIO LEANS FORWARD
AND THE SLOBBERING VILLAIN MUMBLES SOMETHING TO HIM. AS THREEPIO STEPS
UP TO A COMLINK, JABBA RAISES HIS ARM AND THE MOTLEY ARRAY OF
INTERGALACTIC PIRATES FALL SILENT. THREEPIO'S VOICE IS AMPLIFIED ACROSS
LOUDSPEAKERS.

THREEPIO
VICTIMS OF THE ALMIGHTY SARLACC: HIS EXCELLENCY HOPES THAT YOU WILL DIE
HONORABLY. BUT SHOULD ANY OF YOU WISH TO BEG FOR MERCY, THE GREAT JABBA
THE HUTT WILL NOW LISTEN TO YOUR PLEAS.

27   EXT SKIFF

HAN STEPS FORWARD ARROGANTLY AND BEGINS TO SPEAK.

HAN
THREEPIO, YOU TELL THAT SLIMY PIECE OF... WORM-RIDDEN FILTH HE'LL GET
NO SUCH PLEASURE FROM US. RIGHT?

CHEWIE GROWLS HIS AGREEMENT.

LUKE
JABBA! THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. FREE US OR DIE.

LANDO MOVES UNOBTRUSIVELY ALONG THE SKIFF AS LUKE SHOOTS A QUICK LOOK
OF CONSPIRACY TO HIM.

28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

THE ASSEMBLED MONSTERS ROCK WITH MOCKING LAUGHTER AS ARTOO ZIPS
UNNOTICED UP THE RAMP TO THE UPPER DECK. JABBA'S LAUGHTER SUBSIDES AS
HE SPEAKS INTO THE COMLINK.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
MOVE HIM INTO POSITION.

JABBA MAKES A THUMBS-DOWN GESTURE. LEIA LOOKS WORRIED.

29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK

ARTOO APPEARS FROM BELOW AND ZIPS OVER TO THE RAIL FACING THE PIT.
BELOW, IN THE SKIFF, LUKE IS PRODDED BY A GUARD TO THE EDGE OF THE
PLANK OVER THE GAPING SARLACC. LUKE LOOKS UP AT ARTOO, THEN GIVES A
JAUNTY SALUTE: THE SIGNAL THE LITTLE DROID HAS BEEN WAITING FOR. A FLAP
OPENS IN ARTOO'S DOMED HEAD.

JABBA	 (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)
PUT HIM IN.

30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK

LUKE IS PRODDED AND JUMPS OFF THE PLANK TO THE CHEERS OF THE
BLOODTHIRSTY SPECTATORS. BUT, BEFORE ANYONE CAN EVEN PERCEIVE WHAT IS
HAPPENING, HE SPINS AROUND AND GRABS THE END OF THE PLANK BY HIS
FINGERTIPS. THE PLANK BENDS WILDLY FROM HIS WEIGHT AND CATAPULTS HIM
SKYWARD. IN MIDAIR HE DOES A COMPLETE FLIP AND DROPS DOWN ON THE END OF
THE PLANK IN THE SAME SPOT HE JUST VACATED, BUT FACING THE SKIFF. HE
CASUALLY EXTENDS AN OPEN PALM AND -- HIS LIGHTSABER, WHICH ARTOO HAS
SENT ARCING TOWARD HIM, DROPS INTO HIS HAND.

WITH SAMURAI SPEED, LUKE IGNITES IT AND ATTACKS THE GUARD WHO PRODDED
HIM OFF THE PLANK, SENDING THE HAPLESS MONSTER SCREAMING OVERBOARD. THE
OTHER GUARDS SWARM TOWARD LUKE. HE WADES INTO THEM, LIGHTSABER
FLASHING. LANDO STRUGGLES WITH ANOTHER GUARD AT THE BACK OF THE SKIFF.

31   EXT SARLACC PIT

A BEWILDERED GUARD LANDS IN THE SOFT, SANDY SLOPE OF THE PIT, AND
BEGINS SLIDING. HE CLAWS DESPERATELY AS A SARLACC TENTACLE GRABS HIM
AND PULLS HIM SCREAMING INTO THE VISCOUS MOUTH.

32   INT SAIL BARGE

JABBA WATCHES THIS AND EXPLODES IN RAGE. HE BARKS COMMANDS, AND THE
GUARDS AROUND HIM RUSH OFF TO DO HIS BIDDING. THE SCUZZY CREATURES
WATCHING THE ACTION FROM THE WINDOW ARE IN AN UPROAR.

33   EXT SKIFF

LUKE KNOCKS ANOTHER GUARD OFF THE SKIFF AND INTO THE WAITING MOUTH OF
THE SARLACC. HE STARTS TO UNTIE CHEWIE'S BONDS.

LUKE
EASY, CHEWIE.

AT THAT MOMENT, THE DECK GUNMEN ON THE BARGE UNLEASH A SERIES OF BLASTS
FROM A BIG CANNON ON THE UPPER DECK. LANDO IS TOSSED FROM THE DECK OF
THE ROCKING SKIFF. HE MANAGES TO GRAB A ROPE, AND DANGLES DESPERATELY
ABOVE THE SARLACC PIT.

LANDO
WHOA! WHOA! HELP!

34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

WITH TWO SWIFT STRIDES, THE DANGEROUS BOBA FETT IGNITES HIS ROCKET
PACK, LEAPS INTO THE AIR, AND FLIES FROM THE BARGE DOWN TO THE SKIFF.

35   EXT SKIFF

BOBA LANDS ON THE SKIFF AND STARTS TO AIM HIS LASER GUN AT LUKE, WHO
HAS FREED HAN AND CHEWIE FROM THEIR BONDS. BUT BEFORE BOBA CAN FIRE,
THE YOUNG JEDI SPINS ON HIM, LIGHTSABER SWEEPING, AND HACKS THE BOUNTY
HUNTER'S GUN IN HALF.

IMMEDIATELY, THE SKIFF TAKES ANOTHER DIRECT HIT FROM THE BARGE'S DECK
GUN. SHARDS OF SKIFF DECK FLY. CHEWIE AND HAN ARE THROWN AGAINST THE
RAIL.

HAN
CHEWIE, YOU OKAY? WHERE IS HE?

THE WOOKIEE IS WOUNDED AND HE HOWLS IN PAIN.

HAN
I'M OKAY, PAL.

FOR A MOMENT, LUKE IS DISTRACTED, AND IN THAT MOMENT, BOBA FIRES A
CABLE OUT OF HIS ARMORED SLEEVE. INSTANTLY, LUKE IS WRAPPED IN A STRONG
CABLE, HIS ARMS PINNED AGAINST HIS SIDE, HIS SWORD ARM FREE ONLY FROM
THE WRIST DOWN.  LUKE BENDS HIS WRIST SO THE LIGHTSABER POINTS STRAIGHT
UP TO REACH THE WIRE LASSO AND CUTS THROUGH. LUKE SHRUGS AWAY THE CABLE
AND STANDS FREE.

ANOTHER BLAST FROM THE BARGE'S DECK GUN HITS NEAR BOBA AND HE IS
KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS TO THE DECK, NEXT TO WHERE LANDO IS HANGING.

LANDO
HAN! CHEWIE?

HAN
LANDO!

LUKE IS A LITTLE SHAKEN BUT REMAINS STANDING AS A FUSILLADE BRACKETS
HIM. THE SECOND SKIFF, LOADED WITH GUARDS FIRING THEIR WEAPONS, MOVES
IN ON LUKE FAST. LUKE LEAPS TOWARD THE INCOMING SECOND SKIFF. THE YOUNG
JEDI LEAPS INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND SKIFF AND BEGINS DECIMATING
THE GUARDS FROM THEIR MIDST.

CHEWIE, WOUNDED, TRIES TO LIFT HIMSELF AS HE BARKS DIRECTIONS TO HAN,
GUIDING HIM TOWARD A SPEAR WHICH HAS BEEN DROPPED BY ONE OF THE GUARDS.
HAN SEARCHES THE DECK AS CHEWIE BARKS DIRECTIONS; FINALLY HE GRABS HOLD
OF THE SPEAR.

BOBA FETT, BADLY SHAKEN, RISES FROM THE DECK. HE LOOKS OVER AT THE
OTHER SKIFF, WHERE LUKE IS WHIPPING A MASS OF GUARDS. BOBA RAISES HIS
ARM, AND AIMS HIS LETHAL APPENDAGE.

CHEWIE BARKS DESPERATELY AT HAN.

HAN
BOBA FETT?! BOBA FETT?! WHERE?

THE SPACE PIRATE TURNS AROUND BLINDLY, AND THE LONG SPEAR IN HIS HAND
WHACKS SQUARELY IN THE MIDDLE OF BOBA'S ROCKET PACK.

THE IMPACT OF THE SWING CAUSES THE ROCKET PACK TO IGNITE. BOBA BLASTS
OFF, FLYING OVER THE SECOND SKIFF LIKE A MISSILE, SMASHING AGAINST THE
SIDE OF THE HUGE SAIL BARGE AND SLIDING AWAY INTO THE PIT. HE SCREAMS
AS HIS ARMORED BODY MAKES ITS LAST FLIGHT PAST LANDO AND DIRECTLY INTO
THE MUCOUS MOUTH OF THE SARLACC. THE SARLACC BURPS. CHEWIE GROWLS A
WEAK CONGRATULATIONS TO HAN.

36   INT SAIL BARGE

LEIA TURNS FROM THE SPECTACLE OUTSIDE, LEAPS ONTO JABBA'S THRONE, AND
THROWS THE CHAIN THAT ENSLAVES HER OVER HIS HEAD AROUND HIS BULBOUS
NECK. THEN SHE DIVES OFF THE OTHER SIDE OF THE THRONE, PULLING THE
CHAIN VIOLENTLY IN HER GRASP. JABBA'S FLACCID NECK CONTRACTS BENEATH
THE TIGHTENING CHAIN. HIS HUGE EYES BULGE FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND HIS
SCUM-COATED TONGUE FLOPS OUT. THE EXALTED HUTT'S HUGE TAIL SPASMS
THROUGH ITS DEATH THROES AND THEN SLAMS DOWN INTO FINAL STILLNESS. LEIA
STRUGGLES TO FREE HERSELF OF HER BONDAGE.

37   EXT SKIFF

LUKE CONTINUES TO DESTROY THE ALIENS ON THE GUARDS' SKIFF, AS HAN
EXTENDS HIS SPEAR DOWNWARD TO LANDO, WHO IS STILL DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY
FROM A ROPE ON THE PRISONER'S SKIFF.

HAN
LANDO, GRAB IT!

LANDO
LOWER IT!

HAN
I'M TRYING!

A MAJOR HIT FROM THE BARGE DECK GUN KNOCKS THE SKIFF ON ITS SIDE. HAN
AND ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE ON BOARD SLIDES OVERBOARD. THE ROPE BREAKS,
AND LANDO FALLS TO THE SIDE OF THE SARLACC PIT. LUCKILY, HAN'S FOOT
CATCHES ON THE SKIFF RAILING AND HE DANGLES ABOVE LANDO AND THE PIT.
THE WOUNDED WOOKIEE HOLDS ONTO THE SKIFF FOR DEAR LIFE AS ANOTHER HIT
FROM THE DECK GUN ROCKS THE SKIFF VIOLENTLY.

HAN
WHOA! WHOA! GRAB ME, CHEWIE! I'M SLIPPING.

CHEWIE GRABS HOLD OF HAN'S FEET, HOLDING HIM UPSIDE DOWN, AS HAN
EXTENDS THE SPEAR TOWARD LANDO, WHO IS CLUTCHING TO THE SIDE OF THE
PIT.

HAN
GRAB IT! L--LANDO. GRAB!

LUKE FINISHES OFF THE LAST GUARD ON THE SECOND SKIFF. HE SEES THE DECK
GUN BLASTING AWAY AT HIS HELPLESS COMPANIONS. LUKE LEAPS FROM THE
SKIFF, ACROSS A CHASM OF AIR, TO THE SHEER METALLIC SIDE OF THE SAIL
BARGE. BARELY ABLE TO GET A FINGERHOLD, HE BEGINS A PAINFUL CLIMB UP
THE HULL, WHEN SUDDENLY AN AX SMASHES THROUGH A WINDOW AN INCH FROM HIS
HEAD. WITH JEDI AGILITY, LUKE GRASPS THE WRIST HOLDING THE AX AND YANKS
THE HELPLESS GUARD THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW AND INTO THE DEADLY PIT.

THE INJURED CHEWIE IS REACHING OVER THE RAIL FOR THE DANGLING HAN, WHO
IS IN TURN BLINDLY REACHING DOWN TOWARD THE DESPERATE LANDO. THE BARON
HAS STOPPED HIS SLIPPAGE DOWN THE SANDY SLOPE OF THE SARLACC PIT BY
LYING VERY STILL. EVERY TIME HE TRIES TO REACH FOR HAN, THE LOOSE SAND
MOVES HIM CLOSER TO HIS FINAL REWARD.

HAN
GRAB IT! ALMOST... YOU ALMOST GOT IT!

ANOTHER BLAST HITS THE FRONT OF THE TILTED SKIFF, CAUSING LANDO TO LET
GO OF THE SPEAR.

LANDO
HOLD IT! WHOA!

AGAIN HAN EXTENDS THE SPEAR TOWARD LANDO.

HAN
GENTLY NOW. ALL... ALL RIGHT. NOW EASY, EASY. HOLD ME, CHEWIE.

LANDO SCREAMS. ONE OF THE SARLACC'S TENTACLES HAS WRAPPED TIGHTLY
AROUND HIS ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN THE SIDE OF THE PIT.

HAN
CHEWIE! CHEWIE, GIVE ME THE GUN. DON'T MOVE, LANDO.

LANDO
NO, WAIT! I THOUGHT YOU WERE BLIND!

HAN
IT'S ALL RIGHT. TRUST ME. DON'T MOVE.

LANDO
ALL RIGHT! A LITTLE HIGHER! JUST A LITTLE HIGHER!

HAN ADJUSTS HIS AIM AS LANDO LOWERS HIS HEAD, AND THE FUZZY-EYED PIRATE
FIRES AT THE TENTACLE. DIRECT HIT. THE TENTACLE RELEASES LANDO, AND
CHEWIE STARTS TO PULL THEM ON BOARD THE SKIFF.

HAN
CHEWIE, PULL US UP! COME ON! OKAY... UP, CHEWIE, UP!

38   EXT UPPER DECK

THE DECK GUNNERS HAVE CHEWIE AND THE DESPERATE DANGLING HUMAN CHAIN IN
THEIR GUN SIGHTS WHEN SOMETHING UP ON DECK COMMANDS THEIR ATTENTION:
LUKE, STANDING BEFORE THEM LIKE A PIRATE KING, IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER.
THE DECK GUNNERS HAVE BARELY REACHED FOR THEIR PISTOLS BEFORE THE YOUNG
JEDI HAS DEMOLISHED THEM. IMMEDIATELY, LUKE TURNS TO SEE TWO MORE
GUNNERS (WHO HAVE BEEN UNCOVERING A GIANT GUN AT THE END OF THE BARGE)
RACING FOR HIM, FIRING THEIR LASER PISTOLS.

39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK

LEIA IS STRUGGLING AGAINST HER CHAINS IN DESPERATION AS ARTOO ZIPS
THROUGH THE TUMULT OF CONFUSED MONSTERS TO THE RESCUE; THE STUBBY
LITTLE DROID EXTENDS A SMALL LASER GUN AND BLASTS THE CHAIN APART.

LEIA
COME ON. WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE QUICK.

ARTOO AND LEIA RACE FOR THE EXIT, PASSING THREEPIO, WHO IS KICKING AND
SCREAMING AS SALACIOUS CRUMB, THE REPTILIAN MONKEY- MONSTER PICKS OUT
ONE OF THE GOLDEN DROID'S EYES.

THREEPIO
NOT MY EYES! ARTOO, HELP! QUICKLY, ARTOO. OH! OHHH! YOU BEAST!

ARTOO ZIPS OVER AND ZAPS SALACIOUS, SENDING HIM SKYWARD WITH A SCREAM,
CRASHING INTO THE RAFTERS AS ARTOO, LEIA, AND THREEPIO (WITH HIS EYE
DANGLING FROM A WIRE) HURRY OFF.

40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

LUKE IS WARDING OFF LASER BLASTS WITH HIS LIGHTSABER, SURROUNDED BY
GUARDS AND FIGHTING LIKE A DEMON. LEIA EMERGES ONTO THE DECK AS LUKE
TURNS TO FACE ANOTHER GUARD.

LUKE	 (TO LEIA)
GET THE GUN! POINT IT AT THE DECK!

LEIA TURNS TOWARD THE BARGE CANNON, CLIMBS ON THE PLATFORM, AND SWIVELS
THE GUN AROUND.

LUKE
POINT IT AT THE DECK!

A LASER BLAST HITS LUKE'S MECHANICAL HAND AND HE BENDS OVER IN PAIN,
BUT MANAGES TO SWING HIS LIGHTSABER UPWARD AND TAKE OUT THE LAST OF THE
GUARDS. HE LOOKS AT THE WOUNDED HAND, WHICH REVEALS THE MECHANISM. HE
FLEXES THE HAND; IT STILL WORKS.

NEAR THE RAIL OF THE UPPER DECK, ARTOO AND THREEPIO STEADY THEMSELVES
AS THREEPIO GETS READY TO JUMP. ARTOO BEEPS WILDLY.

THREEPIO
ARTOO, WHERE ARE WE GOING? I COULDN'T POSSIBLY JUMP.

ARTOO BUTTS THE GOLDEN DROID OVER THE EDGE AND STEPS OFF HIMSELF,
TUMBLING TOWARD THE SAND.

LUKE RUNS ALONG THE EMPTY DECK TOWARD LEIA AND THE BARGE GUN, WHICH SHE
HAS BROUGHT AROUND TO POINT DOWN AT THE DECK.

LUKE
COME ON!

LUKE HAS HOLD ON ONE OF THE RIGGING ROPES FROM THE MAST. HE GATHERS
LEIA IN HIS OTHER ARM AND KICKS THE TRIGGER OF THE DECK GUN. THE GUN
EXPLODES INTO THE DECK AS LUKE AND LEIA SWING OUT TOWARD THE SKIFF.

41   EXT SKIFF

HAN LEANS PANTING AGAINST THE RAIL AS CHEWIE HELPS LANDO ONTO THE DECK.
LUKE AND LEIA LAND ON THE SKIFF WITH FLAIR.

LUKE
LET'S GO! AND DON'T FORGET THE DROIDS.

LANDO
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

THE SAIL BARGE IS EXPLODING IN STAGES IN THE DISTANCE. HALF OF THE HUGE
CRAFT IS ON FIRE.

42   EXT SAND DUNE

THREEPIO'S LEGS STICK STRAIGHT UP FROM THE DUNE WHERE HE LANDED. NEXT
TO IT, ARTOO'S PERISCOPE IS THE ONLY THING ABOVE THE SAND. THE SKIFF
FLOATS ABOVE THEM AND TWO LARGE ELECTROMAGNETS DANGLE DOWN ON A WIRE.
WITH A LOUD CLANG, BOTH DROIDS ARE PULLED
FROM THE SAND.

43   EXT DUNE SEA

THE LITTLE SKIFF SKIPS AROUND THE BURNING SAIL BARGE, WHICH CONTINUES
ITS CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. AS THE SKIFF SAILS OFF ACROSS THE DESERT, THE
BARGE SETTLES TO THE SAND AND DISAPPEARS IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION.

44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA

A FEROCIOUS SANDSTORM BLOCKS OUR VIEW. THEN, THROUGH THE ROAR, WE HEAR
THE VOICES OF OUR HEROES. THEY EMERGE SLOWLY FROM THE VEIL OF SAND,
PRESSING ON AGAINST THE WIND. FIRST COME ARTOO AND THREEPIO, FOLLOWED
BY LEIA GUIDING HAN, THEN LUKE AND LANDO COME INTO VIEW, EACH
SUPPORTING ONE SIDE OF THE TOWERING CHEWBACCA, WHO HOBBLES FROM HIS
WOUND.

SOON, THEY CAN MAKE OUT SOME LARGE VAGUE SHAPES IN THE BLOWING SAND. IT
IS THE MILLENNIUM FALCON AND, PARKED BESIDE IT, LUKE'S TRUSTY X-WING
AND A TWO-SEATED Y-WING. THEY MUST SHOUT TO BE HEARD.

HAN
I DON'T KNOW. ALL I CAN SEE IS A LOT OF BLOWING SAND!

LEIA
THAT'S ALL ANY OF US CAN SEE.

HAN	 (BLINKING)
THEN I GUESS I'M GETTING BETTER.

AS SOON AS THE GROUP HUDDLES UNDER THE BULK OF THE FALCON, THE WIND
DIES DOWN TO SOMETHING MORE DESCRIBABLE AS A SEVERE WEATHER CONDITION.
THREEPIO HITS A SWITCH, AND THE GANG-PLANK LOWERS WITH A HUM.

HAN 	(TURNING TO LUKE)
I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU, KID, YOU WERE PRETTY GOOD OUT THERE.

LUKE	 (SHRUGGING IT OFF)
I HAD A LOT OF HELP. THINK NOTHING OF IT.

HAN
NO, I'M THINKING A LOT ABOUT IT. THAT CARBON FREEZE WAS THE CLOSEST
THING TO DEAD THERE IS. AND IT WASN'T JUST SLEEPIN'. IT WAS A BIG WIDE
AWAKE NOTHING!

LUKE NODS, AS CHEWIE GROWLS AFFECTIONATELY AT THE YOUNG JEDI WARRIOR,
MUSSING HIS HAIR LIKE A PROUD UNCLE. AND LEIA WARMLY HUGS HIM.

LUKE 	(MOVING TO HIS SHIP)
I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT THE FLEET.

HAN
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE THAT CRATE AND COME WITH US?

LUKE
I HAVE A PROMISE I HAVE TO KEEP FIRST... TO AN OLD FRIEND.

LUKE AND ARTOO TAKE OFF IN THEIR SPACECRAFT.

HAN
(LOOKING DUBIOUSLY AT LANDO, OBVIOUSLY REMEMBERING HIS FRIEND'S
BETRAYAL AND SUBSEQUENT AIDE)
GUESS I OWE YOU SOME THANKS, TOO, LANDO.

LANDO
FIGURED IF I LEFT YOU FROZEN LIKE THAT YOU'D JUST GIVE ME BAD LUCK THE
REST OF MY LIFE, SO I MIGHT AS WELL GET YOU UNFROZEN SOONER OR LATER.

LEIA
HE MEANS "YOU'RE WELCOME."

LANDO
COME ON, LET'S GET OFF THIS MISERABLE DUST BALL.

44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE

THE DESOLATE YELLOW PLANET FILLS THE SCREEN, LUKE'S X-WING APPEARS AND
PEELS OFF TO THE LEFT. A MOMENT LATER, THE FALCON APPEARS AS A DOT AND
GROWS HUGE, TO ROAR DIRECTLY OVER THE CAMERA.

45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT

LUKE IS AT THE CONTROLS, WITH ARTOO ATTACHED BEHIND HIM OUTSIDE THE
CANOPY. LUKE SPEAKS INTO HIS COMLINK TO THE OTHERS, IN THE MILLENNIUM
FALCON.

LUKE
I'LL MEET YOU BACK AT THE FLEET.

LEIA	 (OVER COMLINK)
HURRY. THE ALLIANCE SHOULD BE ASSEMBLED BY NOW.

LUKE
I WILL.

HAN	 (OVER COMLINK)
HEY, LUKE, THANKS. THANKS FOR COMIN' AFTER ME. NOW I OWE YOU ONE.

A MESSAGE FROM ARTOO APPEARS ON THE SMALL MONITOR SCREEN IN FRONT OF
LUKE. HE SMILES AT THE MONITOR AND SPEAKS TO ARTOO, AS HE PULLS A BLACK
GLOVE ON TO COVER HIS WOUNDED MECHANICAL HAND.

LUKE
THAT'S RIGHT, ARTOO. WE'RE GOING TO THE DAGOBAH SYSTEM. I HAVE A
PROMISE TO KEEP... TO AN OLD FRIEND.

46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR

A SUPER STAR DESTROYER AND SEVERAL SHIPS OF THE IMPERIAL FLEET REST IN
SPACE ABOVE THE HALF-COMPLETED DEATH STAR AND ITS GREEN NEIGHBOR,
ENDOR. FOUR SQUADS OF TIE FIGHTERS ESCORT AN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE TOWARD
THE DEATH STAR.

47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY

LORD VADER STRIDES DOWN THE HALLWAY, ACCOMPANIED BY A VERY NERVOUS
DEATH STAR COMMANDER.

48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR

THOUSANDS OF IMPERIAL TROOPS IN TIGHT FORMATION FILL THE MAMMOTH
DOCKING BAY. VADER AND THE OFFICER WALK TO THE LANDING PLATFORM, WHERE
THE SHUTTLE IS COMING TO REST.

THE SHUTTLE'S RAMP LOWERS AND THE EMPEROR'S ROYAL GUARDS COME OUT AND
CREATE A LETHAL PERIMETER. THE ASSEMBLED TROOPS MOVE TO RIGID ATTENTION
WITH A MOMENTOUS SNAP.

THEN, IN THE HUGE SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWS, THE EMPEROR APPEARS. HE IS A
RATHER SMALL, SHRIVELED OLD MAN. HIS BENT FRAME SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY
DOWN THE RAMP WITH THE AID OF A GNARLED CANE. HE WEARS A HOODED CLOAK
SIMILAR TO THE ONE BEN WEARS, EXCEPT THAT IT IS BLACK. THE EMPEROR'S
FACE IS SHROUDED AND DIFFICULT TO SEE, EXCEPT FOR HIS PIERCING YELLOW
EYES. COMMANDER JERJERROD AND DARTH VADER KNEEL TO HIM. THE SUPREME
RULER OF THE GALAXY BECKONS TO THE DARK LORD.

EMPEROR	 (TO VADER)
RISE, MY FRIEND.

VADER RISES AND FALLS IN NEXT TO THE EMPEROR AS HE SLOWLY MAKES HIS WAY
ALONG THE ROWS OF TROOPS. JERJERROD AND THE OTHER COMMANDERS STAY
KNEELING UNTIL THE SUPREME RULER AND VADER, FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL
IMPERIAL DIGNITARIES, PASS BY; ONLY THEN DO THEY JOIN IN THE
PROCESSION.

VADER
THE DEATH STAR WILL BE COMPLETED ON SCHEDULE.

EMPEROR
YOU HAVE DONE WELL, LORD VADER. AND NOW I SENSE YOU WISH TO CONTINUE
YOUR SEARCH FOR YOUNG SKYWALKER.

VADER
YES, MY MASTER.

EMPEROR
PATIENCE, MY FRIEND. IN TIME HE WILL SEEK YOU OUT. AND WHEN HE DOES,
YOU MUST BRING HIM
BEFORE ME. HE HAS GROWN STRONG. ONLY TOGETHER CAN WE TURN HIM TO THE
DARK SIDE OF THE
FORCE.

VADER
AS YOU WISH.

EMPEROR
EVERYTHING IS PROCEEDING AS I HAVE FORESEEN.

HE LAUGHS TO HIMSELF AS THEY PASS ALONG THE VAST LINE OF IMPERIAL
TROOPS.

49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH

ONCE AGAIN, ARTOO FINDS HIMSELF WAITING AROUND IN THE DAMP ENVIRONS OF
THE SWAMP PLANET, AND HE'S NONE TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT. HE BEEPS
DISCONSOLATELY TO HIMSELF AND TURNS TO LOOK AT YODA'S COTTAGE. WARM
YELLOW LIGHT ESCAPES THE ODDLY SHAPED WINDOWS TO FIGHT THE GLOOM.

50   INT YODA'S HOUSE

THE TIP OF A WALKING STICK TAPS HESITANTLY ACROSS THE EARTHEN FLOOR OF
THE COTTAGE. OUR VIEW TRAVELS UP THE STICK TO THE SMALL GREEN HAND THAT
CLUTCHES IT, AND THEN TO THE FAMILIAR FACE OF YODA, THE JEDI MASTER.
HIS MANNER IS FRAIL, AND HIS VOICE, THOUGH CHEERFUL, SEEMS WEAKER.

YODA
HMM. THAT FACE YOU MAKE. LOOK I SO OLD TO YOUNG EYES?

LUKE IS SITTING IN A CORNER OF THE CRAMPED SPACE AND, INDEED, HIS LOOK
HAS BEEN WOEFUL. CAUGHT, HE TRIES TO HIDE IT.

LUKE
NO... OF COURSE NOT.

YODA	 (TICKLED, CHUCKLES)
I DO, YES, I DO!  SICK HAVE I BECOME. OLD AND WEAK.
(POINTS A CROOKED FINGER)
WHEN NINE HUNDRED YEARS OLD YOU REACH, LOOK AS GOOD YOU WILL NOT. HMM?

YODA CHUCKLES AT THIS, COUGHS, AND HOBBLES OVER TOWARD HIS BED.

YODA
SOON WILL I REST. YES, FOREVER SLEEP. EARNED IT, I HAVE.

YODA SITS HIMSELF ON HIS BED, WITH GREAT EFFORT.

LUKE
MASTER YODA, YOU CAN'T DIE.

YODA
STRONG AM I WITH THE FORCE... BUT NOT THAT STRONG! TWILIGHT IS UPON ME
AND SOON NIGHT MUST FALL. THAT IS THE WAY OF THINGS... THE WAY OF THE
FORCE.

LUKE
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP. I'VE COME BACK TO COMPLETE THE TRAINING.

YODA
NO MORE TRAINING DO YOU REQUIRE. ALREADY KNOW YOU THAT WHICH YOU NEED.

YODA SIGHS, AND LIES BACK ON HIS BED.

LUKE
THEN I AM A JEDI?

YODA	 (SHAKES HIS HEAD)
OHHH. NOT YET. ONE THING REMAINS: VADER. YOU MUST CONFRONT VADER. THEN,
ONLY THEN, A JEDI WILL YOU BE. AND CONFRONT HIM YOU WILL.

LUKE IS IN AGONY. HE IS SILENT FOR A LONG MOMENT, SCREWING UP HIS
COURAGE. FINALLY HE IS ABLE TO ASK.

LUKE
MASTER YODA... IS DARTH VADER MY FATHER?

YODA'S EYES ARE FULL OF WEARINESS AND COMPASSION. AN ODD, SAD SMILE
CREASES HIS FACE. HE TURNS PAINFULLY ON HIS SIDE, AWAY FROM LUKE.

YODA
MMM... REST I NEED. YES... REST.

LUKE WATCHES HIM, EACH MOMENT AN ETERNITY.

LUKE
YODA, I MUST KNOW.

YODA
YOUR FATHER HE IS.

LUKE REACTS AS IF CUT.

YODA
TOLD YOU, DID HE?

LUKE
YES.

A NEW LOOK OF CONCERN CROSSES YODA'S FACE.  HE CLOSES HIS EYES.

YODA
UNEXPECTED THIS IS, AND UNFORTUNATE...

LUKE
UNFORTUNATE THAT I KNOW THE TRUTH?

YODA OPENS HIS EYES AGAIN AND STUDIES THE YOUTH.

YODA		 (GATHERING ALL HIS STRENGTH)
NO. UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU RUSHED TO FACE HIM... THAT INCOMPLETE WAS YOUR
TRAINING. NOT
READY FOR THE BURDEN WERE YOU.

LUKE
WELL, I'M SORRY.

YODA
REMEMBER, A JEDI'S STRENGTH FLOWS FROM THE FORCE.  BUT BEWARE.  ANGER,
FEAR, AGGRESSION.
THE DARK SIDE ARE THEY.  ONCE YOU START DOWN THE DARK PATH, FOREVER
WILL IT DOMINATE YOUR
DESTINY.

HE BECKONS THE YOUNG JEDI CLOSER TO HIM.

YODA
LUKE...LUKE...DO NOT...DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWERS OF THE EMPEROR,
OR SUFFER YOUR FATHER'S FATE, YOU WILL. LUKE, WHEN GONE AM I
(COUGH),
THE LAST OF THE JEDI WILL YOU BE. LUKE, THE FORCE RUNS STRONG IN YOUR
FAMILY. PASS ON WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED, LUKE...
(WITH GREAT EFFORT)
THERE IS...ANOTHER...SKY...SKY...WALKER.

HE CATCHES HIS BREATH. A SHIVER RUNS THROUGH THE ANCIENT GREEN
CREATURE, AND HE DIES. LUKE STARES AT HIS DEAD MASTER AS HE DISAPPEARS
IN FRONT OF HIS EYES.

51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING

LUKE WANDERS BACK TO WHERE HIS SHIP IS SITTING. ARTOO BEEPS A GREETING,
BUT IS IGNORED BY HIS DEPRESSED MASTER. LUKE KNEELS DOWN, BEGINS TO
HELP ARTOO WITH THE SHIP, THEN STOPS AND SHAKES HIS HEAD DEJECTEDLY.

LUKE
I CAN'T DO IT, ARTOO. I CAN'T GO ON ALONE.

BEN	 (OS)
YODA WILL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

LUKE LOOKS UP TO SEE THE SHIMMERING IMAGE OF BEN KENOBI.

LUKE
OBI-WAN! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

THE GHOST OF BEN KENOBI APPROACHES HIM THROUGH THE SWAMP.

LUKE
YOU TOLD ME VADER BETRAYED AND MURDERED MY FATHER.

BEN
YOU FATHER WAS SEDUCED BY THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE. HE CEASED TO BE
ANAKIN SKYWALKER
AND BECAME DARTH VADER. WHEN THAT HAPPENED, THE GOOD MAN WHO WAS YOUR
FATHER WAS DESTROYED. SO WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU WAS TRUE... FROM A
CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW.

LUKE	 (TURNING AWAY, DERISIVE)
A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW!

BEN
LUKE, YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT MANY OF THE TRUTHS WE CLING TO DEPEND
GREATLY ON OUR OWN
POINT OF VIEW.

LUKE IS UNRESPONSIVE. BEN STUDIES HIM IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT.

BEN
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR BEING ANGRY. IF I WAS WRONG IN WHAT I DID, IT
CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU SEE, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FATHER WAS MY FAULT.

BEN PAUSES SADLY.

BEN
ANAKIN WAS A GOOD FRIEND.

LUKE TURNS WITH INTEREST AT THIS. AS BEN SPEAKS, LUKE SETTLES ON A
STUMP, MESMERIZED. ARTOO COMES OVER TO OFFER HIS COMFORTING PRESENCE.

BEN
WHEN I FIRST KNEW HIM, YOUR FATHER WAS ALREADY A GREAT PILOT. BUT I WAS
AMAZED HOW STRONGLY THE FORCE WAS WITH HIM. I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO
TRAIN HIM AS A JEDI. I THOUGHT THAT I COULD INSTRUCT HIM JUST AS WELL
AS YODA. I WAS WRONG. MY PRIDE HAS HAD TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE
GALAXY.

LUKE IS ENTRANCED.

LUKE
THERE'S STILL GOOD IN HIM.

BEN
I ALSO THOUGHT HE COULD BE TURNED BACK TO THE GOOD SIDE. IT COULDN'T BE
DONE. HE IS MORE MACHINE NOW THAN MAN. TWISTED AND EVIL.

LUKE
I CAN'T DO IT, BEN.

BEN
YOU CANNOT ESCAPE YOUR DESTINY.

LUKE
I TRIED TO STOP HIM ONCE. I COULDN'T DO IT.

BEN
VADER HUMBLED YOU WHEN FIRST YOU MET HIM, LUKE... BUT THAT EXPERIENCE
WAS PART OF YOUR TRAINING. IT TAUGHT YOU, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE VALUE
OF PATIENCE. HAD YOU NOT BEEN SO IMPATIENT TO DEFEAT VADER THEN, YOU
COULD HAVE FINISHED YOUR TRAINING HERE WITH YODA. YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
PREPARED.

LUKE
BUT I HAD TO HELP MY FRIENDS.

BEN	 (GRINNING AT LUKE'S INDIGNATION)
AND DID YOU HELP THEM? IT WAS THEY WHO HAD TO SAVE YOU. YOU ACHIEVED
LITTLE BY RUSHING BACK PREMATURELY, I FEAR.

LUKE	 (WITH SADNESS)
I FOUND OUT DARTH VADER WAS MY FATHER.

BEN
TO BE A JEDI, LUKE, YOU MUST CONFRONT AND THEN GO BEYOND THE DARK SIDE
- THE SIDE YOUR FATHER COULDN'T GET PAST. IMPATIENCE IS THE EASIEST
DOOR - FOR YOU, LIKE YOUR FATHER. ONLY, YOUR FATHER WAS SEDUCED BY WHAT
HE FOUND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, AND YOU HAVE HELD FIRM. YOU'RE
NO LONGER SO RECKLESS NOW, LUKE. YOU ARE STRONG AND PATIENT. AND NOW,
YOU MUST FACE DARTH VADER AGAIN!

LUKE
I CAN'T KILL MY OWN FATHER.

BEN
THEN THE EMPEROR HAS ALREADY WON. YOU WERE OUR ONLY HOPE.

LUKE
YODA SPOKE OF ANOTHER.

BEN
THE OTHER HE SPOKE OF IS YOUR TWIN SISTER.

LUKE
BUT I HAVE NO SISTER.

BEN
HMM. TO PROTECT YOU BOTH FROM THE EMPEROR, YOU WERE HIDDEN FROM YOUR
FATHER WHEN YOU WERE BORN. THE EMPEROR KNEW, AS I DID, IF ANAKIN WERE
TO HAVE ANY OFFSPRING, THEY WOULD BE A THREAT TO HIM. THAT IS THE
REASON WHY YOUR SISTER REMAINS SAFELY ANONYMOUS.

LUKE
LEIA! LEIA'S MY SISTER.

BEN
YOUR INSIGHT SERVES YOU WELL. BURY YOUR FEELINGS DEEP DOWN, LUKE. THEY
DO YOU CREDIT.
BUT THEY COULD BE MADE TO SERVE THE EMPEROR.

LUKE LOOKS INTO THE DISTANCE, TRYING TO COMPREHEND ALL THIS.

BEN	 (CONTINUING HIS NARRATIVE)
WHEN YOUR FATHER LEFT, HE DIDN'T KNOW YOUR MOTHER WAS PREGNANT. YOUR
MOTHER AND I KNEW HE WOULD FIND OUT EVENTUALLY, BUT WE WANTED TO KEEP
YOU BOTH AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE, FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.  SO I TOOK YOU
TO LIVE WITH MY BROTHER OWEN ON TATOOINE... AND YOUR MOTHER TOOK LEIA
TO LIVE AS THE DAUGHTER OF SENATOR ORGANA, ON ALDERAAN.

LUKE TURNS, AND SETTLES NEAR BEN TO HEAR THE TALE.

BEN	 (ATTEMPTING TO GIVE SOLACE WITH HIS WORDS)
THE ORGANA HOUSEHOLD WAS HIGH-BORN AND POLITICALLY QUITE POWERFUL IN
THAT SYSTEM. LEIA BECAME A PRINCESS BY VIRTUE OF LINEAGE... NO ONE KNEW
SHE'D BEEN ADOPTED, OF COURSE. BUT IT WAS A TITLE WITHOUT REAL POWER,
SINCE ALDERAAN HAD LONG BEEN A DEMOCRACY.  EVEN SO, THE FAMILY
CONTINUED TO BE POLITICALLY POWERFUL, AND LEIA, FOLLOWING IN HER FOSTER
FATHER'S PATH, BECAME A SENATOR AS WELL.  THAT'S NOT ALL SHE BECAME, OF
COURSE... SHE BECAME THE LEADER OF HER CELL IN THE ALLIANCE AGAINST THE
CORRUPT EMPIRE. AND BECAUSE SHE HAD DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY, SHE WAS A
VITAL LINK FOR GETTING INFORMATION TO THE REBEL CAUSE.  THAT'S WHAT SHE
WAS DOING WHEN HER PATH CROSSED YOURS... FOR HER FOSTER PARENTS HAD
ALWAYS TOLD HER TO CONTACT ME ON TATOOINE, IF HER TROUBLES BECAME
DESPERATE.

LUKE IS OVERWHELMED BY THE TRUTH, AND IS SUDDENLY PROTECTIVE OF HIS
SISTER.

LUKE
BUT YOU CAN'T LET HER GET INVOLVED NOW, BEN. VADER WILL DESTROY HER.

BEN
SHE HASN'T BEEN TRAINED IN THE WAYS OF THE JEDI THE WAY YOU HAVE,
LUKE... BUT THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH HER, AS IT IS WITH ALL OF YOUR
FAMILY. THERE IS NO AVOIDING THE BATTLE. YOU MUST FACE AND DESTROY
VADER!

52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

THE VAST REBEL FLEET STRETCHES AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. OVERHEAD A
DOZEN SMALL CORELLIAN BATTLESHIPS FLY IN FORMATION. FIGHTERS AND
BATTLECRUISERS SURROUND THE LARGEST OF THE REBEL STAR CRUISERS, THE
HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.

53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM

HUNDREDS OF REBEL COMMANDERS OF ALL RACES AND FORMS ARE ASSEMBLED IN
THE WAR ROOM. WEDGE IS AMONG THEM. IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM IS A
HOLOGRAPHIC MODEL DEPICTING THE HALF-COMPLETED IMPERIAL DEATH STAR, THE
NEARBY MOON OF ENDOR, AND THE PROTECTING DEFLECTOR SHIELD.

MON MOTHMA, THE LEADER OF THE ALLIANCE, ENTERS THE ROOM. SHE IS A STERN
BUT BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN HER FIFTIES. CONFERRING WITH HER ARE SEVERAL
MILITARY LEADERS, INCLUDING GENERAL MADINE AND ADMIRAL ACKBAR (A
SALMON-COLORED MON CALAMARI). LANDO MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD UNTIL HE
FINDS HAN AND CHEWIE, STANDING NEXT TO LEIA AND THE TWO DROIDS.

HAN PEERS AT LANDO'S NEW INSIGNIA ON HIS CHEST, AND IS AMUSED.

HAN
WELL, LOOK AT YOU, A GENERAL, HUH?

 LANDO
 OH, WELL, SOMEONE MUST HAVE TOLD THEM ABOUT MY LITTLE MANEUVER AT THE
BATTLE OF TAANAB.

HAN	 (SARCASTIC)
WELL, DON'T LOOK AT ME, PAL. I JUST SAID YOU WERE A FAIR PILOT. I
DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE
LOOKIN' FOR SOMEBODY TO LEAD THIS CRAZY ATTACK.

LANDO	 (SMILING)
I'M SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T ASK YOU TO DO IT.

HAN
WELL, WHO SAYS THEY DIDN'T.  BUT I AIN'T CRAZY. YOU'RE THE RESPECTABLE
ONE, REMEMBER?

MON MOTHMA SIGNALS FOR ATTENTION, AND THE ROOM FALLS SILENT.

MON MOTHMA
THE EMPEROR HAS MADE A CRITICAL ERROR AND THE TIME FOR OUR ATTACK HAS
COME.

THIS CAUSES A STIR. MON MOTHMA TURNS TO A HOLOGRAPHIC MODEL OF THE
DEATH STAR, THE ENDOR MOON AND THE PROTECTING DEFLECTOR SHIELD IN THE
CENTER OF THE ROOM.

MON MOTHMA
THE DATA BROUGHT TO US BY THE BOTHAN SPIES PINPOINTS THE EXACT LOCATION
OF THE EMPEROR'S NEW BATTLE STATION. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE WEAPON
SYSTEMS OF THIS DEATH STAR ARE NOT YET OPERATIONAL. WITH THE IMPERIAL
FLEET SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE GALAXY IN A VAIN EFFORT TO ENGAGE US, IT IS
RELATIVELY UNPROTECTED. BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, WE'VE LEARNED THAT
THE EMPEROR HIMSELF IS PERSONALLY OVERSEEING THE FINAL STAGES OF THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THIS DEATH STAR.

A VOLLEY OF SPIRITED CHATTER ERUPTS FROM THE CROWD. HAN TURNS TO LEIA
AS CHEWIE BARKS HIS AMAZEMENT.

MON MOTHMA	 (CONT)
MANY BOTHANS DIED TO BRING US THIS INFORMATION. ADMIRAL ACKBAR, PLEASE.

ADMIRAL ACKBAR STEPS FORWARD AND POINTS TO THE DEATH STAR'S FORCE FIELD
AND THE MOON OF ENDOR.

ACKBAR
YOU CAN SEE HERE THE DEATH STAR ORBITING THE FOREST MOON OF ENDOR.
ALTHOUGH THE WEAPON
SYSTEMS ON THIS DEATH STAR ARE NOT YET OPERATIONAL, THE DEATH STAR DOES
HAVE A STRONG DEFENSE MECHANISM. IT IS PROTECTED BY AN ENERGY SHIELD,
WHICH IS GENERATED FROM THE NEARBY FOREST MOON OF ENDOR. THE SHIELD
MUST BE DEACTIVATED IF ANY ATTACK IS TO BE ATTEMPTED. ONCE THE SHIELD
IS DOWN, OUR CRUISERS WILL CREATE A PERIMETER, WHILE THE FIGHTERS FLY
INTO THE SUPERSTRUCTURE AND ATTEMPT TO KNOCK OUT THE MAIN REACTOR.

THERE'S A CONCERNED MURMUR.

ACKBAR	 (CONT)
GENERAL CALRISSIAN HAS VOLUNTEERED TO LEAD THE FIGHTER ATTACK

HAN TURNS TO LANDO WITH A LOOK OF RESPECT.

HAN
GOOD LUCK.

LANDO NODS HIS THANKS.

HAN
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

ACKBAR
GENERAL MADINE.

MADINE MOVES CENTER STAGE.

GENERAL MADINE
WE HAVE STOLEN A SMALL IMPERIAL SHUTTLE. DISGUISED AS A CARGO SHIP, AND
USING A SECRET
IMPERIAL CODE, A STRIKE TEAM WILL LAND ON THE MOON AND DEACTIVATE THE
SHIELD GENERATOR.

THE ASSEMBLY BEGINS TO MUMBLE AMONG THEMSELVES.

THREEPIO
SOUNDS DANGEROUS.

LEIA	 (TO HAN)
I WONDER WHO THEY FOUND TO PULL THAT OFF.

GENERAL MADINE
GENERAL SOLO, IS YOUR STRIKE TEAM ASSEMBLED?

LEIA, STARTLED, LOOKS UP AT HAN, SURPRISE CHANGING TO ADMIRATION.

HAN
UH, MY TEAM'S READY. I DON'T HAVE A COMMAND CREW FOR THE SHUTTLE.

CHEWBACCA RAISES HIS HAIRY PAW AND VOLUNTEERS.  HAN LOOKS UP AT HIM.

HAN
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH, PAL. I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR YOU.

CHEWIE WAVES THAT OFF WITH A HUGE GROWL.

HAN	 (SMILES)
THAT'S ONE.

LEIA
UH, GENERAL... COUNT ME IN.

VOICE	 (OS)
I'M WITH YOU, TOO!

THEY TURN IN THAT DIRECTION AND PEER INTO THE CROWD AS THERE ARE MORE
CHEERS. THE COMMANDERS PART, AND THERE AT THE BACK STANDS LUKE. HAN AND
LEIA ARE SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED.

LEIA MOVES TO LUKE AND EMBRACES HIM WARMLY. SHE SENSES A CHANGE IN HIM
AND LOOKS INTO HIS EYES QUESTIONINGLY.

LEIA
 WHAT IS IT?

LUKE	 (HESITANT)
ASK ME AGAIN SOMETIME.

HAN, CHEWIE, AND LANDO CROWD AROUND LUKE AS THE ASSEMBLY BREAKS UP.

HAN
LUKE.

LUKE
HI, HAN... CHEWIE.

ARTOO BEEPS A SINGSONG OBSERVATION TO A WORRIED THREEPIO.

 THREEPIO
"EXCITING" IS HARDLY THE WORD I WOULD USE.

54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON RESTS BEYOND THE STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, WHICH
LOOKS ANOMALOUS AMONG ALL THE REBEL SHIPS IN THE VAST DOCKING BAY.
CHEWIE BARKS A FINAL FAREWELL TO LANDO AND LEADS ARTOO AND THREEPIO UP
THE SHUTTLE, CROWDED NOW WITH THE REBEL STRIKE TEAM LOADING WEAPONS AND
SUPPLIES. LANDO TURNS TO FACE HAN. LUKE AND LEIA HAVE SAID THEIR GOOD-
BYES AND START UP THE RAMP.

HAN
LOOK. I WANT YOU TO TAKE HER. I MEAN IT. TAKE HER. YOU NEED ALL THE
HELP YOU CAN GET. SHE'S
THE FASTEST SHIP IN THE FLEET.

LANDO
ALL RIGHT, OLD BUDDY. YOU KNOW, I KNOW WHAT SHE MEANS TO YOU. I'LL TAKE
GOOD CARE OF HER.
SHE-SHE WON'T GET A SCRATCH. ALL RIGHT?

HAN	 (LOOKS AT HIM WARMLY)
RIGHT. I GOT YOUR PROMISE NOW. NOT A SCRATCH.

LANDO
LOOK, WOULD YOU GET GOING, YOU PIRATE.

HAN AND LANDO PAUSE, THEN EXCHANGE SALUTES.

LANDO
GOOD LUCK.

HAN
YOU, TOO.

HAN GOES UP THE RAMP. LANDO WATCHES HIM GO AND THEN SLOWLY TURNS AWAY.

55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

LUKE IS WORKING ON A BACK CONTROL PANEL AS HAN COMES IN AND TAKES THE
PILOT'S SEAT. CHEWIE, IN THE SEAT NEXT TO HIM, IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
ALL THE IMPERIAL CONTROLS.

HAN
YOU GOT HER WARMED?

LUKE
YEAH, SHE'S COMIN' UP.

CHEWIE GROWLS A COMPLAINT.

HAN
NO. I DON'T THINK THE EMPIRE HAD WOOKIEES IN MIND WHEN THEY DESIGNED
HER, CHEWIE.

LEIA COMES IN FROM THE HOLD AND TAKES HER SEAT NEAR LUKE.

CHEWIE BARKS AND HITS SOME SWITCHES. HAN'S GLANCE HAS STUCK ON
SOMETHING OUT THE WINDOW: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON. LEIA NUDGES HIM
GENTLY.

LEIA
HEY, ARE YOU AWAKE?

HAN
YEAH, I JUST GOT A FUNNY FEELING. LIKE I'M NOT GONNA SEE HER AGAIN.

CHEWIE, HEARING THIS, STOPS HIS ACTIVITY AND LOOKS LONGINGLY OUT AT THE
FALCON, TOO. LEIA PUTS A HAND ON HAN'S SHOULDER.

LEIA	 (SOFTLY)
COME ON, GENERAL, LET'S MOVE.

HAN SNAPS BACK TO LIFE.

HAN
RIGHT. CHEWIE, LET'S SEE WHAT THIS PIECE OF JUNK CAN DO. READY,
EVERYBODY?

LUKE
ALL SET.

THREEPIO

HAN
ALL RIGHT, HANG ON.

56   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET

OFF INTO SPACE.

57   INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

THE CONVERTED CONTROL ROOM IS DIMLY LIT, EXCEPT FOR A POOL OF LIGHT AT
THE FAR END. THERE THE EMPEROR SITS IN AN ELABORATE CONTROL CHAIR
BEFORE A LARGE WINDOW WHICH LOOKS OUT ACROSS THE HALF-COMPLETED DEATH
STAR TO THE GIANT GREEN MOON OF ENDOR.

DARTH VADER, STANDING WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL,
CAUTIOUSLY APPROACHES HIS MASTER. THE RULER'S BACK IS TO VADER. AFTER
SEVERAL TENSE MOMENTS, THE EMPEROR'S CHAIR ROTATES AROUND TO FACE HIM.

VADER
WHAT IS THY BIDDING, MY MASTER?

EMPEROR
SEND THE FLEET TO THE FAR SIDE OF ENDOR. THERE IT WILL STAY UNTIL
CALLED FOR.

VADER
WHAT OF THE REPORTS OF THE REBEL FLEET MASSING NEAR SULLUST?

EMPEROR
IT IS OF NO CONCERN. SOON THE REBELLION WILL BE CRUSHED AND YOUNG
SKYWALKER WILL BE ONE OF US! YOUR WORK HERE IS FINISHED, MY FRIEND. GO
OUT TO THE COMMAND SHIP AND AWAIT MY ORDERS.

VADER
YES, MY MASTER.

VADER BOWS, THEN TURNS AND EXITS THE THRONE ROOM AS THE EMPEROR WALKS
TOWARD THE WAITING COUNCIL MEMBERS.

58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON

THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF IMPERIAL TRAFFIC IN THE AREA AS CONSTRUCTION

LUKE
VADER'S ON THAT SHIP.

HAN

LUKE
I'M ENDANGERING THE MISSION. I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

ON AN ADJACENT HILL, THE HELMETED REBEL CONTINGENT MAKES ITS WAY UP A
STEEP TRAIL. LEIA AND HAN ARE SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF CHEWIE AND LUKE. THE
TROOPS OF THE STRIKE-TEAM SQUAD FOLLOW, WITH ARTOO AND THREEPIO
BRINGING UP THE REAR. ARTOO BEEPS.

UP AHEAD, CHEWIE AND LEIA REACH A CREST IN THE HILL AND DROP SUDDENLY
TO THE GROUND, SIGNALING THE REST OF THE GROUP TO STOP. HAN AND LUKE
CRAWL UP TO TAKE A LOOK.

THREEPIO
OH, I TOLD YOU IT WAS DANGEROUS HERE.

THROUGH BUSHES IN THE VALLEY BELOW. THEIR TWO ROCKET BIKES ARE PARKED
NEARBY.

LEIA

LEIA MOTIONS FOR THE SQUAD TO STAY PUT, THEN SHE, HAN, LUKE AND CHEWIE
START QUIETLY DOWN.

LUKE AND LEIA EXCHANGE SMILES.

HAN SNEAKS UP BEHIND ONE OF THE SCOUTS, STEPS ON A TWIG AND THE SCOUT
WHIRLS, KNOCKING HAN INTO A TREE. THE SCOUT SHOUTS FOR HIS COMPANION.

SCOUT #1
GO FOR HELP! GO!

THE SECOND SCOUT JUMPS ON HIS SPEEDER BIKE AND TAKES OFF, BUT CHEWIE
GETS OFF A SHOT ON HIS CROSSBOW LASER WEAPON, CAUSING THE SCOUT TO
CRASH INTO A TREE. HAN AND SCOUT #1 ARE IN A ROUSING FISTFIGHT.

DRAWN. AS THEY RUN THROUGH THE BUSHES, LEIA STOPS AND POINTS TO WHERE
TWO MORE SCOUTS ARE SITTING ON THEIR SPEEDER BIKES, WITH AN UNOCCUPIED
BIKE PARKED NEARBY.

LEIA
OVER THERE! TWO MORE OF THEM!

LUKE
I SEE THEM. WAIT, LEIA!

BUT LEIA DOESN'T HEAR HIM AND RACES FOR THE REMAINING SPEEDER BIKE. SHE
STARTS IT UP AND TAKES OFF AS LUKE JUMPS ON THE BIKE BEHIND HER.

QUICK! JAM THEIR COMLINK. CENTER SWITCH!

LUKE AND LEIA SPEED INTO THE DENSE FOLIAGE IN HOT PURSUIT, BARELY
AVOIDING TWO HUGE TREES.

THEIR BIKE'S LASER CANNON HITTING HARMLESSLY NEAR THE MOVING TARGETS.

LUKE
MOVE CLOSER!

LEIA GUNS IT, CLOSING THE GAP, AS THE TWO SCOUTS RECKLESSLY VEER
THROUGH A NARROW GAP IN THE TREES. ONE OF THE BIKES SCRAPES A TREE,
SLOWING THE SCOUT.

LUKE
GET ALONGSIDE THAT ONE!

LEIA PULLS HER SPEEDER BIKE UP SO CLOSE TO THE SCOUT'S BIKE THAT THEIR
STEERING VANES SCRAPE NOISILY. LUKE LEAPS FROM HIS BIKE TO THE BACK OF
THE SCOUT'S, GRABS THE IMPERIAL WARRIOR AROUND THE NECK, AND FLIPS HIM
OFF THE BIKE, INTO A THICK TREE TRUNK. LUKE GAINS CONTROL OF THE BIKE
AND FOLLOWS LEIA, WHO HAS PULLED AHEAD. THEY TEAR OFF AFTER THE
REMAINING SCOUT.

LUKE
GET HIM!

THE SPEEDING CHASE PASSES TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. THESE TWO SWING
INTO PURSUIT, CHASING LUKE AND LEIA, FIRING AWAY WITH THEIR LASER
CANNON. THE TWO REBELS LOOK BEHIND THEM JUST AS LUKE'S BIKE TAKES A
GLANCING HIT.

LUKE	 (INDICATING THE ONE AHEAD)
KEEP ON THAT ONE! I'LL TAKE THESE TWO!

WITH LEIA SHOOTING AHEAD, LUKE SUDDENLY SLAMS HIS STEERING VANES INTO
THE BRAKING MODE. LUKE'S BIKE IS A BLUR TO THE TWO PURSUING SCOUTS AS
THEY ZIP BY HIM ON EITHER SIDE. LUKE SLAMS HIS BIKE INTO FORWARD AND
STARTS FIRING AWAY, HAVING SWITCHED PLACES WITH HIS PURSUERS IN A
MANNER OF SECONDS. LUKE'S AIM IS GOOD AND ONE SCOUT'S BIKE IS BLASTED
OUT OF CONTROL. IT EXPLODES AGAINST A TREE TRUNK.

THE SCOUT'S COHORT TAKES ONE GLANCE BACK AT THE FLASH AND SHIFTS INTO
TURBO DRIVE, GOING EVEN FASTER. LUKE KEEPS ON HIS TAIL.

FAR AHEAD, LEIA AND THE FIRST SCOUT ARE DOING A HIGHSPEED SLALOM
THROUGH THE DEATH-DEALING TRUNKS. NOW LEIA AIMS HER BIKE SKYWARD AND
RISES OUT OF SIGHT.

THE SCOUT TURNS IN CONFUSION, UNABLE TO SEE HIS PURSUER. SUDDENLY, LEIA
DIVES DOWN UPON HIM FROM ABOVE, CANNON BLASTING. THE SCOUT'S BIKE TAKES
A GLANCING HIT.

LEIA MOVES IN ALONGSIDE HIM. THE SCOUT EYES HER BESIDE HIM, REACHES
DOWN, AND PULLS OUT A HANDGUN. BEFORE LEIA CAN REACT, THE SCOUT HAS
BLASTED HER BIKE, SENDING IT OUT OF CONTROL. LEIA DIVES OFF AS HER BIKE
EXPLODES AGAINST A TREE. THE HAPPY SCOUT LOOKS BACK AT THE EXPLOSION.
BUT WHEN HE TURNS FORWARD AGAIN, HE IS ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH A
GIANT FALLEN TREE. HE HITS HIS BRAKES TO NO AVAIL AND DISAPPEARS IN A
CONFLAGRATION.

ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: LUKE AND THE LAST REMAINING SCOUT CONTINUE
THEIR WEAVING CHASE THROUGH THE TREES. NOW LUKE MOVES UP CLOSE. THE
SCOUT RESPONDS BY SLAMMING HIS BIKE INTO LUKE'S. A FALLEN TREE FORMS A
BRIDGE ACROSS THEIR PATH. THE SCOUT ZIPS UNDER. LUKE GOES OVER THE TOP
AND CRASHES HIS BIKE DOWN ON THE SCOUT'S. BOTH RIDERS LOOK AHEAD - A
WIDE TRUNK LOOMS DIRECTLY IN LUKE'S PATH, BUT THE SCOUT'S BIKE BESIDE
HIM MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO AVOID IT. LUKE BANKS WITH ALL
HIS MIGHT, LEANING ALMOST HORIZONTAL OVER THE SCOUT'S BIKE, AND IS ABLE
TO MAKE IT BY, JUST CLIPPING THE TREE. WHEN HE STRAIGHTENS, HE AND THE
SCOUT DISCOVER THAT THEIR TWO BIKES HAVE LOCKED FRONT VANES AND ARE
MOVING AS ONE.

ANOTHER BIG TREE LOOMS IN LUKE'S PATH. HE REACTS INSTINCTIVELY AND
DIVES OFF HIS BIKE. THE TWO BIKES COME APART A SECOND BEFORE LUKE'S
EXPLODES AGAINST A TREE. THE SCOUT SWEEPS OUT AND CIRCLES BACK TO FIND
LUKE.

LUKE RISES FROM THE UNDERGROWTH AS THE SCOUT BEARS DOWN ON HIM AND
OPENS FIRE WITH HIS LASER CANNON. LUKE IGNITES HIS LASER SWORD AND
BEGINS DEFLECTING THE BOLTS. THE SCOUT'S BIKE KEEPS COMING AND IT
APPEARS THAT IN A SECOND IT WILL CUT LUKE IN HALF. AT THE LAST INSTANT,
LUKE STEPS ASIDE AND CHOPS OFF THE BIKE'S CONTROL VANES WITH ONE MIGHTY
SLASH. THE SCOUT'S BIKE BEGINS TO SHUDDER, THEN, PITCHING AND ROLLING,
IT RISES UP TO SLAM DIRECTLY INTO A TREE IN A GIANT BALL OF FIRE.

66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST

HAN, CHEWIE, AND THE DROIDS, ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE SQUAD, WAIT
ANXIOUSLY IN THE CLEARING. ARTOO'S RADAR SCREEN STICKS OUT OF HIS DOMED
HEAD AND REVOLVES, SCANNING THE FOREST. HE BEEPS.

THREEPIO
OH, GENERAL SOLO, SOMEBODY'S COMING. OH!

HAN, CHEWIE, AND THE REST OF THE SQUAD RAISE THEIR WEAPONS.

LUKE STEPS OUT OF THE FOLIAGE TO FIND THE WEAPONS TRAINED ON HIM. HE'S
TOO TIRED TO CARE. HE PLOPS HIMSELF DOWN ON A BOULDER AND LOOKS AROUND.

HAN
LUKE! WHERE'S LEIA?

LUKE	 (CONCERNED)
WHAT? SHE DIDN'T COME BACK?

HAN
I THOUGHT SHE WAS WITH YOU.

LUKE
WE GOT SEPARATED.

LUKE AND HAN EXCHANGE A SILENT, GRIM LOOK. LUKE GETS UP WEARILY.

LUKE
HEY, WE BETTER GO LOOK FOR HER.

HAN NODS, AND SIGNALS TO A REBEL OFFICER.

HAN
TAKE THE SQUAD AHEAD.  WE'LL MEET AT THE SHIELD GENERATOR AT 0300.

LUKE
COME ON, ARTOO.  WE'LL NEED YOUR SCANNERS.

LUKE, CHEWIE, HAN, AND THE DROIDS MOVE OFF IN ONE DIRECTION AS THE
SQUAD PROCEEDS IN ANOTHER.

THREEPIO
DON'T WORRY, MASTER LUKE.  WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.

THEY MOVE OFF INTO THE WOODS.

THREEPIO	 (TO ARTOO)
AND YOU SAID IT WAS PRETTY HERE. UGH!

67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE

A STRANGE LITTLE FURRY FACE WITH HUGE BLACK EYES COMES SLOWLY INTO
VIEW. THE CREATURE IS AN EWOK, BY THE NAME OF WICKET. HE SEEMS SOMEWHAT
PUZZLED, AND PRODS LEIA WITH A SPEAR. THE PRINCESS GROANS; THIS
FRIGHTENS THE STUBBY BALL OF FUZZ AND HE PRODS HER AGAIN. LEIA SITS UP
AND STARES AT THE THREE-FOOT-HIGH EWOK. SHE TRIES TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
SHE IS AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED. HER CLOTHES ARE TORN; SHE'S BRUISED AND
DISHEVELED.

THE EWOK JUMPS UP AND GRABS A FOUR-FOOT-LONG SPEAR, WHICH HE HOLDS IN A
DEFENSIVE POSITION. LEIA WATCHES HIM AS HE CIRCLES WARILY AND BEGINS
POKING HER WITH THE SHARP POINT OF THE SPEAR.

LEIA
CUT IT OUT!

SHE STANDS UP, AND THE EWOK QUICKLY BACKS AWAY.

LEIA
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

LEIA LOOKS AROUND AT THE DENSE FOREST, AND AT THE CHARRED REMAINS OF
HER SPEEDER BIKE, THEN SITS DOWN, WITH A SIGH, ON A FALLEN LOG.

LEIA
WELL, LOOKS LIKE I'M STUCK HERE. TROUBLE IS, I DON'T KNOW WHERE HERE
IS.

SHE PUTS HER HEAD IN HER HANDS TO RUB AWAY SOME OF THE SORENESS FROM
HER FALL. SHE LOOKS OVER AT THE WATCHFUL LITTLE EWOK AND PATS THE LOG
BESIDE HER.

LEIA
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME. COME ON, SIT DOWN.

WICKET HOLDS HIS SPEAR UP WARILY AND GROWLS AT HER LIKE A PUPPY. LEIA
PATS THE LOG AGAIN.

LEIA
I PROMISE I WON'T HURT YOU. NOW COME HERE.

MORE GROWLS AND SQUEAKS FROM THE LITTLE BEAR CREATURE.

LEIA
ALL RIGHT. YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

SHE TAKES A SCRAP OF FOOD OUT OF HER POCKET AND OFFERS IT TO HIM.
WICKET TAKES A STEP BACKWARD, THEN COCKS HIS HEAD AND MOVES CAUTIOUSLY
TOWARD LEIA, CHATTERING IN HIS SQUEAKY EWOK LANGUAGE.

LEIA
THAT'S RIGHT. COME ON. HMMM?

SNIFFING THE FOOD CURIOUSLY, THE EWOK COMES TOWARD LEIA AND SITS ON THE
LOG BESIDE HER. SHE TAKES OFF HER HELMET, AND THE LITTLE CREATURE JUMPS
BACK, STARTLED AGAIN. HE RUNS ALONG THE LOG, POINTING HIS SPEAR AT HER
AND CHATTERING A BLUE STREAK. LEIA HOLDS OUT THE HELMET TO HIM.

LEIA
LOOK, IT'S A HAT. IT'S NOT GONNA HURT YOU. LOOK. YOU'RE A JITTERY
LITTLE THING, AREN'T YOU?

REASSURED, WICKET LOWERS HIS SPEAR AND CLIMBS BACK ON THE LOG, COMING
TO INVESTIGATE THE HELMET. SUDDENLY HIS EARS PERK UP AND HE BEGINS TO
SNIFF THE AIR. HE LOOKS AROUND WARILY, WHISPERING SOME EWOKESE WARNING
TO LEIA.

LEIA
WHAT IS IT?

SUDDENLY A LASER BOLT COMES OUT OF THE FOLIAGE AND EXPLODES ON THE LOG
NEXT TO LEIA. LEIA AND WICKET BOTH ROLL BACKWARDS OFF THE LOG, HIDING
BEHIND IT. LEIA HOLDS HER OWN LASER GUN READY, WHILE WICKET DISAPPEARS
UNDERNEATH THE LOG. ANOTHER SHOT, AND STILL NO SIGHT OF ANYONE IN THE
FOREST. THEN LEIA SENSES SOMETHING AND TURNS TO FIND A LARGE IMPERIAL
SCOUT STANDING OVER HER WITH HIS WEAPON POINTED AT HER HEAD. HE REACHES
OUT HIS HAND FOR HER WEAPON.

SCOUT #L
FREEZE!  COME ON, GET UP!

SHE HANDS THE WEAPON OVER, AS A SECOND SCOUT EMERGES FROM THE FOLIAGE
IN FRONT OF THE LOG.

SCOUT #1
GO GET YOUR RIDE AND TAKE HER BACK TO BASE.

SCOUT #2
YES, SIR.

THE SECOND SCOUT STARTS TOWARD HIS BIKE, AS WICKET, CROUCHED UNDER THE
LOG, EXTENDS HIS SPEAR AND HITS THE FIRST SCOUT ON THE LEG. THE SCOUT
JUMPS AND LETS OUT AN EXCLAMATION, AND LOOKS DOWN AT WICKET, PUZZLED.
LEIA GRABS A BRANCH AND KNOCKS HIM OUT. SHE DIVES FOR HIS LASER PISTOL,
AND THE SECOND SCOUT, NOW ON HIS BIKE, TAKES OFF. LEIA FIRES AWAY AND
HITS THE ESCAPING BIKE, CAUSING IT TO CRASH INTO THE FIRST SCOUT'S
BIKE, WHICH FLIES END OVER END AND EXPLODES. THE FOREST IS QUIET ONCE
MORE. WICKET POKES HIS FUZZY HEAD UP FROM BEHIND THE LOG AND REGARDS
LEIA WITH�NEW RESPECT. HE MUMBLES HIS AWE. LEIA HURRIES OVER, LOOKING
AROUND ALL THE TIME, AND MOTIONS THE CHUBBY LITTLE CREATURE INTO THE
DENSE FOLIAGE.

LEIA
COME ON, LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

AS THEY MOVE INTO THE FOLIAGE, WICKET TAKES THE LEAD. HE SHRIEKS AND
TUGS AT LEIA TO FOLLOW HIM.

68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER

DARTH VADER WALKS DOWN THE CORRIDOR TO THE EMPEROR'S TOWER AND PRIVATE
ELEVATOR. THE EMPEROR'S PRIVATE GUARD STEPS IN VADER'S PATH.

GUARD
HALT! THE EMPEROR DOES NOT WISH TO BE DISTURBED AT THE MOMENT.

VADER
(RAISING HIS GLOVED HAND TO THE TWO GUARDS AND CHOKING THEM WITH THE
FORCE)
THE EMPEROR WILL SEE ME, NOW!

GUARD
(REPEATING VADER'S COMMAND)
THE EMPEROR WILL SEE YOU, NOW.

69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

TWO RED IMPERIAL GUARDS STAND WATCH AT THE ELEVATOR AS THE DOOR OPENS
TO REVEAL VADER. VADER ENTERS THE EERIE, FOREBODING THRONE ROOM. IT
APPEARS TO BE EMPTY. HIS FOOTSTEPS ECHO AS HE APPROACHES THE THRONE. HE
WAITS, ABSOLUTELY STILL. THE EMPEROR SITS WITH HIS BACK TO THE DARK
LORD.

EMPEROR
I TOLD YOU TO REMAIN ON THE COMMAND SHIP.

VADER
A SMALL REBEL FORCE HAS PENETRATED THE SHIELD AND LANDED ON ENDOR.

EMPEROR	 (NO SURPRISE)
YES, I KNOW.

VADER	 (AFTER A BEAT)
MY SON IS WITH THEM.

EMPEROR	 (VERY COOL)
ARE YOU SURE?

VADER
I HAVE FELT HIM, MY MASTER.

EMPEROR
STRANGE, THAT I HAVE NOT. I WONDER IF YOUR FEELINGS ON THIS MATTER ARE
CLEAR, LORD
VADER.

VADER KNOWS WHAT IS BEING ASKED.

VADER
THEY ARE CLEAR, MY MASTER.

EMPEROR
THEN YOU MUST GO TO THE SANCTUARY MOON AND WAIT FOR THEM.

VADER	 (SKEPTICAL)
HE WILL COME TO ME?

EMPEROR
I HAVE FORESEEN IT. HIS COMPASSION FOR YOU WILL BE HIS UNDOING. HE WILL
COME TO YOU AND
THEN YOU WILL BRING HIM BEFORE ME.

VADER	 (BOWS)
AS YOU WISH.

THE DARK LORD STRIDES OUT OF THE THRONE ROOM.

70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE

HAN, LUKE, CHEWIE, AND THE TWO DROIDS ARE SPREAD OUT AS THEY MOVE
THROUGH THE HEAVY FOLIAGE NEAR THE CLEARING WHERE WE LAST SAW LEIA.
LUKE FINDS LEIA'S HELMET, PICKS IT UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONCERN.

HAN	 (OS)
LUKE! LUKE!

LUKE RUNS WITH THE HELMET TO WHERE HAN HAS FOUND THE CHARRED WRECKAGE
OF A SPEEDER BIKE IN THE GRASS.

THREEPIO
OH, MASTER LUKE.

LUKE
THERE'S TWO MORE WRECKED SPEEDERS BACK THERE. AND I FOUND THIS.

HE TOSSES THE HELMET TO HAN.

THREEPIO
I'M AFRAID THAT ARTOO'S SENSORS CAN FIND NO TRACE OF PRINCESS LEIA.

HAN	 (GRAVELY)
I HOPE SHE'S ALRIGHT.

CHEWBACCA GROWLS, SNIFFING THE AIR, THEN, WITH A BARK, PUSHES OFF
THROUGH THE FOLIAGE.

                              HAN
WHAT, CHEWIE? WHAT? CHEWIE!

THE OTHERS RUSH TO KEEP UP WITH THE GIANT WOOKIEE. AS HE SCOOTS ALONG,
ARTOO WHISTLES NERVOUSLY.

71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE

THE GROUP HAS REACHED A BREAK IN THE UNDERGROWTH. CHEWIE WALKS UP TO A
TALL STAKE PLANTED IN THE GROUND. THERE IS A DEAD ANIMAL HANGING FROM
IT.

HAN
HEY, I DON'T GET IT.

THE REST OF THE GROUP JOINS THE WOOKIEE AROUND THE STAKE.

HAN	 (CONT)
NAH, IT'S JUST A DEAD ANIMAL, CHEWIE.

CHEWIE CAN'T RESIST. HE REACHES TOWARD THE MEAT.

LUKE
CHEWIE, WA-WAIT!  DON'T!

TOO LATE. THE WOOKIEE HAS ALREADY PULLED THE ANIMAL FROM THE STAKE.
SPROOING! THE GROUP FINDS ITSELF HANGING UPSIDE DOWN IN AN EWOK NET,
SUSPENDED HIGH ABOVE THE CLEARING. ARTOO LETS OUT A WILD SERIES OF
BEEPS AND WHISTLES, AND CHEWIE HOWLS HIS REGRET. THEIR BODIES ARE A
JUMBLE IN THE NET. HAN REMOVES A WOOKIEE PAW FROM HIS MOUTH.

HAN
NICE WORK. GREAT, CHEWIE! GREAT! ALWAYS THINKING WITH YOUR STOMACH.

LUKE
WILL YOU TAKE IT EASY? LET'S JUST FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET OUT OF THIS
THING.
(TRYING TO FREE AN ARM)
HAN, CAN YOU REACH MY LIGHTSABER?

HAN
YEAH, SURE.

ARTOO IS AT THE BOTTOMMOST POINT IN THE NET. HE EXTENDS HIS CUTTING
APPENDAGE AND BEGINS SLICING AT THE NET. HAN IS TRYING TO SQUEEZE AN
ARM PAST THREEPIO TO GET AT LUKE'S LIGHTSABER. THE NET CONTINUES TO
SPIN.

THREEPIO
ARTOO, I'M NOT SURE THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA. IT'S A VERY LONG DRO-O-
OP!!

ARTOO HAS CUT THROUGH AND THE ENTIRE GROUP TUMBLES OUT OF THE NET,
CRASHING TO THE GROUND. AS THEY REGAIN THEIR SENSES AND SIT UP, THEY
REALIZE THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF EWOKS, EACH BRANDISHING A LONG
SPEAR.

HAN
WHA--?  HEY!  POINT THAT THING SOMEPLACE ELSE.

HAN PUSHES THE SPEAR WIELDED BY TEEBO OUT OF HIS FACE AND A SECOND EWOK
WARRIOR COMES UP TO ARGUE WITH TEEBO. THE SPEAR RETURNS TO HAN'S FACE.
HE GRABS IT ANGRILY AND STARTS TO GO FOR HIS LASER PISTOL.

HAN
HEY!

LUKE
HAN, DON'T. IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

THE EWOKS SWARM THROUGH THEM AND CONFISCATE THEIR WEAPONS. LUKE LETS
THEM TAKE HIS LIGHTSABER. CHEWIE GROWLS AT THE FURRY CRITTERS.

LUKE
CHEWIE, GIVE 'EM YOUR CROSSBOW.

ARTOO AND THREEPIO ARE JUST UNTANGLING THEMSELVES. THREEPIO GETS FREE
OF THE NET AND SITS UP, RATTLED.

THREEPIO
OH, MY HEAD. OH, MY GOODNESS!

WHEN THE EWOKS SEE THREEPIO, THEY LET OUT A GASP AND CHATTER AMONG
THEMSELVES. THREEPIO SPEAKS TO THEM IN THEIR NATIVE TONGUE. THE EWOK
NEAREST HIM DROPS HIS SPEAR AND PROSTRATES HIMSELF BEFORE THE DROID. IN
A MOMENT, ALL THE EWOKS HAVE FOLLOWED SUIT. CHEWIE LETS OUT A PUZZLED
BARK. HAN AND LUKE REGARD THE BOWED CREATURES IN WONDER. THE EWOKS
BEGIN TO CHANT AT THREEPIO.

LUKE
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THEY'RE SAYING?

THREEPIO
OH, YES, MASTER LUKE!  REMEMBER THAT I AM FLUENT IN OVER SIX MILLION
FORMS OF
COMMUNICATION.

HAN
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING THEM?

THREEPIO
HELLO, I THINK... I COULD BE MISTAKEN. THEY'RE USING A VERY PRIMITIVE
DIALECT.  BUT
I DO BELIEVE THEY THINK I AM SOME SORT OF GOD.

CHEWBACCA AND ARTOO THINK THAT'S VERY FUNNY. HAN AND LUKE EXCHANGE
"WHAT NEXT?" LOOKS.

HAN
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU USE YOUR DIVINE INFLUENCE AND GET US OUT OF THIS?

THREEPIO
I BEG YOUR PARDON, GENERAL SOLO, BUT THAT JUST WOULDN'T BE PROPER.

HAN
PROPER?!

THREEPIO
IT'S AGAINST MY PROGRAMMING TO IMPERSONATE A DEITY.

HAN MOVES TOWARD THREEPIO THREATENINGLY.

HAN
WHY, YOU--

SEVERAL EWOKS' SPEARS ARE THRUST IN HAN'S FACE AT THE AFFRONT TO THEIR
GOD. THE EWOKS MOVE IN TO PROTECT THEIR GOD AND HAN IS SURROUNDED BY A
MENACING CIRCLE OF SPEARS, ALL AIMED AT HIM. HE HOLDS UP HIS HANDS
PLACATINGLY.

HAN
MY MISTAKE. HE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE.

72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS

A PROCESSION OF EWOKS WINDS THROUGH THE EVER-DARKENING FOREST. THEIR
PRISONERS - HAN, LUKE, CHEWIE, AND ARTOO - ARE TIED TO LONG POLES AND
WRAPPED IN VINES, COCOONLIKE.

EACH POLE IS CARRIED ON THE SHOULDERS OF SEVERAL EWOKS. BEHIND THE
CAPTIVES, THREEPIO IS CARRIED ON A LITTER, LIKE A KING, BY THE
REMAINING CREATURES.

73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST

THE PROCESSION MOVES ALONG A SHAKY, NARROW, WOODEN WALKWAY, HIGH IN THE
GIANT TREES. IT STOPS AT THE END OF THE WALKWAY, WHICH DROPS OFF INTO
NOTHINGNESS. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ABYSS IS A VILLAGE OF MUD HUTS
AND RICKETY WALKWAYS, ATTACHED TO THE GIANT TREES. THE LEAD EWOK TAKES
HOLD OF A LONG VINE AND SWINGS ACROSS TO THE VILLAGE SQUARE; THE OTHER
EWOKS FOLLOW SUIT.

74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE

THE PROCESSION WINDS ITS WAY INTO THE VILLAGE SQUARE. MOTHER EWOKS
GATHER THEIR BABIES UP AND SCURRY INTO THEIR HUTS AT THE SIGHT OF THE
NEWCOMERS. THE GROUP STOPS BEFORE THE LARGEST HUT.

HAN, LUKE, CHEWIE, AND ARTOO ARE STILL BOUND TO THEIR POLES. HAN IS
PLACED ON A SPIT ABOVE WHAT LOOKS LIKE A BARBECUE PIT AND THE OTHERS
ARE LEANED AGAINST A TREE NEARBY. THREEPIO'S LITTER/THRONE IS GENTLY
PLACED NEAR THE PIT. HE WATCHES WITH RAPT FASCINATION. HAN, LUKE, AND
CHEWIE ARE LESS THAN FASCINATED.

HAN
I HAVE A REALLY BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

CHEWIE GROWLS HIS CONCERN.

SUDDENLY ALL ACTIVITY STOPS AS LOGRAY, THE TRIBAL MEDICINE MAN, COMES
OUT OF THE BIG HUT. HE EXAMINES THE CAPTIVES CAREFULLY, GOES TO JOIN
THREEPIO, WHOSE THRONE HAS BEEN PLACED ON AN ELEVATED PLATFORM. A
LARGER, GRAY-HAIRED EWOK, CHIEF CHIRPA, IS EXAMINING LUKE'S LIGHTSABER
WITH GREAT CURIOSITY.

LOGRAY SPEAKS TO THREEPIO AND THE ASSEMBLAGE OF FUZZY EWOKS, POINTING
TO THE PRISONERS TIED TO THE STAKES. THE EWOKS BEGIN FILLING THE PIT
UNDER HAN WITH FIREWOOD.

HAN
WHAT DID HE SAY?

THREEPIO
I'M RATHER EMBARRASSED, GENERAL SOLO, BUT IT APPEARS YOU ARE TO BE THE
MAIN COURSE AT A
BANQUET IN MY HONOR.

THE DRUMS START BEATING, AND ALL THE FURRY HEADS TURN TO THE LARGE HUT.
LEIA EMERGES, WEARING AN ANIMAL-SKIN DRESS. SHE SEES WHAT'S HAPPENING
AT THE SAME MOMENT THE PRISONERS SEE HER.

HAN AND LUKE
LEIA!

AS SHE MOVES TOWARD THEM, THE EWOKS BLOCK HER WAY WITH RAISED SPEARS.

LEIA
OH!

THREEPIO
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

ARTOO AND CHEWIE CHIME IN WITH THEIR WELCOME. LEIA LOOKS AT THE
ASSEMBLED EWOKS AND SIGHS.

LEIA
BUT THESE ARE MY FRIENDS. THREEPIO, TELL THEM THEY MUST BE SET FREE.

THREEPIO TALKS TO CHIRPA AND LOGRAY, WHO LISTEN AND SHAKE THEIR HEADS
NEGATIVELY. THE MEDICINE MAN GESTURES TOWARD THE PRISONERS AND BARKS
SOME ORDERS. SEVERAL EWOKS JUMP UP AND PILE MORE WOOD ON THE BARBECUE
WITH VIGOR. LEIA TRADES FRANTIC LOOKS WITH LUKE AND HAN .

HAN
SOMEHOW, I GOT THE FEELING THAT DIDN'T HELP US VERY MUCH.

LUKE
THREEPIO, TELL THEM IF THEY DON'T DO AS YOU WISH, YOU'LL BECOME ANGRY
AND USE YOUR MAGIC.

THREEPIO
BUT MASTER LUKE, WHAT MAGIC? I COULDN'T POSSIBLY --

LUKE
JUST TELL THEM.

THREEPIO SPEAKS TO THE EWOKS. THE EWOKS ARE DISTURBED. LOGRAY STEPS
FORWARD AND CHALLENGES THREEPIO. LUKE CLOSES HIS EYES AND BEGINS TO
CONCENTRATE.

THREEPIO
YOU SEE, MASTER LUKE; THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME. JUST...

NOW THE LITTER/THRONE, WITH THREEPIO SITTING UPON IT, RISES FROM THE
GROUND. AT FIRST THREEPIO DOESN'T NOTICE AND KEEPS TALKING.

THREEPIO
... AS I SAID THEY WOULDN'T. WHA-WHA-WHAT'S HAPPENING! OH! OH, DEAR!
OH!

THE EWOKS FALL BACK IN TERROR FROM THE FLOATING THRONE. NOW THREEPIO
BEGINS TO SPIN AS THOUGH HE WERE ON A REVOLVING STOOL, WITH THREEPIO
CALLING OUT IN TOTAL PANIC AT HIS SITUATION.

THREEPIO
PUT ME DOWN! HE-E-ELP! MASTER LUKE! ARTOO! SOMEBODY, SOMEBODY, HELP!
MASTER LUKE, ARTOO! ARTOO, QUICKLY! DO SOMETHING, SOMEBODY! OH! OHHH!

CHIEF CHIRPA YELLS ORDERS TO THE COWERING EWOKS. THEY RUSH UP AND
RELEASE THE BOUND PRISONERS. LUKE AND HAN ENFOLD LEIA IN A GROUP
EMBRACE. LUKE NOTICES THE SPINNING THREEPIO, WITH ARTOO BEEPING UP AT
HIM, AND SLOWLY LOWERS THE GOLDEN DROID AND THE THRONE TO THE GROUND.
LOGRAY ORDERS THE LITTLE DROID CUT DOWN. ARTOO CRASHES TO THE GROUND.
WHEN THE EWOKS SET HIM UPRIGHT, THE LITTLE DROID IS FIGHTING MAD. ARTOO
BEEPS A BLUE STREAK AT THE NEAREST EWOK, AND BEGINS PURSUING HIM,
FINALLY GETTING CLOSE ENOUGH TO ZAP HIM WITH AN ELECTRIC CHARGE. THE
EWOK JUMPS TWO FEET IN THE AIR AND RUNS AWAY, SCREAMING. A SMALL GROUP
OF EWOKS SURROUND THE GIANT WOOKIEE, SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND
MARVELING AT HIS HEIGHT.

THREEPIO
OH, OH, OH, OH! THANK GOODNESS.

LUKE
THANKS, THREEPIO.

THREEPIO	 (STILL SHAKEN)
I...I NEVER KNEW I HAD IT IN ME.

75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS

A GLOWING FIRE DANCES IN THE CENTER OF THE SPARTAN, LOW-CEILINGED ROOM,
CREATING A KALEIDOSCOPE OF SHADOWS ON THE WALLS. ALONG ONE SIDE, A
GROUP OF TEN EWOK ELDERS FLANK CHIEF CHIRPA, WHO SITS ON HIS THRONE.
THE REBELS SIT ALONG THE WALLS OF THE HUT, WITH THREEPIO BETWEEN THE
TWO GROUPS AND WICKET AND TEEBO OFF TO ONE SIDE.

THREEPIO IS IN THE MIDST OF A LONG, ANIMATED SPEECH IN THE EWOK'S
SQUEAKY NATIVE TONGUE. THE EWOKS LISTEN CAREFULLY AND OCCASIONALLY
MURMUR COMMENTS TO EACH OTHER. THREEPIO POINTS SEVERAL TIMES AT THE
REBEL GROUP AND PANTOMIMES A SHORT HISTORY OF THE GALACTIC CIVIL WAR,
MIMICKING THE EXPLOSION AND ROCKET SOUNDS, IMITATING IMPERIAL WALKERS.
THROUGHOUT THE LONG ACCOUNT, CERTAIN FAMILIAR NAMES ARE DISTINGUISHABLE
IN ENGLISH: PRINCESS LEIA, ARTOO, DARTH VADER, DEATH STAR, JEDI, OBI-
WAN KENOBI. ARTOO BEGINS BEEPING EXCITEDLY AT THREEPIO.

THREEPIO
YES, ARTOO. I WAS JUST COMING TO THAT.

THREEPIO CONTINUES WITH: MILLENNIUM FALCON, CLOUD CITY, VADER, HAN
SOLO, CARBONITE, SARLACC, BRINGING THE HISTORY UP TO THE PRESENT TIME.

AT THE END OF IT, THE CHIEF, LOGRAY, AND THE ELDERS CONFER, THEN NOD IN
AGREEMENT. THE CHIEF STANDS AND MAKES A PRONOUNCEMENT.

THE DRUMS BEGIN TO SOUND, AND ALL THE EWOKS STAND WITH A GREAT CHEER
AND SCREECHES.

HAN
WHAT'S GOING ON?

LEIA
I DON'T KNOW.

LUKE HAS BEEN SHARING THE JOY WITH SMILING VISAGE, BUT NOW SOMETHING
PASSES LIKE A DARK CLOUD THROUGH HIS CONSCIOUSNESS. THE OTHERS DO NOT
NOTICE.

THREEPIO
WONDERFUL! WE ARE NOW A PART OF THE TRIBE.

SEVERAL OF THE LITTLE TEDDY BEARS RUN UP AND HUG THE REBELS.

HAN
JUST WHAT I ALWAYS WANTED.

CHEWBACCA IS BEING ENTHUSIASTICALLY EMBRACED BY AN EWOK, WHILE WICKET
CLINGS TO HAN'S LEG.

HAN	 (CHUCKLES)
WELL, SHORT HELP IS BETTER THAN NO HELP AT ALL, CHEWIE.
(TO WICKET)
THANK YOU. OKAY.

THREEPIO
HE SAYS THE SCOUTS ARE GOING TO SHOW US THE QUICKEST WAY TO THE SHIELD
GENERATOR.

CHEWIE BARKS. LUKE HAS DRIFTED TO THE BACK OF THE HUT. NOW HE WANDERS
OUTSIDE INTO THE MOONLIGHT. LEIA NOTICES AND FOLLOWS.

HAN
GOOD. HOW FAR IS IT? ASK HIM. WE NEED SOME FRESH SUPPLIES, TOO. AND TRY
AND GET OUR WEAPONS BACK.

HAN PULLS THREEPIO BACK AS HE KEEPS TRYING TO TRANSLATE.

HAN	 (CONT)
AND HURRY UP, WILL YA? I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.

76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT

THE WALKWAY IS DESERTED NOW. THE WINDOWS OF THE LITTLE HUTS GLOW AND
FLICKER FROM THE FIRES INSIDE. THE SOUNDS OF THE FOREST FILL THE SOFT
NIGHT AIR. LUKE HAS WANDERED AWAY FROM THE CHIEF'S HUT AND STANDS
STARING UP AT THE DEATH STAR. LEIA FINDS HIM LIKE THAT.

LEIA
LUKE, WHAT'S WRONG?

LUKE TURNS AND LOOKS AT HER A LONG MOMENT.

LUKE
LEIA... DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR MOTHER? YOUR REAL MOTHER?

LEIA
JUST A LITTLE BIT. SHE DIED WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG.

LUKE
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER?

LEIA
JUST...IMAGES, REALLY. FEELINGS.

LUKE
TELL ME.

LEIA
(A LITTLE SURPRISED AT HIS INSISTENCE)
SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL. KIND, BUT...SAD.
(LOOKS UP)
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME ALL THIS?

HE LOOKS AWAY.

LUKE
I HAVE NO MEMORY OF MY MOTHER. I NEVER KNEW HER.

LEIA
LUKE, TELL ME. WHAT'S TROUBLING YOU?

LUKE
VADER IS HERE...NOW, ON THIS MOON.

LEIA	 (ALARMED)
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

LUKE
I FELT HIS PRESENCE. HE'S COME FOR ME. HE CAN FEEL WHEN I'M NEAR.
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO GO.
(FACING HER)
AS LONG AS I STAY, I'M ENDANGERING THE GROUP AND OUR MISSION HERE.
(BEAT)
I HAVE TO FACE HIM.

LEIA IS DISTRAUGHT, CONFUSED.

LEIA
WHY?

LUKE MOVES CLOSE AND HIS MANNER IS GENTLE. AND VERY CALM.

LUKE
HE'S MY FATHER.

LEIA
YOUR FATHER?

LUKE
THERE'S MORE. IT WON'T BE EASY FOR YOU TO HEAR IT, BUT YOU MUST. IF I
DON'T MAKE IT BACK, YOU'RE THE ONLY HOPE FOR THE ALLIANCE.

LEIA IS VERY DISTURBED BY THIS. SHE MOVES AWAY, AS IF TO DENY IT.

LEIA
LUKE, DON'T TALK THAT WAY. YOU HAVE A POWER I--I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND
COULD NEVER HAVE.

LUKE
YOU'RE WRONG, LEIA. YOU HAVE THAT POWER TOO. IN TIME YOU'LL LEARN TO
USE IT AS I HAVE. THE FORCE IS STRONG IN MY FAMILY. MY FATHER HAS
IT...I HAVE IT...AND...MY SISTER HAS IT.

LEIA STARES INTO HIS EYES. WHAT SHE SEES THERE FRIGHTENS HER. BUT SHE
DOESN'T DRAW AWAY. SHE BEGINS TO UNDERSTAND.

LUKE
YES. IT'S YOU LEIA.

LEIA
I KNOW. SOMEHOW...I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

LUKE
THEN YOU KNOW WHY I HAVE TO FACE HIM.

LEIA
NO! LUKE, RUN AWAY, FAR AWAY. IF HE CAN FEEL YOUR PRESENCE, THEN LEAVE
THIS PLACE. I WISH I COULD GO WITH YOU.

LUKE
NO, YOU DON'T. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN STRONG.

LEIA
BUT, WHY MUST YOU CONFRONT HIM?

LUKE
BECAUSE...THERE IS GOOD IN HIM. I'VE FELT IT. HE WON'T TURN ME OVER TO
THE EMPEROR. I CAN SAVE HIM. I CAN TURN HIM BACK TO THE GOOD SIDE. I
HAVE TO TRY.

THEY HOLD EACH OTHER CLOSE AND LOOK AT EACH OTHER, BROTHER AND SISTER.

LEIA HOLDS BACK HER TEARS AS LUKE SLOWLY LETS HER GO AND MOVES AWAY. HE
DISAPPEARS ONTO THE WALKWAY THAT LEADS OUT OF THE VILLAGE. LEIA, BATHED
IN MOONLIGHT, WATCHES HIM GO AS HAN COMES OUT OF THE CHIEF'S HUT AND
COMES OVER TO HER. LEIA IS CRYING, HER BODY TREMBLING. HE REALIZES ONLY
NOW THAT SHE IS CRYING.

HAN
HEY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

LEIA ATTEMPTS TO STIFLE HER SOBS AND WIPES HER EYES.

LEIA
NOTHING. I - JUST WANT TO BE ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

HAN	 (ANGRY)
NOTHING?  COME ON, TELL ME.  WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

SHE LOOKS UP AT HIM, STRUGGLING TO CONTROL HERSELF.

LEIA
I...I CAN'T TELL YOU.

HAN	 (LOSES HIS TEMPER)
DID YOU TELL LUKE? IS THAT WHO YOU COULD TELL?

LEIA
I...

HAN
AHHH...

HE STARTS TO WALK AWAY, EXASPERATED, THEN STOPS AND WALKS BACK TO HER.

HAN
I'M SORRY.

LEIA
HOLD ME.

HAN GATHERS HER TIGHTLY IN HIS PROTECTIVE EMBRACE.

77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM

AN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE FLOATS DOWN FROM THE DEATH STAR AND LANDS
GRACEFULLY ON THE HUGE PLATFORM.

NOW, AN IMPERIAL WALKER APPROACHES THE PLATFORM FROM THE DARKNESS OF
THE FOREST. THE WHOLE OUTPOST - PLATFORM, WALKERS, MILITARY - LOOKS
PARTICULARLY OFFENSIVE IN THE MIDST OF THIS VERDANT BEAUTY.

78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK

DARTH VADER WALKS DOWN THE RAMP OF THE SHUTTLE ONTO THE PLATFORM, INTO
AN ELEVATOR, AND APPEARS ON A RAMP ON A LOWER LEVEL. HE WALKS TOWARD
ANOTHER RAMP EXIT AND IS MET BY TWO TROOPERS AND A COMMANDER WITH LUKE,
IN BINDERS, AT THEIR CENTER. THE YOUNG JEDI GAZES AT VADER WITH
COMPLETE CALM.

COMMANDER
THIS IS A REBEL THAT SURRENDERED TO US. ALTHOUGH HE DENIES IT, I
BELIEVE THERE MAY BE MORE OF THEM, AND I REQUEST PERMISSION TO CONDUCT
A FURTHER SEARCH OF THE AREA.

THE COMMANDER EXTENDS HIS HAND, REVEALING LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.

COMMANDER
HE WAS ARMED ONLY WITH THIS.

VADER LOOKS AT LUKE, TURNS AWAY AND FACES THE COMMANDER, TAKING THE
LIGHTSABER FROM THE COMMANDER'S HAND.

VADER
GOOD WORK, COMMANDER. LEAVE US. CONDUCT YOUR SEARCH AND BRING HIS
COMPANIONS TO ME.

COMMANDER
YES, MY LORD.

THE OFFICER AND TROOPS WITHDRAW. VADER AND LUKE ARE LEFT STANDING ALONE
IN THE ODDLY TRANQUIL BEAUTY OF THE PLACE. THE SOUNDS OF THE FOREST
FILTER IN UPON THEM.

VADER
THE EMPEROR HAS BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

LUKE
I KNOW, FATHER.

VADER
SO, YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE TRUTH.

LURE
I'VE ACCEPTED THE TRUTH THAT YOU WERE ONCE ANAKIN SKYWALKER, MY FATHER.

VADER	 (TURNING TO FACE HIM)
THAT NAME NO LONGER HAS ANY MEANING FOR ME.

LUKE
IT IS THE NAME OF YOUR TRUE SELF. YOU'VE ONLY FORGOTTEN. I KNOW THERE
IS GOOD IN YOU. THE EMPEROR HASN'T DRIVEN IT FROM YOU FULLY. THAT IS
WHY YOU COULDN'T DESTROY ME. THAT'S WHY YOU WON'T BRING ME TO YOUR
EMPEROR NOW.

VADER LOOKS DOWN FROM LUKE TO THE LIGHTSABER IN HIS OWN BLACK- GLOVED
HAND. HE SEEMS TO PONDER LUKE'S WORDS.

VADER	 (INDICATING LIGHTSABER)
I SEE YOU HAVE CONSTRUCTED A NEW LIGHTSABER.

VADER IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER AND HOLDS IT TO EXAMINE ITS HUMMING,
BRILLIANT BLADE.

VADER
YOUR SKILLS ARE COMPLETE. INDEED, YOU ARE POWERFUL, AS THE EMPEROR HAS
FORESEEN.

THEY STAND FOR A MOMENT, THE VADER EXTINGUISHES THE LIGHTSABER.

LUKE
COME WITH ME.

VADER
OBI-WAN ONCE THOUGHT AS YOU DO.

LUKE STEPS CLOSE TO VADER, THEN STOPS. VADER IS STILL.

VADER
YOU DON'T KNOW THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE. I MUST OBEY MY MASTER.

LUKE
I WILL NOT TURN...AND YOU'LL BE FORCED TO KILL ME.

VADER
IF THAT IS YOUR DESTINY.

LUKE
SEARCH YOUR FEELINGS, FATHER. YOU CAN'T DO THIS. I FEEL THE CONFLICT
WITHIN YOU. LET GO
OF YOUR HATE.

VADER
IT IS TOO LATE FOR ME, SON. THE EMPEROR WILL SHOW YOU THE TRUE NATURE
OF THE FORCE. HE IS
YOUR MASTER NOW.

VADER SIGNALS TO SOME DISTANT STORMTROOPERS. HE AND LUKE STAND STARING
AT ONE ANOTHER FOR A LONG MOMENT.

LUKE
THEN MY FATHER IS TRULY DEAD.

79   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR

HAN, LEIA, CHEWBACCA, THE DROIDS, WICKET, AND ANOTHER EWOK SCOUT,
PAPLOO, HIDE ON A RIDGE OVERLOOKING THE MASSIVE IMPERIAL SHIELD
GENERATOR. AT THE BASE OF THE GENERATOR IS AN IMPERIAL LANDING
PLATFORM. LEIA STUDIES THE INSTALLATION.

LEIA
THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE CONTROL BUNKER'S ON THE FAR SIDE OF THAT
LANDING PLATFORM. THIS
ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

HAN
HEY, DON'T WORRY. CHEWIE AND ME GOT INTO A LOT OF PLACES MORE HEAVILY
GUARDED THAN THIS.

WICKET AND PAPLOO ARE CHATTERING AWAY IN EWOK LANGUAGE. THEY SPEAK TO
THREEPIO.

LEIA
WHAT'S HE SAYING?

THREEPIO
HE SAYS THERE'S A SECRET ENTRANCE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIDGE.

80   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

THE VAST FLEET HANGS IN SPACE NEAR A BLUE PLANET. A GIANT REBEL STAR
CRUISER IS UP AT THE FRONT, BUT NOW THE MILLENNIUM FLACON ROARS UP TO A
SPOT AHEAD OF IT, TINY IN COMPARISON.

81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

LANDO IS IN THE PILOT SEAT. HIS ALIEN COPILOT, NIEN NUNB, TAKES SOME
GETTING USED TO IN THE FAMILIAR ENVIRONS OF THE FALCON'S COCKPIT. LANDO
SPEAKS INTO HIS COMLINK.

LANDO
ADMIRAL, WE'RE IN POSITION. ALL FIGHTERS ACCOUNTED FOR.

ACKBAR 	(VO)
PROCEED WITH THE COUNTDOWN. ALL GROUPS ASSUME ATTACK COORDINATES.

LANDO TURNS TO HIS WEIRD COPILOT.

LANDO
DON'T WORRY, MY FRIENDS ARE DOWN THERE. THEY'LL HAVE THAT SHIELD DOWN
ON TIME...
(TO HIMSELF)
OR THIS'LL BE THE SHORTEST OFFENSIVE OF ALL TIME.

THE COPILOT FLIPS SOME SWITCHES AND GRUNTS AN ALIEN COMMENT.

ACKBAR	 (VO)
ALL CRAFT, PREPARE TO JUMP TO HYPERSPACE ON MY MARK.

LANDO
ALL RIGHT. STAND BY.

HE PULLS A LEVER, AND THE STARS OUTSIDE BEGIN TO STREAK.

82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

WE ARE TREATED TO AN AWESOME SIGHT: FIRST THE MILLENNIUM FALCON, THEN
ACKBAR'S STAR CRUISER, THEN, IN LARGE SEGMENTS, THE HUGE FLEET ROARS
INTO HYPERSPACE. AND DISAPPEARS.

83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER

HAN, LEIA, CHEWIE, THE DROIDS, AND THEIR TWO EWOK GUIDES, WICKET AND
PAPLOO, HAVE REUNITED WITH THE REBEL STRIKE SQUAD. THE ENTIRE GROUP IS
SPREAD THROUGH THE THICK UNDERGROWTH. BELOW THEM IS THE BUNKER THAT
LEADS INTO THE GENERATOR. FOUR IMPERIAL SCOUTS, THEIR SPEEDER BIKES
PARKED NEARBY, KEEP WATCH OVER THE BUNKER ENTRANCE. CHEWIE GROWLS AN
OBSERVATION, AND PAPLOO CHATTERS AWAY TO HAN IN EWOK LANGUAGE.

HAN
BACK DOOR, HUH? GOOD IDEA.

WICKET AND PAPLOO CONTINUE THEIR EWOK CONVERSATION.

HAN	 (CONT)
IT'S ONLY A FEW GUARDS. THIS SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

LEIA
WELL, IT ONLY TAKES ONE TO SOUND THE ALARM.

HAN	 (WITH SELF-CONFIDENT GRIN)
THEN WE'LL DO IT REAL QUIET-LIKE.

THREEPIO EXPLAINS WHAT IS GOING ON TO WICKET AND PAPLOO. THE EWOKS
CHATTER A MOMENT BETWEEN THEMSELVES. THEN PAPLOO JUMPS UP AND SCAMPERS
INTO THE UNDERBRUSH.

THREEPIO ASKS WICKET WHERE PAPLOO WENT AND IS GIVEN A SHORT REPLY.

THREEPIO
OH! OH, MY. UH, PRINCESS LEIA!

LEIA
QUIET.

THREEPIO
I'M AFRAID OUR FURRY COMPANION HAS GONE AND DONE SOMETHING RATHER RASH.

LEIA
OH, NO.

84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE

PAPLOO HAS SLIPPED OUT OF THE UNDERGROWTH NEAR WHERE THE IMPERIAL
SCOUTS ARE LOUNGING. HE SILENTLY SWINGS HIS FURRY BALL OF A BODY ONTO
ONE OF THE SCOUT'S SPEEDER BIKES AND BEGINS FLIPPING SWITCHES AT
RANDOM. SUDDENLY, THE BIKE'S ENGINE FIRES UP WITH A TREMENDOUS ROAR.
PAPLOO GRINS AND CONTINUES FLIPPING SWITCHES. THE SCOUTS LEAP UP IN
SURPRISE.

85   EXT RIDGE

HAN, LEIA AND COMPANY WATCH IN DISTRESS. CHEWIE BARKS.

HAN 	(SIGHS)
THERE GOES OUR SURPRISE ATTACK.

86   EXT BUNKER

THE IMPERIAL SCOUTS RACE TOWARD PAPLOO JUST AS HIS SPEEDER ZOOMS INTO
MOTION. PAPLOO HANGS ON BY HIS PAWS AND SHOOTS AWAY INTO THE FOREST.

SCOUT
LOOK! OVER THERE! STOP HIM!

THREE OF THE IMPERIAL SCOUTS JUMP ON THEIR ROCKET BIKES AND SPEED AWAY
IN PURSUIT. THE FOURTH WATCHES THEM GO FROM HIS POST AT THE DOOR.

87   EXT RIDGE

HAN, LEIA, AND CHEWIE EXCHANGE DELIGHTED LOOKS.

HAN
NOT BAD FOR A LITTLE FURBALL. THERE'S ONLY ONE LEFT. YOU STAY HERE.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

HAN AND THE WOOKIEE NOD AT EACH OTHER AND SLIP DOWN TOWARD THE BUNKER.
THREEPIO MOVES TO STAND NEXT TO WICKET AND ARTOO.

THREEPIO
I HAVE DECIDED THAT WE SHALL STAY HERE.

88   EXT FOREST

PAPLOO SAILS THROUGH THE TREES, MORE LUCKY THAN IN CONTROL. IT'S SCARY,
BUT HE LOVES IT. WHEN THE IMPERIAL SCOUTS PULL WITHIN SIGHT BEHIND HIM
AND BEGIN FIRING LASER BOLTS, HE DECIDES HE'S HAD ENOUGH. AS HE ROUNDS
A TREE, OUT OF THEIR SIGHT, PAPLOO GRABS A VINE AND SWINGS UP INTO THE
TREES. A MOMENT LATER, THE SCOUTS TEAR UNDER HIM IN PURSUIT OF THE
STILL-FLYING, UNOCCUPIED BIKE.

89   EXT BUNKER

HAN SNEAKS UP BEHIND THE REMAINING IMPERIAL SCOUT, TAPS HIM ON THE
SHOULDER AND LETS THE SCOUT CHASE HIM BEHIND THE BUNKER INTO THE ARMS
OF THE WAITING REBEL STRIKE TEAM. HAN RETURNS TO THE FRONT, AND TAPS
OUT A PATTERN ON THE BUNKER DOOR'S CONTROL PANEL. EVERYONE STANDS OUT
OF SIGHT, POLICE-STYLE, AS THE DOOR OPENS. HAN AND LEIA PEEK INSIDE. NO
SIGN OF LIFE. THE GROUP ENTERS THE BUNKER SILENTLY, LEAVING ONE LOOKOUT
BEHIND.

90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

THE ELEVATOR OPENS. VADER AND LUKE ENTER THE ROOM ALONE. THEY WALK
ACROSS THE DARK SPACE TO STAND BEFORE THE THRONE, FATHER AND SON SIDE
BY SIDE BENEATH THE GAZE OF THE EMPEROR. VADER BOWS TO HIS MASTER.

EMPEROR
WELCOME, YOUNG SKYWALKER. I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

LUKE PEERS AT THE HOODED FIGURE DEFIANTLY. THE EMPEROR THEN LOOKS DOWN
AT LUKE'S BINDERS.

EMPEROR
YOU NO LONGER NEED THOSE.

THE EMPEROR MOTIONS EVER SO SLIGHTLY WITH HIS FINGER AND LUKE'S BINDERS
FALL AWAY, CLATTERING TO THE FLOOR. LUKE LOOKS DOWN AT HIS OWN HANDS,
FREE NOW TO REACH OUT AND GRAB THE EMPEROR'S NECK. HE DOES NOTHING.

EMPEROR
GUARDS, LEAVE US.

THE RED-CLOAKED GUARDS TURN AND DISAPPEAR BEHIND THE ELEVATOR.

EMPEROR	 (TO LUKE)
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO COMPLETING YOUR TRAINING. IN TIME YOU WILL CALL
ME MASTER.

LUKE
YOU'RE GRAVELY MISTAKEN. YOU WON'T CONVERT ME AS YOU DID MY FATHER.

THE EMPEROR GETS DOWN FROM HIS THRONE AND WALKS UP VERY CLOSE TO LUKE.
THE EMPEROR LOOKS INTO HIS EYES AND, FOR THE FIRST TIME, LUKE CAN
PERCEIVE THE EVIL VISAGE WITHIN THE HOOD.

EMPEROR
OH, NO, MY YOUNG JEDI. YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS YOU WHO ARE
MISTAKEN...ABOUT A GREAT MANY THINGS.

VADER
HIS LIGHTSABER.

VADER EXTENDS A GLOVED HAND TOWARD THE EMPEROR, REVEALING LUKE'S
LIGHTSABER. THE EMPEROR TAKES IT.

EMPEROR
AH, YES, A JEDI'S WEAPON. MUCH LIKE YOUR FATHER'S. BY NOW YOU MUST KNOW
YOUR FATHER CAN NEVER BE TURNED FROM THE DARK SIDE. SO WILL IT BE WITH
YOU.

LUKE
YOU'RE WRONG. SOON I'LL BE DEAD...AND YOU WITH ME.

THE EMPEROR LAUGHS.

EMPEROR
PERHAPS YOU REFER TO THE IMMINENT ATTACK OF YOUR REBEL FLEET.

LUKE LOOKS UP SHARPLY.

EMPEROR
YES...I ASSURE YOU WE ARE QUITE SAFE FROM YOUR FRIENDS HERE.

VADER LOOKS AT LUKE.

LUKE
YOUR OVERCONFIDENCE IS YOUR WEAKNESS.

EMPEROR
YOUR FAITH IN YOUR FRIENDS IS YOURS.

VADER
IT IS POINTLESS TO RESIST, MY SON.

THE EMPEROR TURNS TO FACE LUKE.

EMPEROR	 (ANGRY)
EVERYTHING THAT HAS TRANSPIRED HAS DONE SO ACCORDING TO MY DESIGN.
(INDICATES ENDOR)
YOUR FRIENDS UP THERE ON THE SANCTUARY MOON...

LUKE REACTS. THE EMPEROR NOTES IT.

EMPEROR	 (CONT)
...ARE WALKING INTO A TRAP. AS IS YOUR REBEL FLEET! IT WAS I WHO
ALLOWED THE ALLIANCE TO KNOW THE LOCATION OF THE SHIELD GENERATOR. IT
IS QUITE SAFE FROM YOUR PITIFUL LITTLE BAND. AN ENTIRE LEGION OF MY
BEST TROOPS AWAITS THEM.

LUKE'S LOOK DARTS FROM THE EMPEROR TO VADER AND, FINALLY, TO THE SWORD
IN THE EMPEROR'S HAND.

EMPEROR
OH...I'M AFRAID THE DEFLECTOR SHIELD WILL BE QUITE OPERATIONAL WHEN
YOUR FRIENDS ARRIVE.

91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM

HAN, LEIA, CHEWIE, AND THE REBEL STRIKE TEAM STORM THROUGH A DOOR AND
ENTER THE MAIN CONTROL ROOM, TAKING ALL OF THE PERSONNEL PRISONER.

HAN
ALL RIGHT! UP! MOVE! COME ON! QUICKLY! QUICKLY, CHEWIE.

THE REBEL TROOPS HERD THE GENERATOR CONTROLLERS AWAY FROM THEIR PANELS.
LEIA GLANCES AT ONE OF THE SCREENS ON THE CONTROL PANEL.

LEIA
HAN! HURRY! THE FLEET WILL BE HERE ANY MOMENT.

HAN
CHARGES!  COME ON, COME ON!

OUTSIDE, THREEPIO WATCHES NERVOUSLY IN THE BUSHES AS SEVERAL MORE
CONTROLLERS AND STORMTROOPERS RUN INTO THE BUNKER, LEAVING GUARDS AT
THE DOOR.

THREEPIO	 (TO WICKET)
OH, MY! THEY'LL BE CAPTURED!

WICKET CHATTERS IN EWOK LANGUAGE, AND THEN TAKES OFF FULL STEAM INTO
THE FOREST.

THREEPIO
WA-WAIT! WAIT, COME BACK! ARTOO, STAY WITH ME.

INSIDE THE BUNKER, HAN LOOKS UP FROM SETTING CHARGES AS AN IMPERIAL
COMMANDER ENTERS.

COMMANDER
FREEZE! YOU REBEL SCUM.

HAN AND LEIA SPIN, TO FIND DOZENS OF IMPERIAL WEAPONS TRAINED ON THEM
AND THEIR COHORTS. A POISED FORCE OF IMPERIAL TROOPS SURROUND THEM.
EVEN MORE POUR INTO THE ROOM, ROUGHLY DISARMING THE REBEL CONTINGENT.
HAN, LEIA, AND CHEWIE EXCHANGE LOOKS. THEY'RE HELPLESS.

92   EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET

THE DEATH STAR AND ITS SANCTUARY MOON HANG DISTANT IN SPACE AS THE
REBEL FLEET COMES OUT OF HYPERSPACE WITH AN AWESOME ROAR. THE
MILLENNIUM FALCON AND SEVERAL REBEL FIGHTERS ARE AT THE FRONT AS THE
SPACE ARMADA BEARS DOWN ON ITS TARGET.

93   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

95   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

LANDO LOOKS WORRIEDLY AT HIS ALIEN COPILOT, NIEN NUNB, WHO POINTS TO
THE CONTROL PANEL AND TALKS TO LANDO.

LANDO
WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME KIND OF A READING ON THAT SHIELD, UP
OR DOWN. WELL, HOW
COULD THEY BE JAMMING US IF THEY DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE COMING.

LANDO SHOOTS A CONCERNED LOOK OUT AT THE APPROACHING DEATH STAR AS THE
IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT HE'S JUST SAID SINK IN. HE HITS A SWITCH ON HIS
COMLINK.

LANDO
BREAK OFF THE ATTACK! THE SHIELD IS STILL UP.

RED LEADER	 (VO)
I GET NO READING. ARE YOU SURE?

LANDO
PULL UP! ALL CRAFT PULL UP!

THE FALCON TURNS HARD TO THE LEFT. OUT THE WINDOW THE STARS AND THE
DEATH STAR MOVE OFF RIGHT.

96   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELD

THE FALCON AND THE FIGHTERS OF RED SQUAD VEER OFF DESPERATELY TO AVOID
THE UNSEEN WALL.

97   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

ALARMS ARE SCREAMING AND LIGHTS FLASHING AS THE HUGE SHIP CHANGES
COURSE ABRUPTLY. OTHER SHIPS IN THE FLEET SHOOT BY OUTSIDE AS THE
ARMADA TRIES TO HALT ITS FORWARD MOMENTUM.

ACKBAR
TAKE EVASIVE ACTION! GREEN GROUP, STICK CLOSE TO HOLDING SECTOR MV-7.

A MON CALAMARI CONTROLLER TURNS AWAY FROM HIS SCREEN AND CALLS OUT TO
ACKBAR, QUITE EXCITED. THE ADMIRAL RUSHES OVER TO THE CONTROLLER.

CONTROLLER
ADMIRAL, WE HAVE ENEMY SHIPS IN SECTOR 47.

ON THE SCREEN CAN BE SEEN THE MOON, DEATH STAR, AND THE MASSIVE
IMPERIAL FLEET. ACKBAR MOVES TO THE COMLINK.

ACKBAR
IT'S A TRAP!

LANDO	 (OVER COMLINK)
FIGHTERS COMING IN.

THERE IS MUCH EXCITEMENT ON THE BRIDGE AS THE ATTACK BEGINS.

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON AND SEVERAL SQUADS OF REBEL FIGHTERS HEAD INTO AN
ARMADA OF TIE FIGHTERS. THE SKY EXPLODES AS A FIERCE DOGFIGHT ENSUES IN
AND AROUND THE GIANT REBEL CRUISERS.

REBEL PILOT
THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM!

LANDO
ACCELERATE TO ATTACK SPEED! DRAW THEIR FIRE AWAY FROM THE CRUISERS.

WEDGE

98   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

THROUGH THE ROUND WINDOW BEHIND THE EMPEROR'S THRONE CAN BE SEEN THE
DISTANT FLASHES OF THE SPACE BATTLE IN PROGRESS.

EMPEROR
COME, BOY. SEE FOR YOURSELF.

THE EMPEROR IS SITTING IN HIS THRONE, WITH VADER STANDING AT HIS SIDE.
LUKE MOVES TO LOOK THROUGH A SMALL SECTION OF THE WINDOW.

EMPEROR
FROM HERE YOU WILL WITNESS THE FINAL DESTRUCTION OF THE ALLIANCE, AND
THE END OF YOUR INSIGNIFICANT REBELLION.

LUKE IS IN TORMENT. HE GLANCES AT HIS LIGHTSABER SITTING ON THE ARMREST
OF THE THRONE. THE EMPEROR WATCHES HIM AND SMILES, TOUCHES THE
LIGHTSABER.

EMPEROR
YOU WANT THIS, DON'T YOU? THE HATE IS SWELLING IN YOU NOW. TAKE YOUR
JEDI WEAPON. USE IT. I AM UNARMED. STRIKE ME DOWN WITH IT. GIVE IN TO
YOUR ANGER. WITH EACH PASSING MOMENT, YOU MAKE YOURSELF MORE MY
SERVANT.

VADER WATCHES LUKE IN HIS AGONY.

LUKE
NO!

EMPEROR
IT IS UNAVOIDABLE. IT IS YOUR DESTINY. YOU, LIKE YOUR FATHER, ARE NOW
MINE!

99   EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

HAN, LEIA, CHEWIE, AND THE REST OF THE STRIKE TEAM ARE LED OUT OF THE
BUNKER BY THEIR CAPTORS. THE SURROUNDING AREA, DESERTED BEFORE, IS NOW
CROWDED WITH TWO-LEGGED IMPERIAL WALKERS AND HUNDREDS OF IMPERIAL
TROOPS. THE SITUATION LOOKS HOPELESS.

STORMTROOPER
ALL RIGHT, MOVE IT! I SAID MOVE IT! GO ON!

FROM THE UNDERGROWTH BEYOND THE CLEARING COMES A WILD SERIES OF BEEPS
AND WHISTLES.
AND --

THREEPIO
HELLO! I SAY, OVER THERE! WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ME?

BUNKER COMMANDER
BRING THOSE TWO DOWN HERE!

STORMTROOPER
LET'S GO!

ARTOO AND THREEPIO ARE STANDING NEAR ONE OF THE BIG TREES. AS SIX
IMPERIAL STORMTROOPERS RUSH OVER TO TAKE THEM CAPTIVE, THE TWO DROIDS
DUCK OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND THE TREE.

THREEPIO
WELL, THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY. ARTOO, ARE YOU SURE THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?

STORMTROOPER
FREEZE! DON'T MOVE!

THREEPIO
WE SURRENDER.

THE STORMTROOPERS COME AROUND THE TREE AND FIND THE TWO DROIDS WAITING
QUIETLY TO BE TAKEN. AS THE IMPERIAL TROOPS MOVE TO DO THAT, HOWEVER, A
BAND OF EWOKS DROPS DOWN FROM ABOVE AND OVERPOWERS THEM.

THREEPIO
OHHH! STAND BACK, ARTOO.

IN A NEARBY TREE, AN EWOK RAISES A HORN TO HIS LIPS AND SOUNDS THE EWOK
ATTACK CALL. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE AS HUNDREDS OF EWOKS THROW THEIR
FUZZY BODIES INTO THE FRAY AGAINST THE ASSEMBLED STORMTROOPERS AND
THEIR AWESOME TWO-LEGGED WALKERS. BIKER SCOUTS DART ABOUT BLASTING
EWOKS, ONLY TO BE CRUSHED BY A VOLLEY OF ROCKS TOSSED BY EWOKS FROM THE
TREES ABOVE.

IN THE CONFUSION OF THE BATTLE, HAN AND LEIA BREAK AWAY AND DIVE FOR
THE COVER OF THE BUNKER DOOR AS EXPLOSIONS ERUPT AROUND THEM. HAN GOES
TO THE BUNKER DOOR CONTROL PANEL.

LEIA
THE CODE'S CHANGED. WE NEED ARTOO!

HAN
HERE'S THE TERMINAL.

LEIA	 (INTO COMLINK)
ARTOO, WHERE ARE YOU? WE NEED YOU AT THE BUNKER RIGHT AWAY.

ARTOO AND THREEPIO ARE HIDING BEHIND A LOG AS THE BATTLE RAGESAROUND
THEM. SUDDENLY THE STUBBY LITTLE ASTRODROID LETS OUT A SERIES OF
WHISTLES AND SHOOTS OFF ACROSS THE BATTLEFIELD. THREEPIO, PANICKED,
RUNS AFTER HIM.

THREEPIO
GOING? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE GOING. BUT-- BUT GOING WHERE, ARTOO?
NO, WHAT! ARTOO! OH, THIS IS NO TIME FOR HEROICS. COME BACK!

BIKER SCOUTS RACE AROUND AND OVER THE TWO DROIDS, BLASTING AWAY AT THE
LITTLE EWOKS AS THE FURRIES SCURRY FOR COVER.

A GROUP OF EWOKS HAVE MOVED A PRIMITIVE CATAPULT INTO POSITION. THEY
FIRE OFF A LARGE BOULDER THAT HITS ONE OF THE WALKERS. THE WALKER TURNS
AND HEADS FOR THE CATAPULT, BLASTING AWAY WITH BOTH GUNS. THE EWOKS
ABANDON THEIR WEAPONS AND FLEE IN ALL DIRECTIONS. JUST AS THE WALKER
MOVES IN TO STOMP THE CATAPULT, EWOKS DROP VINES RESTRAINING TWO HUGE
LOGS THAT SWING DOWN AND SMASH THEWALKER'S HEAD FLAT.

A LINE OF EWOKS HANG DESPERATELY TO A VINE THAT IS HOOKED TO A WALKER'S
FOOT. AS THE WALKER MOVES ALONG, THE FUZZY CREATURES ARE DRAGGED
BEHIND.

TWO SPEEDER BIKES CHASE EWOKS THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH. AS THE SCOUTS
ROUND A TREE, THEY ARE KNOCKED OFF THEIR BIKES BY A VINETIED BETWEEN
TWO TREES.

OH, ARTOO, HURRY!

THE LITTLE DROID MOVES TO THE TERMINAL AND PLUGS IN HIS COMPUTER ARM. A
LARGE EXPLOSION HITS NEAR ARTOO, KNOCKING HIM HEAD OVER HEELS, FINALLY
LANDING ON HIS FEET. THE STUBBY ASTRODROID'S HEAD IS SPINNING AND
SMOLDERING. SUDDENLY THERE IS A LOUD SPROOING AND HAN AND LEIA TURN
AROUND TO SEE ARTOO WITH ALL HIS COMPARTMENT DOORS OPEN, AND ALL OF HIS
APPENDAGES STICKING OUT; WATER AND SMOKE SPURT OUT OF THE NOZZLES IN
HIS BODY. HAN RUSHES TO THE TERMINAL, AS THREEPIO RUSHES TO HIS WOUNDED

LASER BLASTS AT FRANTIC EWOKS RUNNING IN ALL DIRECTIONS.  TWO EWOKS ARE
STRUCK DOWN BY LASER BLASTS.  ONE TRIES TO AWAKEN HIS FRIEND, THEN
REALIZES THAT HE IS DEAD.

112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR

THE REBEL FLEET CONTINUES TO BE PICKED OFF, FROM ONE SIDE BY THE DEATH
STAR'S DEADLY BEAM, FROM THE OTHER BY THE RAMPAGING IMPERIAL STAR
DESTROYERS.

113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

LANDO STEERS THE FALCON WILDLY THROUGH AN OBSTACLE COURSE OF FLOATING
GIANTS. HE'S BEEN YELLING INTO THE COMLINK.

LANDO	 (DESPERATELY)
YES! I SAID CLOSER! MOVE AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN AND ENGAGE THOSE STAR
DESTROYERS AT POINT-
BLANK RANGE.

ACKBAR
AT THAT CLOSE RANGE, WE WON'T LAST LONG AGAINST THOSE STAR DESTROYERS.

LANDO
WE'LL LAST LONGER THEN WE WILL AGAINST THAT DEATH STAR...AND WE MIGHT
JUST TAKE A FEW OF
THEM WITH US.

THE REBEL CRUISERS MOVE VERY CLOSE TO THE IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYERS AND
BEGIN TO BLAST AWAY AT POINT-BLANK RANGE. TINY FIGHTERS RACE ACROSS THE
GIANT SURFACES, AGAINST A BACKDROP OF LASER FIRE.

THE CONTROL TOWER OF A STAR DESTROYER IS UNDER ATTACK.

REBEL PILOT
SHE'S GONNA BLOW!

Y-WING PILOT
I'M HIT!

THE DAMAGED Y-WING PLUMMETS TOWARD THE STAR DESTROYER, AND CRASHES INTO
THE CONTROL TOWER, EXPLODING.

114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

OUT OF THE WINDOW AND ON THE VIEW SCREENS, THE REBEL FLEET IS BEING
DECIMATED IN BLINDING EXPLOSIONS OF LIGHT AND DEBRIS. BUT IN HERE THERE
IS NO SOUND OF BATTLE. THE EMPEROR TURNS TO LUKE.

EMPEROR
YOUR FLEET HAS LOST. AND YOUR FRIENDS ON THE ENDOR MOON WILL NOT
SURVIVE. THERE IS NO ESCAPE, MY YOUNG APPRENTICE. THE ALLIANCE WILL
DIE...AS WILL YOUR FRIENDS.

LUKE'S EYES ARE FULL OF RAGE. VADER WATCHES HIM.

EMPEROR
GOOD. I CAN FEEL YOUR ANGER. I AM DEFENSELESS.  TAKE YOUR WEAPON!
STRIKE ME DOWN WITH ALL YOUR HATRED, AND YOUR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE DARK
SIDE WILL BE COMPLETE.

LUKE CAN RESIST NO LONGER. THE LIGHTSABER FLIES INTO HIS HAND. HE
IGNITES IT IN AN INSTANT AND SWINGS AT THE EMPEROR. VADER'S LIGHTSABER
FLASHES INTO VIEW, BLOCKING LUKE'S BLOW BEFORE IT CAN REACH THE
EMPEROR. THE TWO BLADES SPARK AT CONTACT. LUKE TURNS TO FIGHT HIS
FATHER.

115  EXT FOREST

THE BATTLE RAGES ON. STORMTROOPERS FIRE ON EWOKS WITH SOPHISTICATED
WEAPONS WHILE THEIR FURRY LITTLE ADVERSARIES SNEAK UP BEHIND THE
IMPERIAL TROOPERS AND BASH THEM OVER THE HEAD WITH LARGE CLUBS.

A WALKER MARCHES THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH BLASTING EWOKS AS IT GOES. AN
EWOK WARRIOR GIVES THE SIGNAL, AND A PILE OF LOGS IS CUT LOOSE. THE
LOGS TUMBLE UNDER THE WALKER'S FEET, CAUSING IT TO SLIP AND SLIDE UNTIL
IT FINALLY TOPPLES OVER WITH A GREAT CRASH.

A SCOUT BIKE RACES PAST AND IS LASSOED WITH A HEAVY VINE. THE OTHER END
OF THE VINE IS TIED TO A TREE, AND THE BIKE SWINGS AROUND IN EVER-
TIGHTENING CIRCLES UNTIL IT RUNS OUT OF ROPE AND
CRASHES INTO THE TREES WITH A HUGE EXPLOSION.

CHEWIE SWINGS ON A VINE TO THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE WALKERS. TWO EWOKS
CLING TO HIM. THEY LAND WITH A THUD ON THE TOP OF THE LURCHING MACHINE,
THEN HANG ON FOR DEAR LIFE. ONE OF THE EWOKS PEEKS THROUGH THE WINDOW.

WALKER PILOT #1
LOOK!

PILOT #2
GET HIM OFF OF THERE!

THE WALKER PILOT OPENS THE HATCH TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. HE IS YANKED
OUT AND TOSSED OVERBOARD BEFORE HE CAN SCREAM. THE TWO EWOKS JUMP INTO
THE COCKPIT AND KNOCK THE SECOND PILOT UNCONSCIOUS. THE EWOKS ARE
THROWN VIOLENTLY AS THE MIGHTY MACHINE CAREENS OUT OF CONTROL. OUTSIDE,
CHEWIE IS ALMOST KNOCKED OVERBOARD; HE STICKS HIS HEAD INTO THE HATCH
WITH A SERIES OF ANGRY BARKS. THE EWOKS ARE TOO BUSY AND FRIGHTENED TO
LISTEN TO THE WOOKIEE'S COMPLAINT. CHEWIE SLIPS INSIDE THE WALKER.

CHEWBACCA'S WALKER MOVES THROUGH THE FOREST, FIRING LASER BLASTS AT
UNSUSPECTING STORMTROOPERS, AND DESTROYING OTHER IMPERIAL WALKERS. THE
EWOKS SHOUT AND CHEER AS THE GIANT MACHINE HELPS TURN THE TIDE OF THE
BATTLE IN THEIR FAVOR.

116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

HAN WORKS FURIOUSLY AT THE CONTROL PANEL; WIRES SPARK AS HE ATTEMPTS TO
HOTWIRE THE DOOR. HE MOTIONS TO LEIA, WHO IS BLASTING AWAY AT SOME
STORMTROOPERS.

HAN
I THINK I GOT IT. I GOT IT!

THE THREE WIRES SPARK AS THE CONNECTION IS MADE. WITH A LOUD WHOOSH, A
SECOND BLAST DOOR CRASHES DOWN IN FRONT OF THE FIRST.

HAN FROWNS AND TURNS BACK TO THE WIRES AGAIN. LEIA EXCHANGES SHOTS WITH
STORMTROOPERS IN THE BUSHES, THEN SUDDENLY CRIES OUT IN PAIN, HER
SHOULDER HIT BY A LASER BLAST.

THREEPIO
OH, PRINCESS LEIA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

HAN
LET'S SEE.

LEIA
IT'S NOT BAD.

STORMTROOPER	 (OS)
FREEZE!

THEY FREEZE.

THREEPIO
OH, DEAR.

STORMTROOPER
DON'T MOVE!

LEIA HOLDS HER LASER GUN READY, BEHIND HAN, OUT OF VIEW OF THE TWO
STORMTROOPERS MOVING TOWARD THEM. HAN AND LEIA'S EYES LOCK; THE MOMENT
SEEMS SUSPENDED IN TIME.

HAN
I LOVE YOU.

ANOTHER SHARED LOOK BETWEEN THEM, AS SHE SMILES UP AT HAN.

LEIA
I KNOW.

STORMTROOPER
HANDS UP! STAND UP!

HAN STANDS UP SLOWLY AND TURNS, REVEALING THE GUN IN LEIA'S HAND. SHE
DISPOSES OF THE STORMTROOPERS IN A FLASH. AS HAN TURNS BACK TOWARD
LEIA, HE LOOKS UP TO SEE A GIANT WALKER APPROACH AND STAND BEFORE HIM,
ITS DEADLY WEAPONS AIMED RIGHT AT HIM.

HAN	 (TO LEIA)
STAY BACK.

THE HATCH ON TOP OF THE WALKER OPENS AND CHEWIE STICKS HIS HEAD OUT AND
BARKS TRIUMPHANTLY.

HAN
CHEWIE!  GET DOWN HERE!  SHE'S WOUNDED!  NO, WAIT....  I GOT AN IDEA.

117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

LUKE AND VADER ARE ENGAGED IN A MAN-TO-MAN DUEL OF LIGHTSABERS EVEN
MORE VICIOUS THEN THE BATTLE ON BESPIN. BUT THE YOUNG JEDI HAS GROWN
STRONGER IN THE INTERIM, AND NOW THE ADVANTAGE SHIFTS TO HIM. VADER IS
FORCED BACK, LOSING HIS BALANCE, AND IS KNOCKED DOWN THE STAIRS. LUKE
STANDS AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, READY TO ATTACK.

EMPEROR (LAUGHING)
GOOD.  USE YOUR AGGRESSIVE FEELINGS, BOY!  LET THE HATE FLOW THROUGH
YOU.

LUKE LOOKS MOMENTARILY TOWARD THE EMPEROR, THEN BACK TO VADER, AND
REALIZES HE IS USING THE DARK SIDE. HE STEPS BACK, TURNS OFF HIS
LIGHTSABER, AND RELAXES, DRIVING THE HATE FROM HIS BEING.

VADER
OBI-WAN HAS TAUGHT YOU WELL.

LUKE
I WILL NOT FIGHT YOU, FATHER.

VADER WALKS BACK UP THE STAIRS TO LUKE.

VADER
YOU ARE UNWISE TO LOWER YOUR DEFENSES.

VADER ATTACKS, FORCING LUKE ON THE DEFENSIVE. THE YOUNG JEDI LEAPS IN
AN AMAZING REVERSE FLIP UP TO THE SAFETY OF THE CATWALK OVERHEAD. VADER
STANDS BELOW HIM.

LUKE
YOUR THOUGHTS BETRAY YOU, FATHER. I FEEL THE GOOD IN YOU...THE
CONFLICT.

VADER
THERE IS NO CONFLICT.

LUKE
YOU COULDN'T BRING YOURSELF TO KILL ME BEFORE, AND I DON'T BELIEVE
YOU'LL DESTROY ME
NOW.

VADER
YOU UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE. IF YOU WILL NOT FIGHT,
THEN YOU WILL MEET
YOUR DESTINY.

VADER THROWS THE LASER SWORD AND IT CUTS THROUGH THE SUPPORTS HOLDING
THE CATWALK, THEN RETURNS TO VADER'S HAND. LUKE TUMBLES TO THE GROUND
IN A SHOWER OF SPARKS AND ROLLS OUT OF SIGHT UNDER THE EMPEROR'S
PLATFORM. VADER MOVES TO FIND HIM.

EMPEROR	 (LAUGHS)
GOOD.  GOOD.

118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE

THE TWO ARMADAS, LIKE THEIR SEA-BOUND ANCESTORS, BLAST AWAY AT EACH
OTHER IN INDIVIDUAL POINT-BLANK CONFRONTATIONS. A STAR DESTROYER
EXPLODES. THE REBEL VICTOR LIMPS AWAY, ITS BACK HALF ALIVE WITH A
SERIES OF MINOR EXPLOSIONS. THE REBEL CRUISER MANAGES TO MOVE IN NEXT
TO A SECOND STAR DESTROYER BEFORE IT EXPLODES COMPLETELY, TAKING THE
IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER WITH IT. THE FALCON AND SEVERAL FIGHTERS ATTACK
ONE OF THE LARGER IMPERIAL SHIPS.

LANDO
WATCH OUT. SQUAD AT .06.

REBEL PILOT
I'M ON IT, GOLD LEADER.

WEDGE
GOOD SHOT, RED TWO.

LANDO
NOW...COME ON, HAN, OLD BUDDY. DON'T LET ME DOWN.

119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM

CONTROLLERS WATCH THE MAIN VIEWSCREEN ON WHICH A VAGUE FIGURE OF AN
IMPERIAL WALKER PILOT CAN BE SEEN. THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF STATIC AND
INTERFERENCE.

HAN/PILOT	 (VO)
IT'S OVER, COMMANDER. THE REBELS HAVE BEEN ROUTED. THEY'RE FLEEING INTO
THE WOODS. WE
NEED REINFORCEMENTS TO CONTINUE THE PURSUIT.

THE CONTROLLERS CHEER.

CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER
SEND THREE SQUADS TO HELP. OPEN THE BACK DOOR.

SECOND COMMANDER
YES, SIR.

120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

AS THE DOOR TO THE BUNKER OPENS AND THE IMPERIAL TROOPS RUSH OUT,
THEY'RE SURPRISED TO FIND THEMSELVES SURROUNDED BY REBELS, THEIR
WEAPONS POINTED AT THEM. EWOKS HOLDING BOWS AND ARROWS APPEAR ON THE
ROOF OF THE BUNKER. THE IMPERIAL TROOPS THROW DOWN THEIR GUNS
AS HAN AND CHEWIE RUSH INSIDE THE BUNKER WITH EXPLOSIVE CHARGES.

121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM

HAN, CHEWIE, AND SEVERAL TROOPS RUSH INTO THE CONTROL ROOM AND PLANT
EXPLOSIVE CHARGES ON THE CONTROL PANELS AND RUSH OUT.

HAN
THROW ME ANOTHER CHARGE.

122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

VADER STALKS THE LOW-CEILINGED AREA ON THE LEVEL BELOW THE THRONE,
SEARCHING FOR LUKE IN THE SEMI-DARKNESS, HIS LIGHTSABER HELD READY.

VADER
YOU CANNOT HIDE FOREVER, LUKE.

LUKE
I WILL NOT FIGHT YOU.

VADER
GIVE YOURSELF TO THE DARK SIDE. IT IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SAVE YOUR
FRIENDS. YES, YOUR
THOUGHTS BETRAY YOU. YOUR FEELINGS FOR THEM ARE STRONG. ESPECIALLY
FOR...

VADER STOPS AND SENSES SOMETHING. LUKE SHUTS HIS EYES TIGHTLY, IN
ANGUISH.

VADER
SISTER! SO...YOU HAVE A TWIN SISTER. YOUR FEELINGS HAVE NOW BETRAYED
HER, TOO. OBI-WAN
WAS WISE TO HIDE HER FROM ME. NOW HIS FAILURE IS COMPLETE. IF YOU WILL
NOT TURN TO THE DARK
SIDE, THEN PERHAPS SHE WILL.

LUKE
NEVER-R-R!

LUKE IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER AND SCREAMS IN ANGER, RUSHING AT HISFATHER
WITH A FRENZY WE HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE. SPARKS FLY AS LUKE AND VADER
FIGHT IN THE CRAMPED AREA. LUKE'S HATRED FORCES VADER TO RETREAT OUT OF
THE LOW AREA AND ACROSS A BRIDGE OVERLOOKING A VAST ELEVATOR SHAFT.
EACH STROKE OF LUKE'S SWORD DRIVES HIS FATHER FURTHER TOWARD DEFEAT.

THE DARK LORD IS KNOCKED TO HIS KNEES, AND AS HE RAISES HIS SWORD TO
BLOCK ANOTHER ONSLAUGHT, LUKE SLASHES VADER'S RIGHT HAND OFF AT THE
WRIST, CAUSING METAL AND ELECTRONIC PARTS TO FLY FROM THE MECHANICAL
STUMP. VADER'S SWORD CLATTERS USELESSLY AWAY, OVER THE
EDGE OF THE PLATFORM AND INTO THE BOTTOMLESS SHAFT BELOW. LUKE MOVES
OVER VADER AND HOLDS THE BLADE OF HIS SWORD TO THE DARK LORD'S THROAT.
THE EMPEROR WATCHES WITH UNCONTROLLABLE, PLEASED AGITATION.

EMPEROR
GOOD! YOUR HATE HAS MADE YOU POWERFUL. NOW, FULFILL YOUR DESTINY AND
TAKE YOUR FATHER'S
PLACE AT MY SIDE!

LUKE LOOKS AT HIS FATHER'S MECHANICAL HAND, THEN TO HIS OWN MECHANICAL,
BLACK-GLOVED HAND, AND REALIZES HOW MUCH HE IS BECOMING LIKE HIS
FATHER. HE MAKES THE DECISION FOR WHICH HE HAS SPENT A LIFETIME IN
PREPARATION. LUKE STEPS BACK AND HURLS HIS LIGHTSABER AWAY.

LUKE
NEVER! I'LL NEVER TURN TO THE DARK SIDE. YOU'VE FAILED, YOUR HIGHNESS.
I AM A JEDI,
LIKE MY FATHER BEFORE ME.

THE EMPEROR'S GLEE TURNS TO RAGE.

EMPEROR
SO BE IT...JEDI.

123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

HAN AND SEVERAL OF THE FIGHTERS RUN OUT OF THE BUNKER AND RACE ACROSS
THE CLEARING.

HAN
MOVE! MOVE!

A SHOCK WAVE KNOCKS THEM FLAT AS THE BUNKER EXPLODES, FOLLOWED BY A
SPECTACULAR DISPLAY AS THE HUGE SHIELD-GENERATOR RADAR DISH EXPLODES
ALONG WITH THE BUNKER.

124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

ACKBAR, SITTING IN HIS CONTROL CHAIR, SPEAKS INTO THE RADIO.

ACKBAR
THE SHIELD IS DOWN! COMMENCE ATTACK ON THEDEATH STAR'S MAIN REACTOR.

LANDO
WE'RE ON OUR WAY. RED GROUP, GOLD GROUP, ALL FIGHTERS FOLLOW ME.
(LAUGHS)
TOLD YOU THEY'D DO IT!

THE FALCON, FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL SMALLER REBEL FIGHTERS, HEADS TOWARD
THE UNFINISHED SUPERSTRUCTURE OF THE DEATH STAR.

125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

LUKE STANDS STILL, AS THE EMPEROR REACHES THE BOTTOM OF THESTAIRS. THE
EMPEROR'S LAUGHTER HAS TURNED TO ANGER. HE RAISES HIS ARMS TOWARD LUKE.

EMPEROR
IF YOU WILL NOT BE TURNED, YOU WILL BE DESTROYED.

BLINDING BOLTS OF ENERGY, EVIL LIGHTNING, SHOOT FROM THE EMPEROR'S
HANDS AT LUKE. EVEN IN HIS SURPRISE, THE YOUNG JEDI TRIES TO USE THE
FORCE TO DEFLECT THEM. AT FIRST HE IS HALF SUCCESSFUL, BUT AFTER A
MOMENT THE BOLTS OF ENERGY ARE COMING WITH SUCH SPEED AND POWER THE
YOUNG JEDI SHRINKS BEFORE THEM, HIS KNEES BUCKLING. THE WOUNDED VADER
STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET, AND MOVES TO STAND AT HIS MASTER'S SIDE.

EMPEROR
YOUNG FOOL...ONLY NOW, AT THE END, DO YOU UNDERSTAND.

LUKE IS ALMOST UNCONSCIOUS BENEATH THE CONTINUING ASSAULT OF THE
EMPEROR'S LIGHTNING. HE CLUTCHES A CANISTER TO KEEP FROM FALLING INTO
THE BOTTOMLESS SHAFT AS THE BOLTS TEAR THROUGH HIM.

EMPEROR
YOUR FEEBLE SKILLS ARE NO MATCH FOR THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE. YOU
HAVE PAID THE PRICE FOR
YOUR LACK OF VISION.

LUKE WRITHES ON THE FLOOR IN UNBEARABLE PAIN, REACHING WEAKLY UP TOWARD
WHERE VADER STANDS WATCHING.

LUKE	 (GROANS)
FATHER, PLEASE. HELP ME.

AGAIN VADER STANDS, WATCHING LUKE. HE LOOKS AT HIS MASTER, THE EMPEROR,
THEN BACK TO LUKE ON THE FLOOR.

EMPEROR
NOW, YOUNG SKYWALKER...YOU WILL DIE.

ALTHOUGH IT WOULD NOT HAVE SEEMED POSSIBLE, THE OUTPOURING OF BOLTS
FROM THE EMPEROR'S FINGERS ACTUALLY INCREASES IN INTENSITY, THE SOUND
SCREAMING THROUGH THE ROOM. LUKE'S BODY WRITHES IN PAIN.

VADER GRABS THE EMPEROR FROM BEHIND, FIGHTING FOR CONTROL OF THE ROBED
FIGURE DESPITE THE DARK LORD'S WEAKENED BODY AND GRAVELY WEAKENED ARM.
THE EMPEROR STRUGGLES IN HIS EMBRACE, HIS BOLT-SHOOTING HANDS NOW
LIFTED HIGH, AWAY FROM LUKE. NOW THE WHITE LIGHTNING ARCS BACK TO
STRIKE AT VADER. HE STUMBLES WITH HIS LOAD AS THE SPARKS RAIN OFF HIS
HELMET AND FLOW DOWN OVER HIS BLACK CAPE. HE HOLDS HIS EVIL MASTER HIGH
OVER HIS HEAD AND WALKS TO THE EDGE OF THE ABYSS AT THE CENTRAL CORE OF
THE THRONE ROOM. WITH ONE FINAL BURST OF HIS ONCE AWESOME STRENGTH,
DARTH VADER HURLS THE EMPEROR'S BODY INTO THE BOTTOMLESS SHAFT.

THE EMPEROR'S BODY SPINS HELPLESSLY INTO THE VOID, ARCING AS IT FALLS
INTO THE ABYSS. FINALLY, WHEN THE BODY IS FAR DOWN THE SHAFT, IT
EXPLODES, CREATING A RUSH OF AIR THROUGH THE ROOM.VADER'S CAPE IS
WHIPPED BY THE WIND AND HE STAGGERS, AND COLLAPSES TOWARD THE
BOTTOMLESS HOLE. LUKE CRAWLS TO HIS FATHER'S SIDE AND PULLS HIM AWAY
FROM THE EDGE OF THE ABYSS TO SAFETY. BOTH THE YOUNG JEDI AND THE GIANT
WARRIOR ARE TOO WEAK TO MOVE.

126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR

REBEL FIGHTERS FOLLOW THE FALCON ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR
TO THE UNFINISHED PORTION, WHERE THEY DIVE INTO THE SUPERSTRUCTURE OF
THE GIANT BATTLE STATION, FOLLOWED BY MANY TIE FIGHTERS.

WEDGE
I'M GOING IN.

LANDO
HERE GOES NOTHING.

THREE X-WINGS LEAD THE CHASE THROUGH THE EVER-NARROWING SHAFT, FOLLOWED
BY THE FALCON AND FOUR OTHER FIGHTERS, PLUS TIE FIGHTERS WHO
CONTINUALLY FIRE AT THE REBELS. LIGHTS REFLECT OFF THE PILOT'S FACES AS
THEY RACE THROUGH THE DARK SHAFT.

LANDO
NOW LOCK ONTO THE STRONGEST POWER SOURCE. IT SHOULD BE THE POWER
GENERATOR.

WEDGE
FORM UP. AND STAY ALERT. WE COULD RUN OUT OF SPACE REAL FAST.

THE FIGHTERS AND THE FALCON RACE THROUGH THE TUNNEL, STILL PURSUED BY
THE TIE FIGHTERS. ONE OF THE X-WINGS IS HIT FROM BEHIND AND EXPLODES.

LANDO
SPLIT UP AND HEAD BACK TO THE SURFACE. SEE IF YOU CAN GET A FEW OF
THOSE TIE FIGHTERS TO
FOLLOW YOU.

PILOT
COPY, GOLD LEADER.

THE REBEL SHIPS PEEL OFF PURSUED BY THREE OF THE TIE'S, WHILE LANDO AND
WEDGE CONTINUE THROUGH THE MAIN TUNNEL. IT NARROWS, AND THE FALCON
SCRAPES THE SIDE DANGEROUSLY. TWO OTHER TIE FIGHTERS CONTINUE TO BLAST
AWAY AT THEM.

LANDO
THAT WAS TOO CLOSE.

NIEN NUNB AGREES. THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE REBEL AND IMPERIAL FLEET RAGES
ON. SEVERAL CRUISERS FIRE AT THE GIANT SUPER STAR DESTROYER.

127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

ADMIRAL PIETT AND A COMMANDER STAND AT THE WINDOW, LOOKING OUT TO THE
BATTLE. THEY LOOK CONCERNED.

CONTROLLER
SIR, WE'VE LOST OUR BRIDGE DEFLECTOR SHIELD.

PIETT
INTENSIFY THE FORWARD BATTERIES. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO GET THROUGH.

THE COMMANDER IS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW WHERE A DAMAGED REBEL
FIGHTER IS OUT OF CONTROL AND HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARD THE BRIDGE.

PIETT
INTENSIFY FORWARD FIREPOWER!

COMMANDER
IT'S TOO LATE!

THE REBEL PILOT SCREAMS AS HIS SHIP HITS THE STAR DESTROYER, CAUSING A
HUGE EXPLOSION. THE GIANT BATTLE SHIP LOSES CONTROL, CRASHES INTO THE
DEATH STAR, AND EXPLODES.

129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

THERE IS EXCITEMENT ON THE BRIDGE AS THE BATTLE RAGES ON ALL SIDES.
THEY CHEER AS THE GIANT STAR DESTROYER BLOWS UP.

130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY

CHAOS. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE DEATH STAR IS ROCKED BY EXPLOSIONS AS
THE REBEL FLEET, NO LONGER BACKED AGAINST A WALL, ZOOMS OVER, UNLOADING
A HEAVY BARRAGE. IMPERIAL TROOPS RUN IN ALL DIRECTIONS, CONFUSED AND
DESPERATE TO ESCAPE.

IN THE MIDST OF THIS UPROAR, LUKE IS TRYING TO CARRY THE ENORMOUS
DEADWEIGHT OF HIS FATHER'S WEAKENING BODY TOWARD AN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE.
FINALLY, LUKE COLLAPSES FROM THE STRAIN. THE EXPLOSIONS GROW LOUDER AS
VADER DRAWS HIM CLOSER.

VADER	 (A WHISPER)
LUKE, HELP ME TAKE THIS MASK OFF.

LURE
BUT YOU'LL DIE.

VADER
NOTHING CAN STOP THAT NOW. JUST FOR ONCE... LET ME LOOK ON YOU WITH MY
OWN EYES.

SLOWLY, HESITANTLY, LUKE REMOVES THE MASK FROM HIS FATHER'S FACE. THERE
BENEATH THE SCARS IS AN ELDERLY MAN. HIS EYES DO NOT FOCUS. BUT THE
DYING MAN SMILES AT THE SIGHT BEFORE HIM.

ANAKIN	 (VERY WEAK)
NOW...GO, MY SON. LEAVE ME.

LUKE
NO. YOU'RE COMING WITH ME. I CAN'T LEAVE YOU HERE. I'VE GOT TO SAVE
YOU.

ANAKIN
YOU ALREADY HAVE, LUKE. YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT ME. TELL YOUR SISTER...YOU
WERE RIGHT.

LUKE
FATHER...I WON'T LEAVE YOU.

DARTH VADER, ANAKIN SKYWALKER...LUKE'S FATHER, DIES.

A HUGE EXPLOSION ROCKS THE DOCKING BAY. SLOWLY, LUKE RISES AND, HALF
CARRYING, HALF DRAGGING THE BODY OF HIS FATHER, STUMBLES TOWARD A
SHUTTLE.

131  EXT DEATH STAR

THE MILLENNIUM FALCON LEADS A SWERVING BOMB RUN THROUGH THE IMMENSE
SUPERSTRUCTURE OF THE HALF-BUILT DEATH STAR. THE REBEL STAR CRUISERS
OUTSIDE CONTINUALLY BOMBARD THE HUGE STATION. AND EACH DIRECT HIT IS
ANSWERED BY RESONATING, CHAIN-REACTION EXPLOSIONS WITHIN THE STATION
ITSELF.

132  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS

LANDO'S CREW FIRES AWAY AT THE PURSUING TIE FIGHTERS AS THE DASHING
BARON OF BESPIN AND HIS ALIEN COPILOT HOME IN ON THE MAIN REACTOR
SHAFT. IT IS AWESOME. A LONE X-WING IS JUST IN FRONT OF THE FALCON.

WEDGE
THERE IT IS!

LANDO
ALL RIGHT, WEDGE. GO FOR THE POWER REGULATOR ON THE NORTH TOWER.

WEDGE
COPY, GOLD LEADER. I'M ALREADY ON MY WAY OUT.

THE X-WING HEADS FOR THE TOP OF THE HUGE REACTOR AND FIRES SEVERAL
PROTON TORPEDOES AT THE POWER REGULATOR, CAUSING A SERIES OF SMALL
EXPLOSIONS.

THE FALCON HEADS FOR THE MAIN REACTOR, AND WHEN IT IS DANGEROUSLY
CLOSE, LANDO FIRES THE MISSILES, WHICH SHOOT OUT OF THE FALCON WITH A
POWERFUL ROAR, AND HIT DIRECTLY AT THE CENTER OF THE MAIN REACTOR.

HE MANEUVERS THE FALCON OUT OF THE WINDING SUPERSTRUCTURE JUST AHEAD OF
THE CONTINUING CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS.

134  EXT DEATH STAR

AN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, WITH LUKE ALONE IN THE COCKPIT, ROCKETS OUT OF THE

AWAY.

FINALLY, JUST AS IT LOOKS LIKE THE FALCON WILL NOT MAKE IT, LANDO
EXPERTLY PILOTS THE CRAFT OUT OF THE EXPLODING SUPERSTRUCTURE AND
WHIZZES TOWARD THE SANCTUARY MOON, ONLY A MOMENT BEFORE THE DEATH STAR
SUPERNOVAS INTO OBLIVION.

LANDO RUNS IN AND IS ENTHUSIASTICALLY HUGGED BY HAN AND CHEWIE. THEN,
FINALLY, LUKE ARRIVES AND THE FRIENDS RUSH TO GREET AND EMBRACE HIM.
THEY STAND CLOSE, THIS HARDY GROUP, TAKING COMFORT IN EACH OTHER'S
TOUCH, TOGETHER TO THE END.

REBELS AND EWOKS JOIN TOGETHER IN DANCING AND CELEBRATION. THE ORIGINAL

QUI-GON : I DON'T SENSE ANYTHING.
OBI-WAN : IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MISSION, MASTER, IT'S
SOMETHGING...ELSEWHERE...ELUSIVE.
QUI-GON : DON'T CENTER ON YOUR ANXIETY, OBI-WAN. KEEP YOUR CONCENTRATION
HERE AND NOW WHERE IT BELONGS.
OBI-WAN : MASTER YODA SAYS I SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF THE FUTURE...
QUI-GON : .....BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MOMENT. BE MINDFUL OF THE
LIVING FORCE, MY YOUNG PADAWAN.
OBI-WAN : YES, MASTER...HOW DO YOU THINK THE TRADE VICEROY WILL DEAL WITH
THE CHANCELLOR'S DEMANDS?
QUI-GON : THESE FEDERATION TYPES ARE COWARDS. THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE
SHORT.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE GUNRAY AND DAULTRAY DOFINE STAND, STUNNED, BEFORE TC-14.

NUTE : (SHAKEN) WHAT?!? WHAT DID YOU SAY?
TC-14 : THE AMBASSADORS ARE JEDI KNIGHTS, I BELIEVE.
DOFINE : I KNEW IT! THEY WERE SENT TO FORCE A SETTLEMENT, EH. BLIND ME,
WE'RE DONE FOR!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY

A HOLOGRAM OF NUTE , SURROUNDED BY BATTLE DROIDS, APPEARS IN THE CONFERENCE
ROOM HALLWAY.

NUTE : THEY MUST BE DEAD BY NOW. BLAST, WHAT'S LEFT OF THEM.

THE HOLOGRAM FADES OFF, AS A BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, CAUTIOUSLY OPENS THE
DOOR. A DEADLY GREEN CLOUD BILLOWS FROM THE ROOM. BATTLE DROIDS COCK THEIR
WEAPONS AS A FIGURE STUMBLES OUT OF THE SMOKE. IT IS TC-14 , CARRYING THE
TRAY OF DRINKS.

TC14 : OH, EXCUSE ME, SO SORRY.

THE PROTOCOL DROID PASSES THE ARMED CAMP JUST AS TWO FLASHING LASER SWORDS
FLY OUT OF THE DEADLY FOG, CUTTING DOWN SEVERAL BATTLE DROIDS BEFORE THEY
CAN FIRE.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

THE BRIDGE IS A COCOPHONY OF ALARMS. NUTE AND RUNE WATCH OWO-1 ON THE
VIEWSCREEN.

OWO-1 : NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT...

OWO-1 IS SUDDENLY CUT IN HALF IN MID-SENTENCE. RUNE GIVES NUTE A WORRIED
LOOK.

NUTE : WHAT IN BLAZES IS GOING ON DOWN THERE?
RUNE : HAVE YOU EVER ENCOUNTERED A JEDI KNIGHT BEFORE, SIR?
NUTE : WELL, NOT EXACTLY, BUT I DON'T...(PANICKED) SEAL OFF THE BRIDGE.
RUNE : THAT WON'T BE ENOUGH, SIR.

THE DOORS TO THE BRIDGE SLAM SHUT.

NUTE : I WANT DESTROYER DROIDS UP HERE AT ONCE!!!
RUNE : WE WILL NOT SURVIVE THIS.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

QUI-GON CUTS SEVERAL BATTLE DROIDS IN HALF, CREATING A SHOWER OF SPARKS AND
METAL PARTS. OBI-WAN RAISES HIS HAND, SENDING SEVERAL BATTLE DROIDS
CRASHING INTO THE WALL.

QUI-GON MAKES HIS WAY TO THE BRIDGE DOOR AND BEGINS TO CUT THROUGH IT.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

THE CREW IS VERY NERVOUS AS SPARKS START FLYING AROUND THE BRIDGE DOOR.
QUI-GON AND OBI-WAN ARE ON THE VIEW SCREEN.

NUTE : CLOSE THE BLAST DOORS!!!

THE HUGE, VERY THICK BLAST DOOR SLAMS SHUT, FOLLOWED BY A SECOND DOOR, THEN
A THIRD. THERE IS A HISSING SOUND AS THE HUGE DOORS SEAL SHUT. QUI-GON TABS
THE DOOR WITH HIS SWORD. THE SCREEN GOES BLACK AS A RED SPOT APPEARS IN THE
CENTER OF THE BLAST DOOR.

RUNE : ...THEY'RE STILL COMING THROUGH!

ON THE DOOR, CHUNKS OF MOLTEN METAL BEGIN TO DROP AWAY.

NUTE : IMPOSSIBLE!! THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!!
RUNE : WHERE ARE THOSE DESTROYER DROIDS?!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

TEN UGLY DESTROYER WHEEL DROIDS ROLL DOWN THE HALLWAY AT FULL SPEED. JUST
BEFORE THEY GET TO THE BRIDGE AREA, THEY STOP AND TRANSFORM INTO THEIR
BATTLE CONFIGURATION. QUI-GON CAN'T SEE THEM BUT SENSES THEIR PRESENCE.

QUI-GON : DESTROYER DROIDS!
OBI-WAN : OFFHAND, I'D SAY THIS MISSION IS PAST THE NEGOTIAION STAGE.

THE WHEEL DROIDS, LED BY P-59, RUSH THE ENTRY AREA FROM THREE HALLWAYS,
BLASTING AWAY WITH THEIR LASER GUNS. THEY STOP FIRING AND STAND IN A
SEMI-CIRCLE AS THE SMOKE CLEARS. OBI-WAN AND QUI-GON ARE NOWHERE TO BE
SEEN.

P-59 : SWITCH TO BIO...THERE THEY ARE!

THE JEDI MATERIALIZE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALLWAY AND DASH THROUGH THE
DOORWAY THAT SLAMS SHUT. THE WHEEL DROIDS BLAST AWAY AT THE TWO JEDI WITH
THEIR LASER SWORDS.

OBI-WAN : THEY HAVE SHIELD GENERATORS!
QUI-GON : IT'S A STANDOFF! LET'S GO!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE AND RUNE STAND ON THE BRIDGE, WATCHING THE VIEW SCREEN AS THE WHEEL
DROIDS' POV SPEEDS TO THE DOORWAY.

RUNE : WE HAVE THEM ON THE RUN, SIR...THEY'RE NO MATCH FOR DESTROYER
DROIDS.
TEY HOW : SIR, THEY'VE GONE UP THE VENTILATION SHAFT.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY

QUI-GON AND OBI-WAN APPEAR AT A LARGE VENT IN A GIANT HANGER BAY. THEY ARE
CAREFUL NOT TO BE SEEN. THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS ARE LOADING ONTO LANDING
CRAFT.

QUI-GON : BATTLE DROIDS.
OBI-WAN : IT'S AN INVISIBLE ARMY.
QUI-GON : IT'S AN ODD PLAY FOR THE TRADE FEDERATION. WE'VE GOT TO WARN THE
NABOO AND CONTACT CHANCELLOR VALORUM. LET'S SPLIT UP. STOW ABOARD SEPARATE
SHIPS AND MEET DOWN ON THE PLANET.
OBI-WAN : YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING, MASTER. THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE
SHORT.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW RECIEVES A TRANSMISSION.

TEY HOW : SIR, A TRANSMISSION FROM THE PLANET.
RUNE : IT'S QUEEN AMIDALA HERSELF.
NUTE : AT LAST WE'RE GETTING RESULTS.

ON THE VIEW SCREEN, QUEEN AMIDALA APPEARS IN HER THRONE ROOM. WEARING HER
ELABORATE HEADDRESS AND ROBES, SHE SITS, SURROUNDED BY THE GOVERNING
COUNCIL AND FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, AND SACHE.

NUTE : (CONT'D) AGAIN YOU COME BEFORE ME, YOUR HIGHNESS. THE FEDERATION IS
PLEASED.
AMIDALA : YOU WILL NOT BE PLEASED WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY,
VICEROY...YOUR TRADE BOYCOTT OF OUR PLANET HAS ENDED.

NUTE SMIRKS AT RUNE.

NUTE : I WAS NOT AWARE OF SUCH A FAILURE.
AMIDALA : I HAVE WORD THAT THE SENATE IS FINALLY VOTING ON THIS BLOCKADE OF
YOURS.
NUTE : I TAKE IT YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME. I WONDER WHY THEY BOTHER TO VOTE.
AMIDALA : ENOUGH OF THIS PRETENSE, VICEROY! I'M AWARE THE CHANCELLOR'S
AMBASSADORS ARE WITH YOU NOW, AND THAT YOU HAVE BEENCOMMANDED TO REACH A
SETTLEMENT.
NUTE : I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ANY AMBASSADORS...YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

AMIDALA, SURPRISED AT HIS REACTION, STUDIES HIM CAREFULLY.

AMIDALA : BEWARE, VICEROY....THE FEDERATION IS GOING TOO FAR THIS TIME.
NUTE : YOUR HIGHNESS, WE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF
THE SENATE. YOU ASSUME TOO MUCH.
AMIDALA : WE WILL SEE.

THE QUEEN FADES OFF, AND THE VIEW SCREEN GOES BLACK.

RUNE : SHE'S RIGHT, THE SENATE WILL NEVER....
NUTE : IT'S TOO LATE NOW.
RUNE : DO YOU THINK SHE SUSPECTS AN ATTACK?
NUTE : I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE MUST MOVE QUICKLY TO DISRUPT ALL COMMUNICATIONS
DOWN THERE.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM

THE QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE AND HER GOVERNOR, SIO BIBBLE, STAND BEFORE A

PALPATINE : ...HOW COULD THAT BE TRUE? I HAVE ASSURANCES FROM THE
CHANCELLOR...HIS AMBASSAODRS DID ARRIVE. IT MUST BE
THE...GET...NEGOTIATE...

THE HOLOGRAM OF PALPATIONE SPUTTERS AND FADES AWAY.

AMIDALA : SENATOR PALPATINE?!? (TURNS TO PANAKA) WHAT'S HAPPENING?

CAPTAIN PANAKA TURNS TO HIS SARGEANT

CAPT. PANAKA : CHECK THE TRANSMISSION GENERATORS...
BIBBLE : A MALFUNCTION?
CAPT. PANAKA : IT COULD BE THE FEDERATION JAMMING US. YOUR HIGHNESS.
BIBBLE : A COMMUNICATIONS DISRUPTION CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING. INVASION.
AMIDALA : DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS, GOVERNOR. THE FEDERATION WOULD NOT
DARE GO THAT FAR.
CAPT. PANAKA : THE SENATE WOULD REVOKE THEIR TRADE FRANCHISE, AND THEY'D BE
FINISHED.
AMIDALA : WE MUST CONTINUE TO RELY ON NEGOTIATION.
BIBBLE : NEGOTIATION? WE'VE LOST ALL COMMUNICATIONS!...AND WHERE ATRE THE
CHANCELLORS AMBASSADORS? HOW CAN WE NEGOTIATE? WE MUST PREPARE TO DEFEND
OURSELVES.
CAPT. PANAKA : THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION, YOUR HIGHNESS. OUR SECURITY

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT

THREE LANDING CRAFT SLOWLY DESCEND THROUGH THE CLOUD COVER OF THE
PERPETUALLY GRAY TWILIGHT SIDE OF THE PLANET. ONE BY ONE, THE FEDERATION
WARSHIPS LAND IN THE EERIE SWAMP.
OBI-WAN'S HEAD EMERGES FROM THE MUD OF A SHALLOW LAKE. FOR IN THE

NUTE : EXCELLENT.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON RUNS THROUGH THE STRANGE LANDSCAPE, GLANCING BACK TO SEE THE
MONSTROUS TROOP TRANSPORTS, EMERGING FROM THE MIST. ANIMALS BEGIN TO RUN
PAST HIM IN A PANIC.
AN ODD, FROG-LIKE GUNGAN, JAR JAR INKS, SQUATS HOLDING A CLAM HE HAS
RETRIEVED FROM THE MURKY SWAMP. THE SHELL POPS OPEN. JAR JAR'S GRETA TONGUE
SNAPS OUT AND GRABS THE CLAM, SWALLOWING IT IN ONE GULP.
JAR JAR LOOKS UP AND SEES QUI-GON AND THE OTHER CREATURES RUNNING LIKE THE
WIND TOWARD HIM. ONE OF THE HUGE MTT'S BEARS DOWN ON THE JEDI LIKE A
CHARGING LOCOMOTIVE. JAR JAR STANDS TRANSFIXED, STILL HOLDING THE CLAM
SHELL IN ONE HAND.

JAR JAR : OH, NOOOOOOOOOO!

JAR JAR DROPS THE SHELL AND GRABS ONTO QUI-GON AS HE PASSES. THE JEDI IS
CAUGHT BY SURPRISE.

JAR JAR : (CONT'D) HEY, HELP ME! HELP ME!!
QUI-GON : LET GO!

THE MACHINE IS ABOUT TP CRUSH THEM AS QUI-GON DRAGS JAR JAR BEHIND HIM.
JUST AS THE TRANSPORT IS ABOUT TO HIT THEM, QUI-GON DROPS, AND JAR JAR GOES
SPLAT INTO THE MUD WITH HIM. THE TRANSPORT RACES OVERHEAD.
QUI-GON AND JAR JAR PULL THEMSELVES OUT OF THE MUD. THEY STAND WATCHING THE
WAR MACHINE DISSAPEAR INTO THE MIST. JAR JAR GRABS QUI-GON AND HUGS HIM.

JAR JAR : OYI, MOOIE-MOOIE! I LUV YOUS!

THE FROG-LIKE CREATURE KISSES THE JEDI.

QUI-GON : ARE YOU BRAINLESS? YOU ALMOST GOT US KILLED!
JAR JAR : I SPAKE.

QUI-GON THROWS JAR JAR INTO THE MUD.

QUI-GON : STAY DOWN!

HIS HEAD POPS UP.

THE TWO TROOPS FIRE LASER BOLTS AT OBI-WAN. QUI-GON DEFLECTS THE BOLTS
BACK, AND THE STAPS BLOW UP. ONE-TWO. OBI-WAN IS EXHAUSTED AND TRIES TO
CATCH HIS BREATH.

OBI-WAN : SORRY, MASTER, THE WATER FRIED MY WEAPON.

OBI-WAN PULLS OUT HIS BURNT LASER SWORD HANDLE. QUI-GON INSPECTS IT, AS JAR
JAR PULLS HIMSELF OUT OF THE MUD.

QUI-GON : YOU FORGOT TO TURN YOUR POWER OFF AGAIN, DIDN'T YOU?

OBI-WAN NODS SHEEPLISHLY.

QUI-GON : (CONT'D) IT WON'T TAKE LONG TO RECHARGE, BUT THIS IS A LESSON I

OBI-WAN : YES, MASTER.

JAR JAR : (CONT'D) MY WARNING YOUS. GUNGANS NO LIKEN OUTLAUNDERS. DON'T
EXPICT A WERN WELCOME.
OBI-WAN : DON'T WORRY, THIS HAS NOT BEEN OUR DAY FOR WARM WELCOMES.

WATER.
BREATH MASKS ON, QUI-GON AND OBI-WAN WADE IN AFTER HIM.

EXT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER

QUI-GON AND OBI-WAN SWIM BEHIND JAR JAR, WHO IS VERY MUCH AT HOME IN THE
WATER. DOWN THEY SWIM INTO MURKY DEPTHS. IN THE DISTANCE THE GLOW OF OTOH
GUNGA, AN UNDERWATER CITY MADE UP OF LARGE BUBBLES, BECOMES MORE DISTINCT.
THEY APPROACH THE STRANGE, ART NOUVEAU HABITAT. JAR JAR SWIMS MAGICALLY
THROUGH ONE OF THE BUBBLE MEMBRANES, WHICH SEALS BEHIND HIM. OBI-WAN AND
QUI-GON FOLLOW.

QUI-GON : FULL SPEED AHEAD.

INSTEAD OF FULL AHEAD, JAR JAR JAMS THE CONTROLS INTO REVERSE. THE SUB
FLIES INTO THE MOUTH OF THE CREATURE.

JAR JAR : OOOOPS.
OBI-WAN : GIVE ME THE CONTROLS.

OBI-WAN TAKES OVER THE CONTROLS AND THE OPEE SEA KILLER INSTANTLY RELEASES
THE SUB FROM ITS MOUTH.

JAR JAR : WESA FREE!

AS THE SUB ZOOMS AWAY THEY SEE A LARGER SET OF JAWS, MUNCHING ON THE
HAPLESS KILLER. THE JAWS BELONG TO THE INCREDIBLE SANDO AQUA MONSTER. THE

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

SPARKS ARE FLYING, AND WATER IS LEAKING INTO THE CABIN. THE SOUND OF THE

THE LARGE COLO CLAW FISH IS SURPRISED AND REARS BACK. THE SUB TURNS AROUND
AND SPEEDS AWAY.

JAR JAR : (CONT'D) WESA IN TROUBLE NOW??
QUI-GON : RELAX.

QUI-GON PUTS HIS HAND ON JAR JAR'S SHOULDER. JAR JAR RELAXES INTO A COMA.

OBI-WAN : YOU OVERDID IT.

THE COLO CLAW FISH LEAPS AFTER THE FLEEING SUB AS IT SHOOTS OUT OF THE
TUNNEL AND INTO THE WAITING JAWS OF THE SANDO AQUA MONSTER.

OBI-WAN (CONT'D) THIS IS NOT GOOD!

JAR JAR REGAINS CONSCIOUSNESS.
JAR JAR : WESA DEAD YET?? OIE BOIE!

JAR JAR'S EYES BULGE, AND HE FAINTS AGAIN. THE SUB NARROWLY AVOIDS THE
DEADLY TEETH OF THE AQUA MONSTER. THE COLO CLAW FISH CHASING THEM ISN'T SO
LUCKY. IT IS MUNCHED IN HALF BY THE LARGER PREDATOR. THE LITTLE SUB SLIPS
AWAY.

EXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY

PARADISE. BILLOWING CLOUDS FRAME A ROMANTIC BODY OF WATER. THERE IS A LOUD
RUSH OF BUBBLES, AND A SMALL SUB BOBS TO THE SURFACE.
THE CURRENT IN THE ESTUARY BEGINS TO PULL THE SUB BACKWARD INTO A FAST
MOVING RIVER. OBI-WAN SWITCHES OFF THE TWO REMAINING BUBBLE CANOPIES.
QUI-GON STANDS UP TO LOOK AROUND. JAR JAR LETS OUT A SIGH OF RELIEF.

JAR JAR : WESA SAFE NOW.
QUI-GON : GET THIS THING STARTED.
JAR JAR : DISSEN BERRY GOOD. HEY?
OBI-WAN : WHAT IS IT?

JAR JAR LOOKS BACK TO WHERE THEY'RE DRIFTING. HE SEES THEY ARE HEADED FOR A
HUGE WATERFALL.

JAR JAR : WHAT!!?? OIE BOIE!

OBI-WAN TRIES TO START THE ENGINE. THE LONG PROPS BEHIND THE SUB SLOWLY
BEGIN TO ROTATE. OBI-WAN STRUGGLES UNTIL FINALLY, A FEW FEET SHORT OF THE
WATERFALL, THE SUB STARTS AND IS ABLE TO GENERATE ENOUGH POWER TO STOP
DRIFTING BACKWARD IN THE POWERFUL CURRENT. THE SUB SLOWLY MOVES FORWARD. IN
THE BACKGROUND, QUI-GON TAKES A CABLE OUT OF HIS BELT. THE ENGINE COUGHS
AND DIES. THEY START DRIFTING BACKWARD AGAIN. JAR JAR PANICS.

JAR JAR : (CONT'D) IYIIYI, WESA DIE'N HERE, HEY!

QUI-GON SHOOTS THE THIN CABLE, AND IT WRAPS ITSELF AROUND A RAILING ON THE
SHORE. THE SUB PULLS THE CABLE TAUT, AND THE LITTLE CRAFT HANGS
PRECARIOUSLY OVER THE EDGE OF THE WATERFALL.

QUI-GON : COME ON...

OBI-WAN CLIMBS OUT OF THE SUB AND PULLS HIMSELF ALONG THE CABLE. QUI-GON
STARTS IN AFTER HIM.

QUI-GON : (CONT'D) COME ON, JAR JAR.
JAR JAR : NO! TOO SCARY!
OBI-WAN : GET UP HERE!
JAR JAR : NO A MIGHTY NO!

JAR JAR LOOKS BACK AND SEES HE IS HANGING OVER THE WATERFALL.

JAR JAR : (CONT'D) OIE BOIE...MESA COMEN. MESA COMEN!

JAR JAR STARTS TO CLIMB OUT OF THE SUB. OBI-WAN IS ON SHORE AND HELPS TO
PULL QUI-GON OUT OF THE WATER.

OBI-WAN : THAT WAS CLOSE.
BATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) DROP YOUR WEAPONS!

THE TWO JEDI TURN AROUND TO SEE A BATTLE DROID STANDING IN FRONT OF THEM.
JAR JAR CLIMBS UP ON SHORE BETWEEN THE JEDI.

BATTLE DROID 3B3 : I SAID DROP YOUR WEAPONS

QUI-GON IGNITES HIS LASER SWORD, AND IN A BRIEF FLASH, THE DROID IS CUT
DOWN BY THE JEDI. A STRAY LASER BOLT HITS THE CABLE AND THE SUB BREAKS
LOSE, CRASHING DOWN THE WATERFALL.
THE JEDI MOVE ON. JAR JAR RELUCTANTLY FOLLOWS AND LOOKS BACK AT THE MESS.

ALSO CUT DOWN BY THE JEDIS' FLASHING LIGHTSABRES UNTIL THERE IS ONLY THE
DROID SERGEANT LEFT. THE SERGEANT STARTS TO RUN BUT IS PULLED BACK TO
QUI-GON BY THE FORCE, UNTIL FINALLY HE IS DISPATCHED BY THE JEDI.

JAR JAR : YOUSA GUYS BOMBAD!

QUEEN AMIDALA AND THE OTHERS ARE AMAZED. JAR JAR IS GETTING USED TO THIS.
THEY MOVE BETWEEN TWO BUILDINGS.

QUI-GON : YOUR HIGHNESS, WE ARE THE AMBASSADORS, FOR THE SUPREME
CHANCELLOR.
BIBBLE : YOUR NEGOTIATIONS SEEM TO HAVE FAILED, AMBASSADOR.
QUI-GON : THE NEGOTIATIONS NEVER TOOK PLACE. YOUR HIGHNESS, WE MUST MAKE

DROIDS. ALARMS CAN BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE.

CAPT. PANAKA : THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM.
QUI-GON : THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM. (TO AMIDALA) YOUR HIGHNESS, UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES, ISUGGEST YOU COME TO CORUSCANT WITH US.
AMIDALA : THANK YOU, AMBASSADOR, BUT MY PLACE IS HERE WITH MY PEOPLE.
QUI-GON : THEY WILL KILL YOU IF YOU STAY.
BIBBLE : THEY WOULDN'T DARE.
CAPT. PANAKA : THEY NEED HER TO SIGN A TREATY TO MAKE THIS INVASION OF
THEIRS LEGAL. THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO KILL HER.
QUI-GON : THE SITUATION HERE IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS. THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE
BEHIND ALL THIS, YOUR HIGHNESS. THERE IS NO LOGIC IN THE FEDERATION'S MOVE
HERE. MY FEELINGS TELL ME THEY WILL DESTROY YOU.
BIBBLE : PLEASE, YOUR HIGHNESS, RECONSIDER. OUR ONLY HOPE IS FOR THE SENATE
TO SIDE WITH US... SENATOR PALPATINE WILL NEED YOUR HELP.
CAPT. PANAKA : GETTING PAST THEIR BLOCKADE IS IMPOSSIBLE, YOUR HIGHNESS.
ANY ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE WILL BE DANGEROUS.
BIBBLE : YOUR HIGHNESS, I WILL STAY HERE AND DO WHAT I CAN...THEY WILL HAVE
TO RETAIN THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNORS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CONTROL. BUT YOU
MUST LEAVE...

THE QUEEN TURNS TO PADME AND EIRTAE.

AMIDALA : EITHER CHOICE PRESENTS A GREAT RISK...TO ALL OF US...
PADME : WE ARE BRAVE, YOUR HIGHNESS.
QUI-GON : IF YOU ARE TO LEAVE, YOUR HIGHNESS, IT MUST BE NOW.

CAREFUL, GOVERNOR.

CAPT. PANAKA : WE NEED TO FREE THOSE PILOTS.

CAPTAIN PANAKA POINTS TO TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, AND PILOTS HELD IN A
CORNER BY SIX BATTLE DROIDS.

OBI-WAN : I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT. OBI-WAN HEADS TOWARD THE GROUP OF
CAPTURED PILOTS.

QUI-GON AND THE QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, AND THE REST OF THE GROUP
APPROACH THE GUARDS AT THE RAMP OF THE NABOO CRAFT.

GUARD DROID : WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
QUI-GON : I'M AMBASSADOR FOR THE SUPREME CHANCELLOR, AND I'M TAKING THOSE
PEOPLE TO CORUSCANT.
DROID GUARD : YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

THE DROID GUARD DRAWS HIS WEAPON, BUT BEFORE ANY OF THE DROIDS CAN FIRE,
THEY ARE CUT DOWN. OTHER GUARDS RUN TO THEIR AID. OBI-WAN ATTACKS THE
GUARDS AROUND THE PILOTS. QUI-GON STANDS, FIGHTING OFF DROIDS AS THE OTHERS
RUSH ON BOARD THE SPACECRAFT. OBI-WAN, THE FREED PILOTS (INCLUDING RIC

POWER DRIVE. DEFLECTOR SHIELD UP, AT MAXIMUM.

THE LONE BLUE DROID FINISHES HIS REPAIRS AND GOES BACK INTO THE SHIP. THE
NABOO SPACECRAFT RACES AWAY FROM THE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP.

RIC OLIE : THERE'S NOT ENOUGH POWER TO GET US TO CORUSCANT...THE HYPERDRIVE
IS LEAKING.
QUI-GON : WE'LL HAVE TO LAND SOMEWHERE TO REFUEL AND REPAIR THE SHIP.

QUI-GON STUDIES A STAR CHART ON A MONITOR.

OBI-WAN : HERE, MASTER. TATOOINE... IT'S SMALL, OUT OF THE WAY, POOR... THE
TRADE FEDERATION HAS NO PRESENCE THERE.
CAPT. PANAKA : HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?
QUI-GON : IT'S CONTROLLED BY THE HUTTS...
CAPT. PANAKA : THE HUTTS??
OBI-WAN : IT'S RISKY...BUT THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE.
CAPT. PANAKA : YOU CAN'T TAKE HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THERE! THE HUTTS ARE
GANGSTERS... IF THEY DISCOVERED HER...
QUI-GON : ...IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT THAN IF WE LANDED ON A SYSTEM
CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERATION...EXCEPT THE HUTTS AREN'T LOOKING FOR HER,
WHICH GIVES US AN ADVANTAGE.

OTHER SETTLEMENTS...
DARTH SIDIOUS : DESTROY ALL HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS,
VICEROY...SLOWLY...QUIETLY. AND QUEEN AMIDALA, HAS SHE SIGNED THE TREATY?

THE LITTLE BLUE DROID LETS OUT A SERIES OF BLEEPS.CAPTAIN PANAKA LEANS OVER
AND SCRAPES SOME DIRT OFF OF THE SIDE OF THE DROID AND READ THE NUMBER:

CAPT. PANAKA : R2-D2, YOUR HIGHNESS.
AMIDALA : THANK YOU, ARTOO DETOO. YOU HAVE PROVEN TO BE VERY LOYAL...PADME!

PADME BOWS BEFORE THE QUEEN.

AMIDALA : (CONT'D) CLEAN THIS DROID UP THE BEST YOU CAN. IT DESERVES OUR
GRATITUDE...(TO PANAKA) CONTINUE, CAPTAIN.

CAPTAIN PANAKA LOOKS NERVOUSLY TO OBI-WAN AND QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : YOR HIGHNESS, WE ARE HEADING FOR A REMOTE PLANET CALLED TATOOINE.
IT IS A SYSTEM FAR BEYOND THE REACH OF THE TRADE FEDERATION. THERE WE WILL
BE ABLE TO MAKE NEEDED REPAIRS, THEN TRAVEL ON TO CORUSCANT.
CAPTAIN PANAKA : YOUR HIGHNESS, TATOOINE IS VERY DANGEROUS. IT'S CONTROLLED
BY AN ALLIANCE OF GANGS CALLED THE HUTTS. I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE JEDI ON

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, AND ARTOO ENTER THE DINGY JUNK SHOP AND ARE

QUI-GON : I NEED PARTS FOR A J-TYPE 327 NUBIAN.
WATTO : AH YES, AH YES. NUBIAN. WE HAVE LOTS OF THAT. WHAT KINDA JUNK?
(SUBTITLED) PEEDENKEL! NABA DEE UNKO (BOY, GET IN HERE! NOW!)
QUI-GON : MY DROID HERE HAS A READOUT OF WHAT I NEED.

A DISHEVELED BOY, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, RUNS IN FROM THE JUNK YARD. HE IS ABOUT
NINE YEARS OLD, VERY DIRTY, AND DRESSED IN RAGS. WATTO RAISES A HAND, AND
ANAKIN FLINCHES.

WATTO : (SUBTITLED) COONA TEE-TOCKY MALIA? (WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?)
ANAKIN : (SUBTITLED) MEL TASSA CHO-PASSA... (I WAS CLEANING THE BIN LIKE

SOOOO, LET ME TAKE- A THEE OUT BACK. NI YOU'LL FIND WHAT YOU NEED.

ARTOO AND QUI-GON FOLLOW WATTO TOWARD THE JUNK YARD, LEAVING JAR JAR WITH
PADME AND THE YOUNG BOY ANAKIN. JAR JAR PICKS UP A GIZMO, TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT ITS PURPOSE. QUI-GON TAKES THE PART OUT OF HIS HAND AND PUTS IT BACK.

QUI-GON : DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

JAR JAR MAKES A RUDE FACE TO QUI-GON'S BACK AND STICKS OUT HIS LONG TONGUE.
ANAKIN SITS ON THE COUNTER, PRETENDING TO CLEAN A PART, STARING AT PADME.
SHE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREAURE HE HAS EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFE. PADME IS A
LITTLE EMBARRASSED BY HIS STARE, BUT SHE MUSTERS UP AN AMUSED SMILE.
FINALLY, HE GETS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK.

ANAKIN : ARE YOU AN ANGEL?
PADME : WHAT?
ANAKIN : AN ANGEL. I'VE HEARD THE DEEP SPACE PILOTS TALK ABOUT THEM. THEY
LIVE ON THE MOONS OF IEGO I THIMK. THEY ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURES IN
THE UNIVERSE. THEY ARE GOOD AND KIND, AND SO PRETTY THEY MAKE EVEN THE MOST
HARDENED SPICE PIRATE CRY.

PADME LOOKS AT HIM, NOT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY. PADME : I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
ANGELS.

ANAKIN : YOU MUST BE ONE...MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT.
PADME : YOU'RE A FUNNY LITTLE BOY. HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH?
ANAKIN : SINCE I WAS VERY LITTLE, THREE, I THINK. MY MOM AND I WERE SOLD TO
GARDULLA THE HUTT, BUT SHE LOST US, BETTING ON THE PODRACES, TO WATTO,
WHO'S A LOT BETTER MASTER THAN GARDULLA, I THINK.
PADME : YOU'RE...A SLAVE?

ANAKIN LOOKS AT PADME DEFIANTLY.

ANAKIN : I AM A PERSON! MY NAME IS ANAKIN.
PADME : I'M SORRY. I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND. (LOOKING AROUND)THIS IS A
STRANGE WORLD TO ME.

ANAKIN STUDIES HER INTENTLY.

ANAKIN : YOU ARE A STRANGE GIRL TO ME.

JAR JAR PUSHES THE NOSE ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE DROID, AND IT
INSTANTLY COMES TO LIFE, GROWS LEGS AND ARMS, AND STARTS MARCHING AROUND,
KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING. JAR JAR HOLD ON BUT CAN'T STOP IT.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) HIT THE NOSE!

JAR JAR HITS THE NOSE, AND THE DROID COLLAPSES BACK INTO ITS ORIGINAL
STATE. ANAKIN AND PADME LAUGH. ANAKIN WATCHES PADME STRAIGHTEN HER HAIR.

EXT. WATTO'S JUNK YARD - BEHIND SHOP - DAY

WATTO READS A SMALL PORTABLE MONITOR HE IS HOLDING. HE STANDS BEFORE A
HYPERDRIVE.

WATTO : REPUBLIC CREDITS?!? REPUBLIC CREDITS ARE NO GOOD OUT HERE. I NEED
SOMETHING MORE REAL...
QUI-GON : I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE. (RAISING HIS HAND) BUT CREDITS WILL
DO FINE.
WATTO : NO THEY WON'TA. QUI-GON, USING HIS MIND POWER, WAVES HIS HAND
AGAIN.
QUI-GON : CREDITS WILL DO FINE.
WATTO : NO, THEY WON'TA. WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE SOME KINDA JEDI, WAVING YOUR
HAND AROUND LIKE THAT? I'M A TOYDARIAN. MIND TRICKS DON'TA WORK ON ME-ONLY
MONEY. NO MONEY, NO PARTS! NO DEAL! AND NO ONE ELSE HAS A T-14 HYPERDRIVE,
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

JAR JAR PULLS A PART OUT OF A STACK OF PARTS TO INSPECT IT, AND THEY ALL
COME TUMBLIMG DOWN. HE STRUGGLES TO CATCH THEM, ONLY TO KNOCK MORE DOWN.
ANAKIN AND PADME ARE OBLIVIOUS.

ANAKIN : ...WOULDN'T HAVE LASTED LONG IF I WEREN'T SO GOOD AT FIXING
THINGS. I'M MAKING MY OWN DROID...

QUI-GON HURRIES INTO THE SHOP, FOLLOWED BY ARTOO. QUI-GON : WE'RE LEAVING.
JAR JAR FOLLOWS QUI-GON. PADME GIVES ANAKIN A LOVING LOOK.

PADME : I'M GLAD I MET YOU,....AH...
ANAKIN : ...ANAKIN.
PADME : ANAKIN.
ANAKIN : ANAKIN SKYWALKER.
PADME : PADME NABERRIE.

PADME TURNS, AND ANAKIN LOOKS SAD AS HE WATCHES HER LEAVE.

ANAKIN : I'M GLAD I MET YOU TOO.

WATTO ENTERS THE JUNK YARD, SHAKING HIS HEAD.

WATTO : (SUBTITLED) OOTMIANS! TINKA ME CHASA HOPOE MA BOOTY NA NOLIA.

ANAKIN LETS OUT A "YIPEE" AND RUNS OUT THE BACK.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY

QUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, AND PADME HAVE FOUND A QUIET SPOT BETWEEN TWO
BUILDINGS. THE BUSY STREET BEYOND IS FILLED WITH DANGEROUS LOOKING
CREATURES. QUI-GON IS TALKING ON HIS COM-LINK, WHILE JAR JAR NERVOUSLY
WATCHES THE STREET. OBI-WAN IS IN THE MAIN HOLD OF THE NABOO CRAFT.

QUI-GON : ...OBI-WAN, YOU'RE SURE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING OF VALUE LEFT ON
BOARD?
OBI-WAN : (V.O) A FEW CONTAINERS OF SUPPLIES, THE QUEEN'S WARDROBE, MAYBE.
NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO BARTER WITH. NOT IN THE AMMOUNTS YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT.
QUI-GON : ALL RIGHT. ANOTHER SOLUTION WILL PRESENT ITSELF. I'LL CHECK BACK.

QUI-GON PUTS HIS COMLINK AWAY AND STARTS OUT INTO THE MAIN STREET. JAR JAR
GRABS HIS ARM.

JAR JAR : NOAH GAIN...DA BEINGS HEREABOUTS CAWAZY. WESA BE ROBBED UN
CRUNCHED.
QUI-GON : NOT LIKELY. WE HAVE NOTHING OF VALUE, THAT'S OUR PROBLEM.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY

QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, AND ARTOO MOVE OUT INTO THE STREET. JAR JAR IS
WALKING BEHIND THE OTHERS. THEY WALK BY AN OUTDOOR CAFE FILLED WITH A ROUGH
GANG OF ALIENS, ONE OF WHICH IS ESPECIALLY UGLY, SEBULBA, A SPIDER-LIKE
CREATURE. JAR JAR STOPS FOR A MOMENT IN FRONT OF A STALL SELLING DEAD FROGS
HANGING ON A WIRE. HE LOOKS AROUND TO SEE IF ANYONE IS LOOKNIG, THEN STICKS
OUT HIS TONGUE, AND GETS HOLD OF ONE, PULLING IT INTO HIS MOUTH.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE FROG IS TIED TIGHTLY TO THE WIRE. THE VENDOR SUDDENLY
APPEARS.

VENDOR : HEY, THAT WILL BE SEVEN TRUGUTS!!

JAR JAR OPENS HIS MOUTH IN SURPRISE, AND THE FROG SNAPS AWAY, RICOCHETS
AROUND THE MARKET, AND LANDS IN SEBULBA'S SOUP, SPLASHING HIM. AS JAR JAR
MOVES AWAY FROM THE VENDOR, SEBULBA JUMPS UP ON THE TABLE AND GRABS THE
HAPLESS GUNGAN.

SEBULBA : (SUBTITLED) CHUBA!! (YOU!!) JAR JAR : WHO, MESA?? SEBULBA :
(SUBTITLED) NI CHUBA NA?? (IS THIS YOURS??)

SEBULBA HOLDS THE FROG UP TO THE GUNGAN THREATENINGLY. SEVERAL OTHER
CREATURES START TO GATHER. SEBULBA SHOVES JAR JAR TO THE GROUND. THE GUNGAN
DESPERATELY TRIES TO SCRAMBLE TO SAFETY.

JAR JAR : (TO HIMSELF) WHY MESA ALWAYS DA ONE??
ANAKIN : (V.O) BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID.

JAR JAR TURNS TO SEE ANAKNI PUSHING HIS WAY NEXT TO HIM. THE BOY STANDS UP
TO SEBULBA IN A VERY SELF-ASSURED WAY.

ANAKIN : (SUBTITLED) CHESS KO, SEBULBA...COO WOLPA TOONEY RANA. (CAREFUL,
SEBULBA...THIS ONE'S VERY CONNECTED.)

SEBULBA STOPS HIS ASSAULT ON JAR JAR AND TURNS TO ANAKIN.

SEBULBA : (SUBTITLED) TOONEY RANA NU PRATTA DUNKO, SHAG. (CONNECTED?? WHADA

ANAKIN : (SUBTITLED) OH DA HUTT...CHA PORKO OOTMAN GEESA...ME TEESA RODDA

SEBULBA TURNS AWAY.

ANAKIN : (SUBTITLED) EH, CHEE BANA DO MULLEE RA. (YEAH, IT'D BE A PITY IF
YOU HAD TO PAY FOR ME.)

QUI-GON, PADME AND ARTOO ARRIVE.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) HI! YOUR BUDDY HERE WAS ABOUT TO BE TURNED INTO ORANGE
GOO. HE PICKED A FIGHT WITH A DUG. AN ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS DUG CALLED
SEBULBA.
JAR JAR : NOSIR, NOSIR. MESA HATE CRUNCHEN. DAT'S DA LAST TING MESA WANTEN.
QUI-GON : NEVERTHELESS, THE BOY IS RIGHT...YOU WERE HEADING FOR TROUBLE.
THANK YOU, MY YOUNG FRIEND.

PADME LOOKS AT ANAKINB AND SMILES; HE SMILES BACK. THEY START WALKING DOWN
THE CROWDED STREET.

JAR JAR : MESA DOEN NUTTEN!
ANAKIN : FEAR ATTRACTS THE FEARFUL. HE WAS TRYING TO OVERCOME HIS FEAR BY
SQUASHING YOU...BE LESS AFRAID.
PADME : AND THAT WORKS FOR YOU.
ANAKIN : TO A POINT. (HE SMILES)

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

OBI-WAN STANDS IN FRONT OF THE NABOO SPACECRAFT AS THE WIND PICKS UP AND
BEGINS TO WHIP AT HIS ROBE. CAPTAIN PANAKA EXITS THE SHIP AND JOINS HIM.

OBI-WAN : THIS STORM'S GOING TO SLOW THEM DOWN.

ANAKIN : GUESS WHAT? I'VE FOUND THAT COOLING UNIT I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR.
IT'S PRETTY BEAT UP, BUT I'LL HAVE IT FIXED UP FOR YOU IN NO TIME, I
PROMISE.
JIRA : YOU'RE A FINE BOY, ANNIE.
ANAKIN : I'LL TAKE FOUR PALLIES TODAY. (TO PADME) YOU'LL LIKE THESE...

ANAKIN REACHES IN HIS POCKET AND COMES UP WITH THREE COINS. HE DROPS ONE.
QUI-GON PICKS IT UP, REVEALING FOR A MOMENT, HIS LIGHTSABRE.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) WHOOPS, I THOUGHT I HAD MORE...MAKE THGAT THREE, I'M NOT
HUNGRY.

THE WIND PICKS UP. SHOP OWNERS ARE STARTING TO CLOSE UP THEIR SHOPS AS JIRA
GIVES THEM THEIR PALLIES.

JIRA : GRACIOUS, MY BONES ARE ACHING...STORM'S COMING ON, ANNIE. YOU'D
BETTER GET HOME QUICK.
ANAKIN : (TO QUI-GON) DO YOU HAVE SHELTER?
QUI-GON : WE'LL HED BACK TO OUR SHIP.
ANAKIN : IS IT FAR?
PADME : ON THE OUTSKIRTS.
ANAKIN : YOU'LL NEVER REACH THE OUTSKIRTS IN TIME...SANDSTORMS ARE VERY,
VERY DANGEROUS. COME WITH ME. HURRY!

SHMI : OH, MY!! ANNIE, WHAT'S THIS?
ANAKIN : THESE ARE MY FRIENDS, MOM. THIS IS PADME, AND...GEE, I DON'T KNOW
ANY OF YOUR NAMES.
QUI-GON : I'M QUI-GON JINN, AND THIS IS JAR JAR BINKS. ARTOO LETS OUT A
LITTLE BEEP.
PADME : ...AND OUR DROID, ARTOO-DETOO.
ANAKIN : I'M BUILDING A DROID. YOU WANNA SEE?
SHMI : ANAKIN! WHY ARE THEY HERE?
ANAKIN : A SANDSTORM, MOM. LISTEN.

THE WIND HOWLS OUTSIDE.

QUI-GON : YOUR SON WAS KIND ENOUGH TO OFFER US SHELTER.
ANAKIN : COME ON! LET ME SHOW YOU THREEPIO!

ANAKIN LEADS PADME INTO THE OTHER ROOM. ARTOO FOLLOWS, BEEPING ALL THE WAY.
QUI-GON TAKES FIVE SMALL CAPSULES FROM HIS UTILITY BELT AND HANDS THEM TO
SHMI.

QUI-GON : I HAVE ENOUGH FOOD FOR A MEAL.
SHMI : OH, TANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M SORRY IF I WAS ABRUPT. I'LL
NEVER GET USED TO ANAKIN'S SURPRISES.
QUI-GON : HE'S A VERY SPECIAL BOY. SHMI LOOKS AT HIM AS IF HE'S DISCOVERED
A SECRET.
SHMI : YES, I KNOW.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY

ANAKIN SHOWS OFF HIS ANDROID, WHICH IS LYING ON HIS WORKBENCH. THERE IS ONE
EYE IN THE HEAD; THE BODY, ARMS, AND LEGS HAVE NO OUTER COVERINGS.

ANAKIN : ISN'T HE GREAT?! HE'S NOT FINISHED YET.
PADME : HE'S WONDERFUL!
ANAKIN : YOU REALL LIKE HIM? HE'S A PROTOCOL DROID...TO HELP MOM. WATCH!

ANAKIN PUSHES A SWITCH, AND THE DROID SITS UP. ANAKIN RUSHES AROUND, GRABS
AN EYE AND PUTS IT IN ONE OF THE SOCKETS.

THREEPIO : HOW DO YOU DO, I AM SEE-THREEPIO, HUMAN CYBORG RELATIONS. HOW
MIGHT I SERVE YOU?
PADME : HE'S PERFECT.
ANAKIN : WHEN THE STORM IS OVER, YOU CAN SEE MY RACER. I'M BUILDING A
PODRACER!

PADME SMILES AT HIS ENTHUSIASM. ARTOO LETS OUT A FLURRY OF BEEPS AND
WHISTLES.

THREEPIO : I BEG YOUR PARDON....WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M NAKED?

ARTOO BEEPS

THREEPIO : (CONT'D) MY PARTS ARE SHOWING? OH, MY GOODNESS. HOW
EMBARRASSING!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, AND OBI-WAN WATCH A VERY BAD TRANSMISSION OF A SIO
BIBBLE HOLOGRAM.

BIBBLE : ...CUT OFF ALL FOOD SUPPLIES UNTIL YOU RETURN...THE DEATH TOLL IS
CATASTROPHIC...WE MUST BOW TO THEIR WISHES, YOUR HIGHNESS...PLEASE TELL US
WHAT TO DO! IF YOU CAN HEAR US, YOUR HIGHNESS, YOU MUST CONTACT ME...

AMIDALA LOOKS UPSET...ALMOST NERVOUS.

OBI-WAN : IT'S A TRICK. SEND NO REPLY... SEND NO TRANSMISSION OF ANY KIND.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON LISTENS TO HIS COMLINK. OBI-WAN IS IN THE COCKPIT.

OBI-WAN : ...THE QUEEN IS UPSET...BUT ABSOLUTLY NO REPLY WAS SENT.
QUI-GON : IT SOUNDS LIKE BAIT TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTION TRACE.
OBI-WAN : WHAT IF IT IS TRUE AND THE PEOPLE ARE DYING?
QUI-GON : EITHER WAY, WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

EXT. CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS AND DARTH MAUL LOOK OUT OVER THE VAST CITY.

DARTH MAUL : TATOOINE IS SPARSELY POPULATED. IF THE TRACE WAS CORRECT, I
WILL FIND THEM QUICKLY, MASTER.
DARTH SIDIOUS : MOVE AGAINST THE JEDI FIRST...YOU WILL THEN HAVE NO
DIFFICULTY TAKING THE QUEEN BACK TO NABOO, WHERE SHE WILL SIGN THE TREATY.
DARTH MAUL : AT LAST WE WILL REVEAL OURSELVES TO THE JEDI. AT LAST WE WILL
HAVE REVENGE.
DARTH SIDIOUS : YOU HAVE BEEN WELL TRAINED, MY YOUNG APPRENTICE, THEY WILL
BE NO MATCH FOR YOU. IT IS TOO LATE FOR THEM TO STOP US NOW. EVERYTHING IS
GOING AS PLANNED. THE REPUBLIC WILL SOON BE IN MY COMMAND.

THE HOLOGRAM OF DARTH MAUL FADES OFF AS DARTH SIDIOUS LOOKS OUT OVER THE
CITY. EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY

THE GIANT SANDSTORM ENGULFS THE TOWN, INCLUDING THE NABOO SPACESHIP ON THE
OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY CENTER, WHERE WATTO'S SHIP IS; AND THE SLAVE
QUARTERS, WHERE DRIFTS OF SAND BEGIN BUILDING UP AGAINST ANAKIN'S HOUSE.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, AND PADME ARE SEATED AROUND A MAKESHIFT
TABLE, HAVING DINNER AS THE WIND HOWLS OUTSIDE.
JAR JAR SLURPS HIS SOUP RATHER LOUDLY. EVERYONE LOOKS AT HIM. HE TURNS A
LITTLE BRIGHTER RED.

SHMI : ALL SLAVES HAVE TRANSMITTERS PLACED INSIDE THEIR BODIES SOMEWHERE.
ANAKIN : I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A SCANNER TO TRY AND LOCATE THEM, BUT NO
LUCK.
SHMI : ANY ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE...
ANAKIN : ...AND THEY BLOW YOU UP...POOF!

PADME AND JAR JAR ARE HORRIFIED.

JAR JAR : HOW WUDE.
PADME : I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE IS STILL SLAVERY IN THE GALAXY. THE
REPUBLIC'S ANTI-SLAVERY LAWS...
SHMI : THE REPUBLIC DOESN'T EXIST OUT HERE...WE MUST SURVIVE ON OUR OWN.

AN AWKWARD SILENCE. ANAKIN ATTEMPTS TO END THE EMBARRASSMENT.

ANAKIN : HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A PODRACE?

PADME SHAKES HER HEAD NO. SHE NOTICES THE CONCERN OF SHMI. JAR JAR SNATCHES
SOME FOOD FROM A BOWL AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE WITH HIS TONGUE.
QUI-GON GIVES HIM A DIRTY LOOK.

QUI-GON : THEY HAVE PODRACING ON MALASTARE. VERY FAST, VERY DANGEROUS.
ANAKIN : I'M THE ONLY HUMAN WHO CAN DO IT.

SHMI LOOKS ASKANCE AT HER SON.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) MOM, WHAT? I'M NOT BRAGGING. IT'S TRUE. WATTO SAYS HE'S
NEVER HEARD OF A HUMAN DOING IT.
QUI-GON : YOU MUST HAVE JEDI REFLEXES IF YOU RACE PODS.

ANAKIN SMILES. JAR JAR ATTEMPTS TO SNARE ANOTHER BIT OF FOOD FROM THE BOWL
WITH HIS TONGUE, BUT QUI-GON, IN A FLASH, GRABS IT BETWEEN HIS THUMB AND
FOREFINGER. JAR JAR IS STARTLED.

QUI-GON : (CONT'D) DON'T DO THAT AGAIN.

JAR JAR TRIES TO ACKNOWLEDGE WITH SOME SILLY MUMBLING. QUI-GON LETS GO OF
THE TONGUE, AND IT SNAPS BACK INTO JAR JAR'S MOUTH.

ANAKIN : I...I WAS WONDERING...SOMETHING...
QUI-GON : WHAT?
ANAKIN : WELL, AHHH...YOU'RE A JEDI KNIGHT, AREN'T YOU?
QUI-GON : WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?
ANAKIN : I SAW YOUR LASER SWORD. ONLY JEDI CARRY THAT KIND OF WEAPON.

QUI-GON LEANS BACK AND SLOWLY SMILES.

QUI-GON : PERHAPS I KILLED A JEDI AND STOLE IT FROM HIM.
ANAKIN : I DON'T THINK SO... NO ONE CAN KILL A JEDI KNIGHT.
QUI-GON : I WISH THAT WERE SO...
ANAKIN. I HAD A DREAM I WAS A JEDI. I CAME BACK HERE AND FREED ALL THE
SLAVES...HAVE YOU COME TO FREE US?
QUI-GON : NO, I'M AFRAID NOT...
ANAKIN : I THINK YOU HAVE...WHY ELSE WOULD YOU BE HERE?

QUI-GON THINKS FOR A MOMENT.

QUI-GON : I CAN SEE THERE'S NO FOOLING YOU...(LEANS FORWARD) YOU MUSTN'T
LET ANYONE KNOW ABOUT US...WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO CORUSCANT, THE CENTRAL
SYSTEM IN THE REPUBLIC, ON A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION, AND IT MUST BE KEPT
SECRET.
ANAKIN : CORUSCANT...WOW...HOW DID YOU END UP HERE IN THE OUTER RIM?
PADME : OUR SHIP WAS DAMAGED, AND WE'RE STRANDED HERE UNTIL WE CAN REPAIR
IT.
ANAKIN : I CAN HELP! I CAN FIX ANYTHING!
QUI-GON : I BELIEVE YOU CAN, BUT OUR FIRST JOB IS TO AQUIRE THE PARTS WE
NEED...
JAR JAR : WIT NO-NUTTEN MULA TO TRADE.
PADME : THESE JUNK DEALERS MUST HAVE A WEAKNESS OF SOME KIND.
SHMI : GAMBLING. EVERYTHING HERE REVOLVES AROUND BETTING ON THOSE AWFUL
RACES.
QUI-GON : PODRACING... GREED CAN BE A POWERFUL ALLY.. IF IT'S USED
PROPERLY.
ANAKIN : I'VE BUILT A RACER! IT'S THE FASTEST EVER...THERE'S A BIG RACE
TOMORROW, ON BOONTA EVE. YOU COULD ENTER MY POD. IT'S ALL BUT FINISHED...
SHMI : ANAKIN, SETTLE DOWN. WATTO WON'T LET YOU...
ANAKIN : WATTO DOESN'T KNOW I'VE BUILT IT. (TO QUI-GON) YOU COULD MAKE HIM
THINK IT'S YOUR'S, AND YOU COULD GET HIM TO LET ME PILOT IT FOR YOU.

QUI-GON LOOKS TO SHMI. SHE IS UPSET.

SHMI : I DON'T WANT YOU TO RACE, ANNIE...IT'S AWFUL. I DIE EVERY TIME WATTO
MAKES YOU DO IT.

ANAKIN : BUT MOM, I LOVE IT...AND THEY NEED HELP...THEY'RE IN TROUBLE. THE
PRIZE MONEY WOULD MORE THAN PAY FOR THE PARTS THEY NEED. JAR JAR : WESA INA
PITTY BAD GOO.
GUI-GON : YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT. IS THERE ANYONE FRIENDLY TO THE REPUBLIC WHO
MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP US?

SHMI SHAKES HER HEAD NO.

ANAKIN : WE HAVE TO HELP THEM, MOM...YOU SAID THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN
THE UNIVERSE IS NO ONE HELPS EACH OTHER...
SHMI : ANAKIN, DON'T...

JAR JAR BELCHES. THERE IS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT AS THEY EAT.

PADME : I'M SURE QUI-GON DOESN'T WANT TO PUT YOUR SON IN DANGER. WE WILL
FIND ANOTHER WAY...
SHMI : NO, ANNIE'S RIGHT, THERE IS NO OTHER WAY... I MAY NOT LIKE IT, BUT
HE CAN HELP YOU...HE WAS MEANT TO HELP YOU.
ANAKIN : IS THAT A YES? THAT IS A YES!

THE STORM CONTINUES TO RAGE OUTSIDE THE SLAVE HOVEL.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

THE STORM HAS PASSED. VENDORS AND STREET PEOPLE CLEAN UP THE MESS AND
REBUILD THEIR FOOD STALLS. JAR JAR SITS ON A BOX IN FRONT OF WATTO'S PARTS
SHOP, WATCHING ALL THE ACTIVITY WITH GROWING NERVOUSNESS. ARTOO IS STANDING
NEXT TO HIM. PADME STOPS QUI-GON AS HE IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE SHOP.

PADME : ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? TRUSTING OUR FATE TO A BOY WE HARDLY KNOW.
THE QUEEN WILL NOT APPROVE.
QUI-GON : THE QUEEN DOES NOT NEED TO KNOW.
PADME : WELL, I DON'T APPROVE.

QUI-GON TURNS AND STARTS INTO THE SHOP.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

WATTO AND ANAKIN ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION IN HUTTESE.

WATTO : PATTA GO BOLLA!
ANKAIN : NO BATTA!
WATTO : PEDUNKY. MAA KEE CHEELYA.
ANAKIN : BAYNO, BAYNO!

QUI-GON WALKS IN, AND WATTO AND ANAKIN JOIN HIM.

WATTO : THE BOY TELLS ME YOU WANTA SPONSER HI INSA RACE. YOU CAN'T AFFORD
PARTS. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS? NOT ON REPUBLIC CREDITS, I THINK. (HE LAUGHS)
QUI-GON : MY SHIP WILL BE THE ENTRY FEE.

QUI-GON PULLS A SMALL OBJECT THAT LOOKS LIKE A WATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET, AND
A HOLOGRAM OF THE NABOO SPACECRAFT APPEARS ABOUT A FOOT LONG IN FRONT OF
WATTO. HE STUDIES IT.

WATTO : NOT BAD...NOT BAD...A NUBIAN.
QUI-GON : IT'S IN GOOD ORDER, EXCEPT FOR THE PARTS WE NEED.
WATTO : ...BUT WHAT WOULD THE BOY RIDE? HE SMASHED UP MY POD IN THE LAST
RACE. IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO FIX IT.

ANAKIN IS EMBARRASSED AND STEPS FORWARD.

ANAKIN : AHHHH....IT WASN'T MY FAULT REALLY...SEBULBA FLASHED ME WITH HIS
VENT PORTS. I ACTUALLY SAVED THE POD...MOSTLY.
WATTO : (LAUGHING) THAT YOU DID. THE BOY IS GOOD, NO DOUBTS THERE.
QUI-GON : I HAVE...ACQUIRED A POD IN A GAME OF CHANCE. "THE FASTEST EVER
BUILT."
WATTO : I HOPE YOU DIDN'T KILL ANYONE I KNOW FOR IT. (LAUGHS) SO, YOU
SUPPLY THE POD AND THE ENTRY FEE; I SUPPLY THE BOY. WE SPLIT THE WINNINGS
FIFTY-FIFTY, I THINK.
QUI-GON : FIFTY-FIFTY!?! IF IT'S GOING TO BE FIFTY-FIFTY, I SUGGEST YOU
FRONT THE CASH FOR THE ENTRY. IF WE WIN, YOU KEEP ALL THE WINNINGS, MINUS
THE COST OF THE PARTS I NEED...IF WE LOSE, YOU KEEP MY SHIP.

WATTO THINKS ABOUT THIS. ANAKIN TRIES NOT TO BE NERVOUS.

QUI-GON : (CONT'D) EITHER WAY, YOU WIN.
WATTO : (SUBTITLED) DEAL! YO BANA PEE HO-TAH, MEEDEE YA. (YOUR FRIEND IS A
FOLLISH ONE, METHINKS.)

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - TATOOINE DESERT - DAY

OBI-WAN STANDS OUTSIDE THE NABOO SPACECRAFT, SPEAKING INTO HIS COMLINK.
QUI-GON IS ON THE BACK PORCH OF THE HOVEL.

OBI-WAN : WHAT IF THIS PLAN FAILS, MASTER? WE COULD BE STUCK HERE FOR A
LONG TIME.
QUI-GON : (V.O) A SHIP WITHOUT A POWER SUPPLY WILL NOT GET US ANYWHERE, AND
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BOY...

EXT MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

QUI-GON PUTS THE COMLINK AWAY AS SHMI COMES ONTO THE PORCH

PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, AND ARTOO WORK ON THE ENGINES OF THE PODRACER IN
THE COURTYARD BELOW.

QUI-GON : YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOUR SON. HE GIVES WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT OF
REWARD.
SHMI : HE KNOWS NOTHING OF GREED. HE HAS...
QUI-GON : HE HAS SPECIAL POWERS.
SHMI : YES...
QUI-GON : HE CAN SEE THINGS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN. THAT'S WHY HE APPEARS TO
HAVE SUCH QUICK REFLEXES. IT IS A JEDI TRAIT.
SHMI : HE DESERVES BETTER THAN A SLAVE'S LIFE.
QUI-GON : THE FORCE IS UNUSALLY STRONG WITH HIM, THAT MUCH IS CLEAR. WHO
WAS HIS FATHER?
SHMI : THERE WAS NO FATHER, THAT I KNOW OF...I CARRIED HIM, I GAVE HIM
BIRTH...I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED. CAN YOU HELP HIM?
QUI-GON : I'M AFRAID NOT. HAD HE BEEN BORN IN THE REPUBLIC, WE WOULD HAVE
IDENTIFIED HIM EARLY, AND HE WOULD HAVE BECOME JEDI, NO DOUBT...HE HAS THE
WAY. BUT IT'S TOO LATE FOR HIM NOW, HE'S TOO OLD.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - DAY

KITSTER (A YOUNG BOY ABOUT ANAKIN'S AGE), SEEK (A BOY OF TEN), AMEE (A GIRL
OF SIX), AND WALD (A GREEDO TYPE, SIX YEARS OLD) JOIN ANAKIN, JAR JAR,
ARTOO, AND PADME SECURING SOME WIRING.

ANAKIN : PADME AND JAR JAR, THIS IS MY FRIEND KITSTER, AND SEEK, AMEE, AND
WALD.

ALL WHISTLE, HOOT, AND SPEAK A GREETING.

KITSTER : WOW, A REAL ASTRO DROID...HOW'D YOU GET SO LUCKY?
ANAKIN : THIS ISN'T THE HALF OF IT. I'M ENTERED IN THE BOONTA RACE
TOMORROW!
KITSTER : WHAT? WITH THIS??
WALD : (SUBTITLED) ANNIE, JESKO NA JOKA. 9YOU ARE SUCH A JOKE, ANNIE.)
AMEE : YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT THING FOR YEARS. IT'S NEVER GOING TO
RUN.
SEEK : COME ON, LET'S GO PLAY BALL. KEEP IT UP, ANNIE, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
BUG SQUASH.

SEEK, WALD, AND AMEE TAKE OFF, LAUGHING. JAR JAR IS FIDDLING WITH ONE OF
THE ENERGY BINDER PLATES.

ANAKIN : HEY! JAR JAR! STAY AWAY FROM THOSE ENERGY BINDERS...
JAR JAR : WHO, MESA?
ANAKIN : IF YOUR HAND GETS CAUGHT IN THAT BEAM, IT WILL GO NUMB FOR HOURS.

JAR JAR PEEKS AT THE ENERGY PLATE; IT MAKES A LITTLE ELECTRONIC POP, ZAPS
HIM IN THE MOUTH AND JUMPS BACK. JAR JAR TRIES TO SAY SOMETHING, BUT HIS
MOUTH IS NUMB AND HIS WORDS ARE GARBLED.

JAR JAR : OUCH-DATS MUY BIGO OUCHO. (GIBBERISH)
KITSTER : BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS THING WILL RUN.
ANAKIN : IT WILL.

QUI-GON APPROACHES THE GROUP AND GIVES ANAKIN A SMALL BATTERY. JAR JAR GETS
HIS HAND CAUGHT IN THE AFTERBURNER AND TRIES TO TELL ANAKIN, BUT CAN'T GET
WORDS OUT THAT MAKE SENSE.

QUI-GON : I THINK IT'S TIME WE FOUND OUT. USE THIS POWER CHARGE. ANAKIN :
YES, SIR!!

ANAKIN JUMPS INTO THE LITTLE CAPSULE BEHIND THE TWO GIANT ENGINES. HE PUTS
THE POWER PACK BACK INTO THE DASHBOARD. EVERYONE BACKS AWAY, EXCEPT FOR JAR
JAR WHO CALLS FOR HELP. FINALLY PADME FREES HIM AND THE ENGINES IGNITE WITH
A ROAR. EVERYONE CHEERS.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

SHMI, WATCHING FROM THE PORCH, SMILES SADLY.

EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT

ANAKIN SITS ON THE BALCONY RAIL OF HIS HOVEL AS QUI-GON TENDS TO A CUT. THE
BOY LEANS BACK TO LOOK AT THE VAST BLANKET OF STARS IN THE SKY.

QUI-GON : SIT STILL, ANNIE. LET ME CLEAN THIS CUT.
ANAKIN : THERE ARE SO MANY! DO THEY ALL HAVE A SYSTEM OF PLANETS?
QUI-GON : MOST OF THEM.
ANAKIN : HAS ANYONE BEEN TO THEM ALL?
QU-IG0N : (LAUGHS) NOT LIKELY.
ANAKIN : I WANT TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO SEE THEM ALL... OUCH!

QUI-GON WIPES A PATCH OF BLOOD OFF ANAKIN'S ARM.

QUI-GON : THERE, GOOD AS NEW...

SHMI YELLS FROM INSIDE THE HOVEL.

SHMI : (O.S.) ANNIE, BEDTIME!

QUI-GON SCRAPES ANAKIN'S BLOOD ONTO A COMLINK CHIP.

ANAKIN : WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
QUI-GON : CHECKING YOUR BLOOD FOR INFECTIONS.
ANAKIN : I'VE NEVER SEEN...
SHMI : (O.S.) ANNIE! I'M NOT GOIUNG TO TELL YOU AGAIN!
QUI-GON : GO ON, YOU HAVE A BIG DAY TOMORROW. (BEAT) GOODNIGHT.

ANAKIN ROLLS HIS EYES AND RUNS INTO THE HOVEL. QUI-GON TAKES THE BLOOD
STAINED CHIP AND INSERTS IT INTO THE COMLINK, THEN CALLS OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : (CONT'D) OBI-WAN...
OBI-WAN : YES, MASTER.
QUI-GON : MAKE AN ANALYSIS OF THIS BLOOD SAMPLE I'M SENDING YOU.
OBI-WAN : WAIT A MINUTE...
QUI-GON : I NEED A MIDI-CHLORIAN COUNT.
OBI-WAN : ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT IT.
QUI-GON : WHAT ARE YOUR READINGS?
OBI-WAN : SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG WITH THE TRANSMISSION.
QUI-GON : HERE'S A SIGNAL CHECK.
OBI-WAN : STRANGE. THE TRANSMISSION SEEMS TO BE IN GOOD ORDER, BUT THE
READING'S OFF THE CHART...OVER TWENTY THOUSAND.
QUI-GON : (ALMOST TO HIMSELF) THAT'S IT THEN.
OBI-WAN : EVEN MASTER YODA DOESN'T HAVE A MIDI-CHLORIAN COUNT THAT HIGH!
QUI-GON : NO JEDI HAS.
OBI-WAN : WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
QUI-GON : I'M NOT SURE.

THE JEDI KNIGHT LOOKS UP AND SEES SHMI IN THE DOORWAY WATCHING HIM.
EMBARRASSED, SHE GOES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN WHILE QUI-GON PONDERS THE
SITUATION.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - NIGHT

THE SINISTER LOOKING SITH SPACECRAFT LANDS ON TOP OF A DESERT MESA AT DUS,
SCATTERING A HERD OF BANTHAS. DARTH MAUL WALKS TO THE EDGE OF THE MESA AND
STUDIES THE LANDSCAPE WITH A PAIR OF ELECTROBINOCULARS. HE PICKS OUT THE
LIGHTS OF THREE DIFFERENT CITIES IN THE DISTANCE, THEN PUSHES BUTTONS ON
HIS ELECTRONIC ARMBAND.

SIX FOOTBALL-SIZED PROBE DROIDS FLOAT OUT OF THE SHIP AND HEAD OFF IN THREE
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TOWARD THE CITIES.

DARTH MAUL STANDS ON THE MESA AND WATCHES THEM THROUGH HIS
ELECTROBINOCULARS.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - SUNRISE

PADME EXITS THE HOVEL.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - SUNRISE

AS THE TWIN SUNS RISE, ARTOO IS BUSY PAINTING THE RACING POD. ANAKIN IS
ASLEEP. PADME PASSES ARTOO.

PADME : I HOPE YOU'RE ABOUT FINISHED.

ARTOO WHISTLES A POSITIVE REPLY. PADME SEES KITSTER RIDING TOWARD THEM ON
AN EOPIE, A STRANGE CAMEL-LILE CREATURE. HE IS LEADING A SECOND EOPIE
BEHIND HIM. PADME GOES OVER TO ANAKIN. HE LOOKS VERY VULNERABLE AS HE
SLEEPS. SHE WATCHES HIM, THEN TOUCHES HIM ON THE CHEEK. ANAKIN WAKES UP,
YAWNS, AND LOOKS AT HER, A LITTLE PUZZLED.

ANAKIN : YOU WERE IN MY DREAM...YOU WERE LEADING A HUGE ARMY INTO BATTLE.
PADME : I HOPE NOT; I HATE FIGHTING. YOUR MOTHER WANTS YOU TO COME IN AND
CLEAN UP. WE HAVE TO LEAVE SOON. ANAKIN STANDS UP AND STRETCHES JUST AS
KITSTER ARRIVES.

ANAKIN : HOOK 'EM UP, KITSTER. (TO PADME) I WON'T BE LONG. WHERE'S QUI-GON?

PADME : HE AND JAR JAR LEFT ALREADY. THEY'RE WITH WATTO AT THE ARENA.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

RACE CREWS MILL ABOUT OUTSIDE THE MAIN HANGER.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

THE HANGER IS A LARGE BUILDING WITH A DOZEN OR SO PODRACERS BEING READIED
FOR THE RACE. ALIEN CREWS AND PILOTS RUSH ABOUT, MAKING LAST MINUTE FIXES
ON THEIR VEHICLES. WATTO, QUI-GON, AND JAR JAR WALK THROUGH THE ACTIVITY.

WATTO : ...I WANT TO SEE YOUR SPACESHIP THE MOMENT THE RACE IS OVER.
QUI-GON : PATIENC, MY BLUE FRIEND. YOU'LL HAVE YOUR WINNINGS BEFORE THE
SUNS SET, AND WE'LL BE FAR AWAY FROM HERE.
WATTO : NOT IF YOUR SHIP BELONGS TO ME, I THINK...I WARN YOU, NO FUNNY
BUSINESS.
QUI-GON : YOU DON'T THINK ANAKIN WILL WIN?

WATTO STOPS BEFORE AN ORANGE RACER. SITTING TO ONE SIDE, HAVING HIS
SHOULDERS AND NECK MASSAGED BY TWIN YOBANAS, IS SEBULBA.

WATTO : DON'T GET ME WRONGO. I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN THE BOY. HE'S A CREDIT
TO YOUR RACE, BUT SEBULBA THERE IS GOING TO WIN, I THINK.
QUI-GON : WHY?
WATTO : HE ALWAYS WINS. (LAUGHS) I'M BETTING HEAVILY ON SEBULBA.
QUI-GON : I'LL TAKE THAT BET.
WATTO : (SUDDENLY STOPS LAUGHING) WHAT??!! WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
QUI-GON : I'LL WAGER MY NEW RACING POD AGAINST...SAY...THE BOY AND HIS
MOTHER.
WATTO : A POD FOR SLAVES. I DON'T THINK SO...WELL, POERHAPS. JUST ONE...THE
MOTHER, MAYBE...THE BOY ISN'T FOR SALE.
QUI-GON : THE BOY IS SMALL, HE CAN'T BE WORTH MUCH.

WATTO SHAKES HIS HEAD.

QUI-GON : (CONT'D) FOR THE FASTEST POD EVER BUILT?!

WATTO SHAKES HIS HEAD AGAIN.

QUI-GON : (CONT'D) BOTH, OR NO BET.
WATTO : NO POD'S WORTH TWO SLAVES...NOT BY A LONG SHOT...ONE SLAVE OR
NOTHING.
QUI-GON : THE BOY, THEN...

WATTO PULLS OUT A SMALL CUBE FROM HIS POCKET.

WATTO : WE'LL LET FATE DECIDE. BLUE IT'S THE BOY, RED HIS MOTHER...

WATTO TOSSES THE CUBE DOWN. QUI-GON LIFTS HIS HAND SLIGHTLY; IT TURNS BLUE.
QUI-GON SMILES. WATTO IS ANGRY.

WATTO : (CONT'D) YOU WON THE SMALL TOSS, OUTLANDER, BOU YOU WON'T WIN THE
RACE, SO...IT MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE.

ANAKIN AND PADME ENTER THE HANGER ON ONE OF THE EOPIES, PULLING AN ENGINE.
KITSTER, ON THE OTHER EOPIE, IS PULLING ANOTHER ENGINE. WITH THREEPIO
WALKING ALONGSIDE, ARTOO TRUNDLES BEHIND, PULLING THE POD WITH SHMI SITTING
ON IT. WATTO PASSES ANAKIN AS HE LEAVES.

WATTO : (CONT'D) (SUBTITLED) BONAPA KEESA PATEESO, O WANNA MEETEE CHOBODD.
(BETTER STOP YOUR FRIENDS BETTING, OR I'LL END UP OWNING HIM, TOO.)

WATTO WALKS OFF, LAUGHING.

ANAKIN : WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THAT?

QUI-GON : I'LL TELL YOU LATER.

ARTOO BEEPS AT THREEPIO.

THREEPIO : OH MY! SPACE TRAVEL SOUNDS RATHER PERILOUS.

ARTOO EMITS A SERIES OF BEEPS.

THREEPIO : I CAN ASSURE YOU THEY WILL NEVER GET ME ONTO ONE OF THOSE
DREADFUL STARSHIPS!
KITSTER : (TO ANAKIN) THIS IS SO WIZARD! I'M SURE YOU'LL DO IT THIS TIME,
ANNIE.
PADME : DO WHAT?
KITSTER : FINISH THE RACE, OF COURSE!
PADME : YOU'VE NEVER WON A RACE?
ANAKIN : WELL...NOT EXACTLY...
PADME : NOT EVEN FINISHED?!

ANAKN LOOKS SHEEPISH.

ANAKIN : ...BUT KITSTER'S RIGHT, I WILL THIS TIME.
QUI-GON : OF COURSE YOU WILL.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

KITSTER ATTACHES THE GIANT ENGINS TO ANAKIN'S POD WITH A LONG CABLE. SHMI
GIVES ANAKIN A BIG HUG AND KISS. SHE LOOKS HIM RIGHT IN THE EYE.

SHMI : BE SAFE.
ANAKIN : I WILL, MOM. I PROMISE.

SHE LEAVES AS ANAKIN CHECKS THE CABLE HITCHES.

JABBA : ...MAWHONIC TUTA HOK, TEEMTO PAGALIES TUTA MOONUS MANDEL, ANAKIN
SKYWALKER TUTA TATOONINE....

THE CROWD YELLS. ANAKIN WAVES TO THE CROWD, AS JABBA CONTINUES WITH HIS
INTRODUCTIONS. SEBULBA MOVES OVER TO ONE OF ANAKIN'S ENGINES. KITSTER AND
JAR JAR UNHITCH THE EOPIES, AND KITSTER LEADS THEM AWAY. ARTOO BEEPS THAT
EVERYTHING IS OK. JAR JAR PATS ANAKIN ON THE BACK.

JAR JAR : DIS BERRY LOONY, ANNIE. MAY DA GUDS BE KIND, MESA PALO.

PADME COMES UP AND GIVES ANAKIN A LITTLE KISS ON THE CHEEEK. SEBULBA BANGS
ON A PART PROTRUDING FROM ANAKIN'S ENGINE. HE LOOKS AROUND TO SEE IF ANYONE
HAS NOTICED.

PADME : YOU CARRY ALL OUR HOPES.
ANAKIN : I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

PADME MOVES AWAY AS SEBULBA EDGES HIS WAY NEXT TO ANAKIN AND GIVES HIM A

WON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS ONE, SLAVE SCUM! YOU'RE BANTHA POODOO.)
ANAKIN : (SUBTITLED) CHA SKRUNDEE DA PAT, SLEEMO. (DON'T COUNT ON IT,
SLIME-BALL.)

ANAKIN LOOKS THE EVIL SEBULBA IN THE EYE WITH A COLD STARE. QUI-GON
APPROACHES, AND SEBULBA BACKS OFF TOWARD HIS RACER.

JABBA : (SUTITLED)...KA BAZZA KUNDEE HODRUDDA! (...LET THE CHALLENGE
BEGIN!)

THE CROWD LETS OUT A LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON HELPS ANAKIN INTO HIS POD. THE BOY
STRAPS HIMSELF INTO THE TINY RACER.

QUI-GON : ARE YOU ALL SET, ANNIE? (ANAKIN NODS) REMEMBER, CONCENTRATE ON
THE MOMENT. FEEL. DON'T THINK. TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS. (HE SMILES) MAY THE
FORCE BE WITH YOU.

QUI-GON STEPS AWAY AS ANAKIN PUTS ON HIS GOGGLES. THE PILOTS FLIP SWITCHES,
AND POWERFUL ENERGY BINDERS SHOOT BETWEEN THE ENGINES. ANAKIN FLIPS A
SWITCH, AND HIS ENGINE STARTS. THE INCREDIBLE ROAR OF HIGH-POWERED ENGINES
IGNITING ECHOES THROUGHOUT THE ARENA. ONE DRIVER, ODY MANDRELL, YELLS AT A
DROID (DUM-4) TO GET AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF HIS ENGINE. THE CROWD IS TENSE.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

THE GIANT POWER-HOUSE ENGINES TORQUE AS THE PILOTS GUN THEM. THE PILOTS
FLIP SWITCHES, AND POERFUL ENERGY BINDERS SHOOT BETWEEN THE ENGINES. ALIENS
CARRYING LARGE FLAGS MOVE OFF THE TRACK. JAR JAR COVERS HIS EYES.

JAR JAR : MESA NO WATCH. DISSEN GANNA BE MESSY!
FODE/BEED : -
A : YA PAWA CULKA DOE RUNDEE! (THE POWER COUPLINGS ARE BEING ACTIVATED)
B : HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE CLEARING THE GRID.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

SHMI LOOKS NERVOUSLY TO QUI-GON AS HE ENTERS A VEIWING PLATFORM. PADME AND
JAR JAR ARE ALREADY ON BOARD. THE PLATFORM RISES LIKE AN ELEVATOR.

SHMI : IS HE NERVOUS?
QUI-GON : HE'S FINE.
PADME : YOU JEDI ARE FAR TOO RECKLESS. THE QUEEN...
QUI-GON : THE QUEEN TRUSTS MY JUDGMENT, YOUNG HANDMAIDEN. YOU SHOULD TOO.
PADME : YOU ASSUME TOO MUCH.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

THE EARTH-POUNDING ROAR OF THE ENGINES REVVING IS DEAFENING.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

JABBA BITES OFF THE HEAD OF A FROG AND SPITS IT AT A GONG, SIGNALING THE
START OF THE RACE.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

ON A BRIDGE OVER THE TRACK, A GREAT GREEN LIGHT AT THE CENTER FLASHES. THE
PODRACERS SHOOT FORWARD WITH A HIGH-PITCHES SCREAM. ANAKIN'S ENGINE FLOODS
AND COUGHS - THEN DIES. ALL THE OTHER PODRACERS EXCEPT ONE SWERVE AROUND
HIM AND DISSAPEAR DOWN THE TRACK. THE SLAVE BOY STRUGGLES TO GET HIS RACER
STARTED. THE TWO-HEADED ANNOUNCER REPORTS.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
A : AN DARE OVV! (AND THEY'RE OFF!)
B : OH...WAIT. LITTLE SKYWALKER HAS STALLED.

PADME AND JAR JAR ARE VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH ANAKIN. QUI-GON PUTS HIS ARM
AROUND A VERY WORRIED SHMI TO COMFORT HER. FINALLY, ANAKIN'S ENGINES
IGNITE. HE ZOOMS AWAY AFTER THE RECEEDING PACK OF COMPETITORS, LEAVING ONE
QUADRA-POD RACER STILL TRYING TO GET STARTED. THE TWO-HEADED ANNOUNCER
DESCRIBES THE RACE AS IT PROGRESSES.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : AND THERE GOES SKYWALKER... HE'LL BE HARD PRESSED TO CATCH UP WITH THE
LEADERS TODAY.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

THE PODRACERS FLY ACROSS THE DESERT. SEBULBA IS RUNNING NECK AND NECK WITH
MAWHONIC. THEY ROUND THE FIRST TURN IN THE TRACK, SIDE BY SIDE. SEBULBA
DRIVES HIS POD INTO HIS RIVAL, FORCING HIM INTO THE WALL OF A LARGE ROCK
FORMATION. MAWHONIC CRASHES IN A SPECTACULAR DISPLAY OF FIRE AND SMOKE.
ANAKIN IS MUCH FASTER THAN THE BACK-END STRAGGLERS AND PASSES THEM EASILY.
ONE OF THE DRIVERS, GASGANO, WON'T LET ANAKIN BY. ANAKIN TRIES TO PASS HIM
ON ONE SIDE AND IS CUT OFF. HE THEN TRIES TO PASS HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE
ANSD IS CUT OFF. AS THEY COME UP ON A CLIFF DROP-OFF, ANAKIN BACKS OFF,
THEN GUNS IT AS GASGANO GOES OVER THE CLIFF. ANAJIN ACCELERATES SO FAST
THAT HE SAILS RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF GASGANO AND SPEEDS AWAY.
FOUR TUSKEN RAIDERS PERCHED ABOVE THE RACE COURSE FIRE THEIR RIFLES AT THE
PODS RACING IN THE CANYON BELOW THEM. ONE SHOT RICOCHETS OFF THE BACK OF
ANAKIN'S POD.

FODE/BEED : -
B : LOOKS LIKE A FEW TUSKEN RIADERS HAVE CAMPE OUT ON THE CANYON DUNE TURN.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

JABBA THE HUTT AND THE CROWD WATCH THE PROGRESS OF THE RACE ON SMALL,
HAND-HELD VIEW SCREENS. JAR JAR IS LOOKING OVER THE SHOULDER OF A STRANGE
ALIEN NAMED FANTA.

JAR JAR : WHERE'S SKYWALKER?

FANTA MOVES THE VIEW SCREEN OUT OF JAR JAR'S VIEW. PADME, SHMI, AND QUI-GON
WATCH ANOTHER SCREEN AND LOOK WORRIED.
ARTOO, DOWN IN THE PITS WITH KITSTER, LETS OUT A WORRIED SIGH. THE DRIVER
OF THE QUADRA-POD LOOKS WORRIED.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

ANAKIN IS POWERING AROUND CORNERS AND OVER HILLS AND CLIFFS, PASSING OTHER
RACERS RIGHT AND LEFT. SEBULBA IS IN THE LEAD. HE IS BEING CHALLENGED BY
ANOTHER RACER, XELBREE.
SEBULBA SLOWS A LITTLE, AND AS XELBREE PULLS ALONGSIDE, HE OPENS A SIDE
VENT ON THE RACER'S ENGINE AND THE EXHAUST STARTS TO CUT THROUGH THE
ALIEN'S ENGINE.
THE BLAST CUTS ALONG THE ENGINE UNTIL FINALLY IT EXPLODES. SEBULBA DEFTLY
VEERS AWAY.
ANAKIN WORKS HIS WAY THROUGH A DENSE MASS OF RACERS AS THEY ZOOM OVER A
DUNE SEA, KICKING UP DUST. HIS POD SHAKES VIOLENTLY AS HE GOES OVER A JUMP.
ONE OF THE PODRACERS, ODY, CATCHES ONE OF HIS ENGINES IN THE SAND, AND THE
WHOLE THING EXPLODES.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

QUI-GON SITS QUIETLY, MEDITATING. PADME AND SHMI SEARCH THE LANDSCAPE FOR
ANY SIGN OF THE RACERS. JAR JAR IS STILL ANNOYING FANTA FOR INFORMATION.
THE CROWD SCREAMS. WATTO IS LAUGHING WITH HIS FRIENDS, CONFIDENT IN
ANAKIN'S DEFEAT.
THE QUADRA-POD ENGINES START JUST AS THE RACERS COME AROUND THE CORNER. THE
DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, PUTS IT IN GEAR, AND THE FOUR ENGINES GO OFF IN ALL
DIRECTIONS, EXPLODING IN A SPECTACULAR DISPLAY. THE POD DROPS TO THE GROUND
AS SEBULBA ENTERS THE ARENA, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY ALL THE OTHER RACERS.
KITSTER STRAINS TO SEE AS ARTOO BEEPS EXCITEDLY. THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUES.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S)
B ; THERE GOES QUADINAROS' POWER COUPLINGS.
A : SEBULBA! KA PA ME CHEESPA WATA! (HERE COMES SEBULBA IN RECORD TIME.)

QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, AND JAR JAR YELL FOR JOY AS ANAKIN PASSES. JAR JAR IS
VERY NERVOUS AND POUNDS ON THE BACK OF HIS ALIEN NEIGHBOR, FANTA. JAR JAR :
WHAT GOOIE-ON?
FANTA : BUG OFF.

LAP TWO. SEBULBA AND THE PACK RACE PAST THE MAIN ARENA. THE CROWD STANDS
AND YELLS AS THE PODRACERS SCREAM OFF INTO THE DISTANCE. QUI-GON AND PADME
LOOK WORRIED.

JAR JAR : HE MUSTA CRASH-UD.
PADME : HERE HE COMES!

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PIT AREA - DAY (FX)

ARTOO LETS OUT AN EXCITED WHISTLE, AS KITSTER YELLS.

THREEPIO : HE HAS TO COMPLETE TWO MORE CIRCUITS? OH DEAR!

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

SURE ENOUGH, COMING AROUND THE BEND IS ANAKIN, QUICKLY GAINING ON THE PACK.
THE TWO-HEADED ANNOUNCER DESCRIBES THE ACTION. THE CROWD GOES WILD.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : IT LOOKS LIKE SKYWALKER IS MOVING UP THROUGH THE FIELD. HE'S IN...
A : STEETH PA NAGOOLA! (SIXTH PLACE, NOT BAD.)

ANAKIN CONTINUES TO GAIN ON THE PACK. TENSION FOR SHMI AND PADME IS
UNBEARABLE.
ODY STOPS IN THE PITS. DROIDS WORK ON HIS ENGINES. DUM-4 STANDS IN FRONT OF
THE ENGINE AND IS SUCKED IN, CAUSING THE ENGINE TO DIE. DUM-4 IS SPIT OUT
THE BACK OF THE ENGINE, VERY BENT UP. THE ENGINE LETS OUT ONE FINAL WHEEZE,
THEN EXPLODES IN A PUFF OF SMOKE.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
A : ODY MANDRELL! COONA WA WUNDA DUNKO! (ODY MANDRELL INTO THE PITS FOR
SOME ATTENTION.)
ODY : DROIDS!

TERTER IS GETTING CLOSE TO SEBULBA, WHO PURPOSELY BREAKS A SMALL PART OFF
HIS POD, SENDING IT INTO TERTER'S ENGINE, CAUSING HIM TO VEER INTO ANAKIN,
AND UNHOOKS ONE OF THE MAIN STRAPS ON ANAKIN'S ENGINES THAT LINKS THE POD
TO HIS ENGINES.
ANAKIN STRUGGLES TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE LITTLE POD. IT WHIPS ABOUT WILDLY.
AS THE POD SWINGS NEAR THE BROKEN ENGINE STRAP, ANAKIN GRABS FOR IT.
FINALLY, HE CATCHES THE STRAP AND MANAGES TO UNHOOK IT TO THE POD.
SEBULBA CUTS THE ENGINE OF OBITOKI WITH HIS SIDE EXHAUST, AND THE RACER
CRASHES WITH A CLOUD OF DUST. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, FLIE INTO THE CLOUD OF
DUST AND CRASHES INTO OBITOKI. ANAKIN ROUNDS A CORNER AND HEADS INTO THE
CLOUD OF SMOKE. HE HITS A PART OF ONE OF THE ENGINES BUT REGAINS CONTROL.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B :AT THE START OF THE THIRD AND FINAL LAP, SEBULBA IS IN THE LEAD, CLOSELY
FOLLOWED BY SKYWALKER...

ANAKIN FINALLY CATCHES UP WITH SEBULBA, AND RUNS NECK AND NECK OVER THE
ROUGH TERRAIN. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, AND PADME ALL SCREAM S ANAKIN COMES
THROUGH THE ARENA. THE LIGHTS IN THE TOWER INDICATE THAT THIS IS THE THIRD
AND LAST LAP. WATTO BEGINS TO WORRY.
SEBULBA USES HIS SIDE EXHAUST PORT TO TRY TO CUT THROUGH ANAKIN'S ENGINES.
ANAKIN MANAGES TO AVOID HAVING HIS ENGINE DISABLED BUT IS FORCED OFF
COURSE.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : SKYWALKER IS FORCED ONTO THE SERVICE RAMP!
A : OH NOAH!

ON A TIGHT CORNER, ANAKIN DIVES TO THE INSIDE AND TAKES THE LEAD.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : AMAZING... A CONTROLLED THRUST AND HE'S BACK ON COURSE! WHAT A MOVE!

SEBULBA IS FURIOUS. HE STAY'S RIGHT ON ANAKIN'S TAIL, CROWDING HIM AND
PUSHING HIM THROUGH THE TURNS.
SEBULBA PUSHES ANAKIN HARDER, AND THE YOUNG BOY HAS A DIFFICULT TIME
KEEPING CONTROL. ONE OF THE PARTS ON ANAKIN'S ENGINES BEGINS TO SHAKE
LOOSE. ANAKIN SEES IT AND SWITCHES OVER TO AN AUXILIARY SYSTEM. WHILE HE IS
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS MANEUVER, SEBULBA RACES PAST HIM.
ANAKIN TRIES TO GET AROUND SEBULBA, TO NO AVAIL. EVERY MOVE ANAKIN MAKES,
SEBULBA IS ABLE TO BLOCK.
FINALLY, ANAKIN FAKES A MOVE INTO THE INSIDE AS HE USUALLY DOES, THEN TRIES
TO GO AROUND SEBULBA ON THE OUTSIDE. THEY RACE SID BY SIDE DOWN THE FINAL
STRETCH OF THE TRACK.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : HE'S CATCHING SEBULBA.
A : INKABUNGA. (INCREDIBLE!)

SEBULBA VEERS TOWARD ANAKIN AND BANGS INTO HIS POD. HE CRASHES INTO ANAKIN
OVER AND OVER. THE YOUNG BOY STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN CONTROL AS THE STEERING
RODS ON THE TWO PODS BECOME HOOKED TOGETHER. SEBULBA LAUGHS AT ANAKIN.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : THAT LITTLE HUMAN BEING IS OUT OF HIS MIND.
A : PUNDA TAH PUNDA! (THEY'RE NECK AND NECK!)
B : THEY'RE SIDE BY SIDE!
A : BONGO DU BONGU! (SHOULDER TO SHOULDER!)

AS THEY HEAD FOR THE FINAL STRETCH, ANAKIN FIGHTS TO UNLOCK THE STEERING
RODS BY TRYING TO PULL AWAY FROM SEBULBA. THE STRAIN ON THE STEERING ROD IS
TREMENDOUS. SUDDENLY, ANAKIN'S STEERING ARM BREAKS, AND HIS POS STARTS
SPINNING.
THE RELEASE OF TENSION SENDS SEBULBA INTO AN ANCIENT STATUE. ONE ENGINE
EXPLODES, THEN THE OTHER. SEBULBA SKIDS THROUGH THE FIRE-BALLS, BLACKENED,
BUT UNHURT. HE SLIDES TO A SMOKING STOP, GETS OUT OF HIS RACER, AND THROWS
WHAT'S LEFT OF A SHIFTER ARM ON THE GROUND. SUDDENLY HE REALIZES HIS PANTS
ARE ON FIRE, AND HE STRUGGLES TO PUT THEM OUT. ANAKIN FLIES THROUGH THE
EXPLOSION AS THE CROWD STANDS, CHERRING. PADME AND JAR JAR JUMP UP AND DOWN
WITH EXCITMENT, PADME SCREAMING FOR JOY. ARTOO AND KITSTER WHISTLE
HYSTERICALLY. QUI-GON AND SHMI SMILE. ANAKIN RACES OVER THE FINISH LINE,
THE WINNER.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCERS BOX - DAY (FX)

THE TWO-HEADED ANNOUNCER EXCITEDLY CALLS THE FINISH.

FODE/BEED : -
B : IT'S SKYWALKER! THE CROWD ARE GOING NUTS! OH AH OH AH (ROCK HEAD IN
TANDEM WITH PARTNER)

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - DAY

AS ANAKIN STOPS THE PODRACER, KISTER TURNS UP, AND THEY EMBRACE. HUNDREDS
OF SPECTATORS JOIN THEM AND PUT ANAKIN ON THEIR SHOULDERS, MARCHING OFF,
CHEERING AND CHANTING. DARTH MAUL'S PROBE DROIDS MOVE THROUGH THE CROWD.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PRIVATE BOX - DAY

SEVERAL ALIENS LEAVE WATTO'S BOX, LAUGHING AND COUNTING THEIR MONEY. WATTO
SEES QUI-GON STANDING IN THE DOORWAY.

WATTO : YOU! YOU SWINDLED ME! YOU KNEW THE BOY WAS GOING TO WIN! SOMEHOW
YOU KNEW IT! I LOST EVERYTHING.

WATTO FLIES UP TO QUI-GON AND PUTS HIS FACE RIGHT UP AGAINST QUI-GON'S.
QUI-GON SIMPLY SMILES.

QUI-GON : WHENEVER YOU GAMBLE, MY FREIND, EVENTUALLY YOU'LL LOSE. BRING THE
PARTS TO THE MAIN HANGER. I'LL COME BY YOUR SHOP LATER SO YOU CAN RELEASE
THE BOY.
WATTO : YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM! IT WASN'T A FAIR BET!
QUI-GON : WOULD YOU LIKE TO DISCUSS IT WITH THE HUTTS...I'M SURE THEY CAN
SETTLE THIS.
WATTO : NO, NO! I WANT NO MORE OF YOUR TRICKS! TAKE HIM!

THE SITH PROBE DROID WATCHES WITH GREAT INTEREST.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

THE MAIN HANGER IS ALMOST DESERTED AS RACERS DEPART.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

JAR JAR GIVES ANAKIN A GREAT HUG, THEN PADME GIVES HIM A HUG, THEN SHMI.

ANAKIN : AH, GEE...ENOUGH OF THIS...
SHMI : IT'S SO WONDERFUL, ANNIE. YOU HAVE BROUGHT HOPE TO THOSE WHO HAVE
NONE. I'M SO VERY PROUD OF YOU...
PADME : WE OWE YOU EVERYTHING.
ANAKIN : JUST FEELING THIS GOOD WAS WORTH IT.

IN THE BACKGROUND, QUI-GON HAS HARNESSED THE EOPIES TO CONTAINERS FULL OF
PARTS.

QUI-GON : PADME. JAR JAR, LET'S GO, WE'VE GOT TO GET THESE PARTS BACK TO
THE SHIP.

THE GROUP WALKS OVER TO QUI-GON AND THE EOPIES.
PADME CLIMBS ON BEHIND QUI-GON. JAR JAR SWINGS UP ONTO THE SECOND EOPIE,
ONLY TO SLWLY SLIDE OFF THE OTHER SIDE. ARTOO WHISTLES. ANAKIN AND SHMI
WAVE AS THEY RIDE OFF.

QUI-GON : (CONT'D) I'LL RETURN THE EOPIES BY MIDDAY.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

ARTOO CRUISES AHEAD OF QUI-GON AND PADME, WHO ARE RIDING ONE OF THE EOPIES;
JAR JAR RIDSES THE OTHER. THEY STOP IN FRONT OF THE SLEEK NABOO SPACECRAFT.
OBI-WAN COMES OUT OF THE SHIP AND JOINS THEM.

QUI-GON : START GETTING THIS HYPERDRIVE GENERATOR INSTALLED. I'M GOING
BACK...SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS. I WON'T BE LONG.
OBI-WAN : WHY DO I SENSE WE'VE PICKED UP ANOTHER PATHETIC LIFE FORM...?
QUI-GON : IT'S THE BOY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING THOSE PARTS.

ON A HILL FAR OVERLOOKING THE NABOO SPACECRAFT, THE SITH PROBE DROID TURNS
AND SPEEDS AWAY.

EXT. TATOOINE - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

ANAKIN AND A GREEDO ARE ROLLING AROUND ON THE FLOOR, FIGHTING. ABOUT A
DOZEN OR SO KIDS ARE STANDING AROUND THEM, YELLING. SUDDENLY, A LONG SHADOW
IS CAST OVER THE TWO BOYS; THEY STOP FIGHTING AND LOOK UP. QUI-GOMN IS
TOWERING ABOVE THEM. KITSTER IS WITH THEM.

QUI-GON : WHAT'S THIS?
ANAKIN : HE SAID I CHEATED.
QUI-GON : DID YOU?
ANAKIN : NO!
QUI-GON : DO YOU STILL THINK HE CHEATED?
GREEDO : YES.
QUI-GON : WELL, ANNIE. YOU KNOW THE TRUTH... YOU WILL HAVE TO TOLERATE HIS
OPINION, FIGHTING WON'T CHANGE IT.

QUI-GON MOVES OFF DOWN THE STREET. ANAKIN FOLLOWS. THE GREEDO WANDERS OVER
TO WALD WHO HAS BEEN WATCHING THE GOINGS-ON.

WALD : KEEP THIS UP, GREEDO, AND YOU'RE GONNA COME TO A BAD END.

FARTHER DOWN THE STREET QUI-GON AND ANAKIN HEAD TOWARD ANAKIN'S HOVEL.
QUI-GON TAKES A HANDFUL OF CREDITS FROM BENEATH HIS PONCHO AND HANDS THEM
TO THE BOY.

QUI-GON : THESE ARE YOURS. WE SOLD THE POD.
ANAKIN : (SUDDENLY BEAMING) YES!

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

SHMI IS CLEANING UP AS ANAKIN BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR, FOLLOWED BY QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : MOM, HE SOLD THE POD. LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY WE HAVE!

ANAKIN PULLS A BAG OF COINS OUT OF HIS POCKET.

SHMI : OH, MY GOODNESS, THAT'S WONDERFUL.
QUI-GON : AND ANAKIN HAS BEEN FREED.
ANAKIN : WHAT?!?
QUI-GON : YOU'RE NO LONGER A SLAVE.

ANAKIN JUMPS FOR JOY! SHMI IS STUNNED.

ANAKIN : DID YOU HEAR THAT, MOM? (TO QUI-GON) WAS THAT PART OF THE PRIZE,
OR WHAT?
QUI-GON : LET'S JUST SAY WATTO HAS LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON ABOUT
GAMBLING.
SHMI : NOW YOU CAN MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE, ANNIE. YOU'RE FREE! (TURNS
TO QUI-GON) WILL YOU TAKE HIM WITH YOU? IS HE TO BECOME A JEDI?
QUI-GON : OUR MEETING WAS NOT A COINCIDENCE. NOTHING HAPPENS BY ACCIDENT.
YOU ARE STRONG WITH THE FORCE, BUT YOU MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE COUCIL.
ANAKIN : A JEDI! MIGHTY BLASTERS, YOU MEAN I GET TO GO WITH YOU IN YOUR
STARSHIP AND EVERYTHING?!

QUI-GON KNEELS DOWN TO THE BOY.

QUI-GON : ANAKIN, TRAINING TO BE A JEDI WILL NOT BE A EASY CHALLENGE. AND
IF YOU SUCCEED, IT WILL BE A HARD LIFE.
ANAKIN : BUT IT'S WHAT I WANT. WHAT I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED ABOUT. CAN I GO,
MOM?!
QUI-GON : THIS PATH HAS BEEN PLACED FOR YOU, ANNIE; THE CHOICE TO TAKE IT
IS YOURS ALONE.

ANAKIN THINKS, LOOKS TO HIS MOTHER, THEN TO QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : I WANT TO GO.
QUI-GON : THEN, PACK YOUR THINGS. WE HAVEN'T MUCH TIME.
ANAKIN : YIPEE!!

ANAKIN HUGS HIS MOM AND STARTS FOR THE OTHER ROOM, THEN STOPS. SHMI AND
QUI-GON GIVE EACH OTHER A KNOWING LOOK. ANAKIN HAS REALIZED SOMETHING.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) WHAT ABOUT MOM? IS SHE FREE TOO? YOU'RE COMING, AREN'T
YOU, MOM
QUI-GON : I TRIED TO FREE YOUR MOTHER, ANNIE, BUT WATTO WOULDN'T HAVE IT.
ANAKIN : BUT THE MONEY FROM SELLING...
QUI-GON : IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH.

SHMI COMES OVER TO HER SON AND SITS NEXT TO HIM. TAKING BOTH OF HIS HANDS
IN HERS, SHE DRAWS HIM CLOSE.

SHMI : SON, MY PLACE IS HERE. MY FUTURE IS HERE. IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO LET
GO...TO LET GO OF ME. I CANNOT GO WITH YOU.
ANAKIN : I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU. I DON'T WANT THINGS TO CHANGE.
SHMI : YOU CAN'T STOP CHANGE ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN STOP THE SUNS FROM
SETTING. LISTEN TO YOUR FEELINGS; ANNIE, YOU KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT.

ANAKIN TAKES A DEEP BREATH, DROPS HIS HEAD. QUI-GON AND SHMI EXCHANGE A
LOOK OF CONCERN. WHEN ANAKIN RAISES UP, THERE ARE TEARS IN HIS EYES.

ANAKIN : I'M GOING TO MISS YOU SO MUCH, MOM...
SHMI : I LOVE YOU, ANNIE...NOW HURRY.

ANAKIN AND SHMI HUG. ANAKIN RUNS INTO THE OTHER ROOM.

SHMI : (CONT'D) THANK YOU.
QUI-GON : I WILL WATCH AFTER HIM. YOU HAVE MY WORD. WILL YOU BE ALL RIGHT?
SHMI : HE WAS IN MY LIFE FOR SUCH A SHORT TIME.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - SECOND ROOM - DAY

ANAKIN HAS THROWN THE LAST OF HIS THINGS IN A SMALL BACKPACK. AS HE LEAVES,
HE STOPS AND PUSHES THE BUTTON THAT WAKES HIS DROID UP. THREEPIO STARES AT
HIM BLANKLY.

ANAKIN : WELL, THREEPIO, I'M FREE...AND I'M GOING AWAY...IN A STARSHIP...
THREEPIO : MASTER, ANNIE, YOU ARE MY MAKER, AND I WISH YOU WELL. ALTHOUGH
I'D LIKE IT BETTER IF I WERE A LITTLE LESS NAKED.
ANAKIN : I'M SORRY I WASN'T ABLE TO FINISH YOU, THREEPIO...GIVE YOU
COVERINGS AND ALL... I'M GOING TO MISS WORKING ON YOU. YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT
PAL. I'LL MAKE SURE MOM DOESN'T SELL YOU OR ANYTHING. BYE.

THREEPIO STARES AT ANAKIN AS HE RUSHES OUT OF THE ROOM.

THREEPIO : SELL ME?!?

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

KITSTER RUNS UP TO ANAKIN AS HE AND QUI-GON EXIT ANAKIN'S HOVEL. SHMI
STANDS IN THE DOORWAY. ANAKIN PULLS A HANDFUL OF COINS OUT OF HIS POCKET
AND GIVES THEM TO KITSTER.

KITSTER : THERE ARE SO MANY OF US WHO WANT YOU TO STAY, ANNIE... YOU'RE A
HERO.
ANAKIN : I... (LOOKS TO SHMI) I... HAVE TO GO.

QUI-GON HAS MOVED A SHORT WAY DOWN THE STREET.

KITSTER : WELL.
ANAKIN : WELL.
KITSTER : THANK'S FOR EVERY MOMENT YOU'VE BEEN HERE. YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.
ANAKIN : I WON'T FORGET.

ANAKIN HUGS KITSTER AND RUNS TOWARD QUI-GON, THEN STOPS TO LOOK BACK AT HIS
MOTHER STANDING IN THE DOORWAY. HE TURNS BACK TO QUI-GON, THEN TURNS AND
RUNS BACK TO HIS MOTHER.

ANAKIN : (STARTING TO CRY) I CAN'T DO IT, MOM. I JUST CAN'T.

SHMI HUGS ANAKIN. QUI-GON WATCHES FROM THE DISTANCE. SHE KNEELS DOWN AND
LOOKS HIM IN THE FACE.

SHMI : ANNIE, REMEMBER WHEN YOU CLIMBED THE GREAT DUNE IN ORDER TO CHASE
THE BANTHAS AWAY SO THEY WOULDN'T BE SHOT... REMEMBER HOW YOU COLLAPSES
SEVERAL TIMES, EXHAUSTED THINKING YOU COULDN'T DO IT?

ANAKIN SHAKES HIS HEAD.

SHMI : (CONT'D) THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO. I KNOW HOW STRONG YOU ARE, ANNIE. I KNOW YOU
CAN DO THIS...
ANAKIN : WILL I EVER SEE YOU AGAIN?
SHMI : WHAT DOES YOUR HEART TELL YOU?
ANAKIN : I HOPE SO...YES...I GUESS.
SHMI : THEN WE WILL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.
ANAKIN : I.. WILL BECOME A JEDI AND I WILL COME BACK AND FREE YOU, MOM...I
PROMISE.
SHMI : NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, MY LOVE WILL BE WITH YOU. NOW BE BRAVE, AND
DON'T LOOK BACK... DON'T LOOK BACK.
ANAKIN : I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

SHMI HUGS ANAKIN, THEN TURNS HIM AROUND SO HE IS FACING QUI-GON, AND OFF HE
MARCHES, LIKE THE BRAVE LITTLE TROOPER THAT HE IS. HE MARCHES RIGHT PAST
QUI-GON, STARRING RIGHT AHEAD, TEARS IN HIS EYES, DETERMINED NOT TO LOOK
BACK.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - DAY

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN AND QUI-GON EXIT WATTO'S AND STOP BEFORE JIRA'S FRUIT STAND. ANAKIN
HANDS JIRA SOME COINS.

ANAKIN : I'VE BEEN FREED, AND I'M GOING AWAY. BUY YOURSELF A COOLING UNIT
WITH THIS... OTHERWISE I'LL WORRY ABOUT YOU.

JIRA IS ASTONISHED. SHE STARES, NOT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY.

JIRA : CAN I GIVE YOU A HUG
ANAKIN : SURE.

SHE GIVES HIM A HUG.

JIRA : I'LL MISS YOU, ANNIE.. THERE ISN'T A KINDER BOY IN THE GALAXY. YOU
BE CAREFUL...

ANAKIN RUNS TO JOIN QUI-GON, WHO HAS ALREADY STARTED DOWN THE STREET. AS
THEY WALK ALONG TOGETHER, QUI-GON NOTICES SOMETHING OUT OF THE CORNER OF
HIS EYE.
SUDDENLY, WITHOUT BREAKING HIS STRIDE, HE IGNITES HIS LASER SWORD, SWING
AROUND, AND LUNGES FORWARD AND CUTS A LURKING PROBE DROID IN HALF. QUI-GON
INSPECTS THE SPARKING AND FIZZING DROID.

ANAKIN : WHAT IS IT?
QUI-GON : PROBE DROID. VERY UNUSUAL... NOT LIKE ANYTHING I'VE SEEN BEFORE.
COME ON.

QUI-GON AND ANAKIN START RUNNING.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON AND ANAKIN RUN TOWARD THE NABOO SPACECRAFT. ANAKIN IS HAVING A HARD
TIME KEEPING UP.

ANAKIN : MASTER QUI-GON,SIR, WAIT!

QUI-GON TURNS TO ANSWER AND SEES A DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE BEARING DOWN ON A
SPEEDER BIKE.

QUI-GON : ANAKIN, DROP!

ANAKIN DROPS TO THE GROUND JUST AS DARTH MAUL SWEEPS OVER HIM. DARTH MAUL
JUMPS OFF HIS SPEEDER BIKE, AND BEFORE HE HAS HIT THE GROUND, THE SITH LORD
HAS SWUND A DEATH BLOW WITH HIS LASER SWORD THAT IS BARELY BLOCKED BY
QUI-GON.
ANAKIN PICKS HIMSELF UP. THE TWO GALACTIC WARRIORS, SITH AND JEDI, ARE
BASHING EACH OTHER WITH INCREDIBLE BLOWS. THEY MOVE IN A CONTINUAL CLOUDOF
DUST, SMASHING EVERYTHING AROUND THEM. THIS IS A FIERCE FIGHT. ANAKIN GETS
UP, BEWILDERED BY THE CONFRONTATION.

QUI-GON : (CONT'D) ANNIE, GET TO THE SHIP! TAKE OFF! GO! GO!

QUI-GON STRUGGLES TO FEND OFF THE RELENTLESS ONSLAUGHT AS ANAKIN RACES TO

OBI-WAN : OVER THERE! FLY LOW!

IN THE DISTANCE IS A SMALL CLOUD OF DUST.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON AND DARTH MAUL CONTINUE THEIRSWORD BATTLE. LEAPING OVER ONE ANOTHER
IN AN INCREDIBLE DISPLAY OF ACROBATICS, THE TWO WARRIOS HEAR THE SHIP FLY
OVER THEM A FEW FEET OFF THE GROUND. QUI-GON ALMOST DISSAPEARS FOR A
MOMENT.
BEFORE DARTH MAUL KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING, QUI-GON IS ON THE SPACECRAT'S
RAMP.

EXT. TATOOINE - NABOO SPACECRAFT RAMP - DAY

THE SITH LORD IMMEDIATELY JUMPS ONTO THE RAMP AFTER QUI-GON, BUT BARELY
MAKES IT. HIS HEELS HANG OVER THE EDGE OF A FORTY-FOOT DROP. QUI-GON SWINGS
HIS LASER SWORD WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND KNOCKS DARTH AMUL OFF THE RAMP AND
ONTO THE DESERT FLOOR. THE RAMP CLOSES, AND THE NABOO CRAFT ROCKETS AWAY,
LEAVING THE SITH LORD STANDING ALONE.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

THE SLEEK SPACECRAFT ROCKETS AWAY FROM THE PLANET TATOOINE.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN RUSH INTO THE HALLWAY TO FIND QUI-GON COLLAPSED ON THE
FLOOR OPPOSITE THE ENTRY. ARTOO IS LOOKING OVER HIM. THE JEDI IS BREATHING
HARD, WET WITH SWEAT AND COVERED IN DIRT.

ANAKIN : ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
QUI-GON : I THINK SO... THAT WAS A SURPIRSE I WONT SOON FORGET.
OBI-WAN : WHAT WAS IT?
QUI-GON : I DON'T KNOW... BUT HE WAS WELL TRAINED IN THE JEDI ARTS. MY
GUESS IS HE WAS AFTER THE QUEEN...
ANAKIN : DO YOU THINK HE'LL FOLLOW US?
QUI-GON : WE'LL BE SAFE ENOUGH ONCE WE'RE IN HYPERSPACE, BUT I HAVE NO

STARE.

EYES. HE IS HOLDING HIS ARMS TO KEEP HIMSELF WARM.

PADME : ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
ANAKIN : IT'S VERY COLD.

PADME GIVES HIM HER OVER-JACKET.

PADME : YOU'RE FROM A WARM PLANET, ANNIE. TOO WARM FOR MY TASTE. SPACE IS
COLD.
ANAKIN : YOU SEEM SAD.
PADME : THE QUEEN IS...WORRIED. HER PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING...DYING. SHE MUST
CONVINCE THE SENATE TO INTERVENE, OR...I'M NOT SURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
ANAKIN : I'M...I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME. I DUNNO IF I'LL
EVER SEE YOU AGAIN.. (HE PULLS SOMETHING FROM HIS POCKET) I MADE THIS FOR
YOU. SOU YOU'D REMEMBER ME. I CARVED IT OUT OF A JAPOR SNIPPET... IT WILL
BRING YOU GOOD FORTUNE.

ANAKIN HANDS A WOODEN PENDANT TO PADME. SHE INSPECTS IT, THEN PUTS IT
AROUND HER NECK.

PADME : IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BUT I DON'T NEED THIS TO REMEMBER YOU. MANY THINGS
WILL CHANGE WHEN WE REACH THE CAPITAL, ANNIE. MY CARING FOR YOU WILL ALWAYS
REMAIN.

PRESENT SUPREME CHANCELLOR VALORUM.
VALORUM : WELCOME, YOUR HIGHNESS. IT IS AN HONOR TO FINALLY MEET YOU IN
PERSON. I MUST RELAY TO YOU HOW DISTRESSED EVERYONE IS OVER THE CURRANT
SITUATION. I'VE CALLED FOR A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SENATE TO HEAR YOUR
POSITION.
AMIDALA : I AM GRATEFUL FOR YOUR CONCERN, CHANCELLOR.

PALPATINE STARTS TO LEAD QUEEN AMIDALA AND HER RETINUE OFF THE PLATFORM
TOWARD A WAITING AIR TAXI.

PALPATINE : THERE IS A QUESTION OF PRECEDURE, BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT WE CAN
OVERCOME IT...

JAR JAR AND ANAKIN START TO FOLLOW, THEN STOP, NOTICING THAT OBI-WAN AND

PALPATINE : ...THE REPUBLIC IS NOT WHAT IT ONCE WAS. THE SENATE IS FULL OF
GREEDY, SQUABBLING DELEGATES WHO ARE ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR THEMSELVES AND
THEIR HOME SYTEMS. THERE IS NO INTEREST IN THE COMMON GOOD...NO CIVILITY,
ONLY POLITICS...ITS DISGUSTING. I MUST BE FRANK, YOUR MAJESTY, THERE IS
LITTLE CHANCE THE SENATE WILL ACT ON THE INVASION.
AMIDALA : CHANCELLOR VALORUM SEEMS TO THINK THERE IS HOPE.
PALPATINE : IF I MAY SAY SO, YOUR MAJESTY, THE CHANCELLOR HAS LITTLE REAL
POWER...HE IS MIRED DOWN BY BASELESS ACCUSATIONS OF CORRUPTION. A
MANUFACTURED SCANDAL SURROUNDS HIM. THE BUREAUCRATS ARE IN CHARGE NOW.
AMIDALA : WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE?
PALPATINE : OUR BEST CHOICE WOULD BE TO PUSH FOR THE ELECTION OF A STRONGER
SUPREME CHANCELLOR. ONE WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL OF THE BUREAUCRATS, ENFORCES
THE LAWS, AND GIVE US JUSTICE. YOU COULD CALL FOR A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE
IN CHANCELLOR VALORUM.
AMIDALA : HE HAS BEEN OUR STRONGEST SUPPORTER. IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY?
PALPATINE : OUR ONLY OTHER CHOICE WOULD TO BE TO SUBMIT A PLEA TO THE
COURTS...
AMIDALA : THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT. THE COURTS TAKE EVEN LONGER TO DECIDE
THINGS THAN THE SENATE. OUR PEOPLE ARE DYING, SENATOR...MORE AND MORE EACH
DAY. WE MUST DO SOMETHING QUICKLY TO STOP THE FEDERATION.
PALPATINE : TO BE REALISTIC, YOUR HIGHNESS, I'D SAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
ACCEPT FEDERATION CONTROL FOR THE TIME BEING.
AMIDALA : THERE IS SOMETHING I CANNOT DO.

BALANCE TO THE FORCE...YOU BELIEVE IT'S THIS BOY??
QUI-GON : I DON'T PRESSUME...

DOWN, THEN TAKES A PEEK AT HER.

AMIDALA : I'VE SENT PADME ON AN ERRAND.
ANAKIN : I'M GOING TO THE JEDI TEMPLE TO START MY TRAINING, I HOPE.

THE QUEEN JUST STARES AT HIM.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) I MAY NOT SEE HER AGAIN...AND... I JUST WANTED TO SAY
GOODBYE.
AMIDALA : WE WILL TELL HER FOR YOU. WE'RE SURE HER HEART GOES WITH YOU.

ANAKIN BOWS AGAIN.

AMIDALA : (ANGRILY) I WILL NOT DEFER...I HAVE COME BEFORE YOU TO RESOLVE
THIS ATTACK ON OUR SOVEREIGNTY NOW. I WAS NOT ELECTED TO WATCH MY PEOPLE
SUFFER AND DIE WHILE YOU DISCUSS THIS INVASION IN A COMMITTEE. IF THIS BODY
IS NOT CAPABLE OF ACTION, I SUGGEST NEW LEADERSHIP IS NEEDED. I MOVE FOR A
"VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE"...IN CHANCELLOR VALORUM'S LEADERSHIP.
VALORUM : WHAT?...NO!

THIS CAUSES A GREAT STIR IN THE ASSEMBLY. A LOUD MUMUR CRESENDOS INTO A
ROAR OF APPROVAL AND JEERS. CHANCELLOR VALORUM IS STUNNED AND STANDS

YOU TO WATCH ME AND BE MINDFUL...ALWAYS REMEMBER, YOUR FOCUS DETERMINES
YOUR REALITY. STAY CLOSE TO ME AND YOU WILL BE SAFE.
ANAKIN : MASTER, SIR...I'VE BEEN WONDERING...WHAT ARE MIDI-CHLORIANS?
QUI-GON : MIDI-CHLORIANS ARE A MICROCOPIC LIFEFORM THAT RESIDE WITHIN ALL
LIVING CELLS AND COMMUNICATES WITH THE FORCE.
ANAKIN : THEY LIVE INSIDE OF ME?
QUI-GON : IN YOUR CELLS. WE ARE SYMBIONTS WITH THE MIDI-CHLORIANS.
ANAKIN : SYMBIONTS?
QUI-GON : LIFE FORMS LIVING TOGETHER FOR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE. WITHOUT THE
MIDI-CHLORIANS, LIFE COULD NOT EXIST, AND WE WOULD HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE
FORCE. THEY CONTINUALLY SPEAK TO YOU, TELLING YOU THE WILL OF THE FORCE.

PADME : WHAT IS THE SITUATION?
CAPT. PANAKA : ALMOST EVERYONE'S IN CAMPS. A FEW HUNDRED POLICE AND GUARDS
HAVE FORMED AN UNDERGROUND MOVEMENT. I BROUGHT AS MANY OF THE KEADERS AS I
COULD. THE FEDERATION ARMY'S ALSO MUCH LARGER THAN WE THOUGHT, AND MUCH
STRONGER. YOUR HIGHNESS, THIS IS A BATTLE I DO NOT THINK WE CAN WIN.
PADME : THE BATTLE IS A DIVERSION. THE GUNGANS MUST DRAW THEDROID ARMY AWAY
FROM THE CITIES. WE CAN ENTER THE CITY USING THE SECRET PASSAGES ON THE
WATERFALL SIDE. ONCE WE GET TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE, CAPTAIN PNAKA WILL CREATE
A DIVERSION, SO THAT WE CAN ENTER THE PALACE AND CAPTURE THE VICEROY.
WITHOUT THE VICEROY, THEY WILL BE LOST AND CONFUSED.

WHAT PILOTS WE HAVE TO KNOCK OUT THE DROID CONTROL SHIP WHICH IS ORBITING
THE PLANET. IF WE CAN GET PAST THEIR RAYSHIELDS, WE CAN SEVER COMMUNICATION
AND THEIR DROIDS WILL BE HELPLESS.
QUI-GON : A WELL-CONCEIVED PLAN. HOWEVER, THERE'S GREAT RISK. THE WEAPONS
ON YOUR FIGHTERS MAY NOT PENETRATE THE SHIELDS ON THE CONTROL SHIP.
OBI-WAN : AND THERE'S AN EVEN BIGGER DANGER. IF THE VICROY ESCAPES, YOUR
HIGHNESS, HE WILL RETURN WITH ANOTHER DROID ARMY.
PADME : THAT IS WHY WE MUST NOT FAIL TO GET TO THE VICEROY. EVERYTHING
DEPENDS ON IT.

THE SITH LORD, FOLLOWED BY QUI-GON, ENTERS A LONG HALLWAY FILLED WITH A
SERIES OF DEADLY RAYS THAT GO ON AND OFF IN A PULSING PATTERN THAT SHOOTS
DOWN THE CORRIDOR EVERY MINUTE OR SO. DARTH MAUL MAKES IT DOWN SEVERAL
WALLS OF DEADLY RAYS BEFORE THEY CLOSE. QUI-GON IS ONE WALL AWAY FROM THE
DARK LORD. OBI-WAN IS JUST STARTING INTO IT AND IS FIVE WALLS WAY FROM
DARTH MAUL.
THE JEDI MUST WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT PULSE TO ADVANCE DOWN THE CORRIDOR.
OBI-WAN IS IMPATIENT AND PACES, WAITING FOR THE WALL OF RAYS TO OPEN.
QUI-GON SITS AND MEDITATES. THE SITH LORD TRIES TO PATCH UP HIS WOUNDS.

RAYS TURN AWAY, AND OBI-WAN STARTS RUNNING TOWARD QUI-GON AND THE DARK
LORD. WHEN THE WALL BETWEEN QUI-GON AND DARTH MAUL OPENS, QUI-GON IS IN A
SPLIT SECOND FIGHTING THE DARK LORD WITH A FEROCITY NOT SEEN BEFORE. THEY
MOVE INTO THE AREA AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR CALLED THE MELTING PIT, A
SMALL AREA THAT IS MOSTLY MADE UP OF A DEEP HOLE.
THE ELECTRON RAY GATES BEGIN TO CLOSE. OBI-WAN TRIES TO MAKE IT TO THE
MELTING PIT BUT IS CAUGHT ONE GATE SHORT. HE SLIDES TO A STOP JUST BEFORE
HE HITS THE DEADLY ELECTRON FIELD.
QUI-GON AND DARTH MAUL BATTLE AROUND THE MELTING PIT AS A FRUSTRATED
OBI-WAN WATCHES.

SIX OF THE DROIDS RUSH OUT OF THE THRONE ROOM AFTER SABE. NUTE TURNS TO
PADME.

NUTE : (CONT'D) YOUR QUEEN WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS.

HUNDREDS OF DESTROYER DROIDS BREAK IN TO RESCUE US.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT

OBI-WAN SCREAMS AS THE PULSING ELECTRON GATE OPENS, AND THE SITH LORD
ATTACKS HIM. THE DARK LORD IS RELENTLESS IN HIS ASSAULT ON THE YOUNG JEDI.
OBI-WAN AND DARTH MAUL USE THE FORCE TO FLING OBJECTS AT EACH OTHER AS THEY
FIGHT. DARTH MAUL SEEMS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND AS OBI-WAN GROWS WEARY.
DARTH MAUL CATCHES OBI-WAN OFF GUARD, AND THE JEDI SLIPS INTO A MELTING
PIT. HE IS BARELY ABLE TO HOLD ONTO A NOZZLE ON THE SIDE OF THE PIT. DARTH
MAUL GRIN EVILLY AT OBI-WAN AS HE KICKS OBI-WAN'S LIGHTSABER DOWN THE
ENDLESS SHAFT.
THE SITH LORD SMILES AS HE GOES IN FOR THE KILL. AT THE LAST MOMENT,

DARTH MAUL OFF. THE YOUNG JEDI SWINGS WITH A VENGEANCE, CUTTING THE SITH
DOWN. DARTH MAUL FALLS INTO THE MELTING PIT TO HIS DEATH.
OBI-WAN RUSHES OVER TO QUI-GON, WHO IS DYING.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) THE SYSTEMS ARE STILL OVERHEATED, ARTOO.

THE BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN WALKS UP TO THE SHIP AND SEES ARTOO.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : WHERE'S YOUR PILOT?

ARTOO BEEPS A REPLY.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (CONT'D) YOU'RE THE PILOT?

ARTOO WHISTLES.

ANAKIN : YES...WE HAVE IGNITION.

HE FLIPS THE SWITCH AND THE ENGINE STARTS.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (SEEING ANAKIN) YOU! COME OUT OF THERE OR WE'LL
BLAST YOU!
ANAKIN : NOT IF I CAN HELP IT! SHIELDS UP!

ANAKIN FLIPS A SWITCH AND THE SHIP LEVITATES, KNOCKING OVER THE BATTLE
DROID CAPTAIN. THE OTHER DROIDS SHOOT, BUT THE LASERS ARE DEFLECTED BY
ANAKIN'S SHIELDS. ARTOO BEEEPS.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) THIS SHOULD STOP THEM.

ANAKIN FIRES LASERS AS THE SHIP BEGINS TO ROTATE.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) ...AND TAKE THIS!

HE PRESSES A BUTTON AND LAUNCHES TWO TORPEDOS WHICH MISS THE DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) DARN...I MISSED!

THE TWO TORPEDOS FLY DOWN A HALLWAY AND EXPLODE INSIDE THE REACTOR ROOM.

ANAKIN : (CONT'D) LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

ANAKIN'S SHIP ROARS THROUGH THE HANGER DECK, BOUNCING OVER THE DROIDS.

ANAKIN'S SHIP SKIDS TO A STOP BEHIND THE OTHER NABOO STARFIGHTERS. RIC
OLIE, BRAVO TWO, THE OTHER PILOTS, AND GROUND CREW RUSH TO HIS SHIP.

RIC OLIE : WE'RE ALL ACCOUNTED FOR. WHO FLEW THAT SHIP?

ON YOU TAKING THIS BOY AS YOUR PADAWAN LEARNER, I DO NOT.
OBI-WAN : QUI-GON BELIEVED IN HIM. I BELIEVE IN QUI-GON.

HIS TRAINING.
OBI-WAN : MASTER YODA, IGAVE QUI-GON MY WORD. I WILL TRAIN ANAKIN. WITHOUT

OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN : HE IS ONE WITH THE FORCE, ANAKIN...YOU MUST LET GO.
ANAKIN : WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME NOW?
OBI-WAN : I AM YOUR MASTER NOW. YOU WILL BECOME A JEDI, I PROMISE.

TO ONE SIDE, MACE WINDU TURNS TO YODA.

MACE WINDU : THERE IS NO DOUBT. THE MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR WAS A SITH.

EXT. SPACE
A VAST SEA OF STARS SEVERAS AS A BACKDROP FOR THE MAIN TITLE, FOLLOWING BY A ROLLUP, WHCIH CRAWLS INTO INFINITY.

				THERE IS UNREST IN THE GALACTIC SENATE
				SEVERAL HUNDRED SOLAR SYSTEMS UNDER
				THE LEADERSHIP OF THE REBEL LEADER, COUNT
				DOOKU, HAVE DECALRED THEIR INTENTIONS TO
				SECEDE FROM THE REPUBLIC.

				THIS SEPARATIST MOVEMENT HAS MADE IT
				DIFFICULT FOR THE LIMITED NUMBER OF
				JEDI KIGHTS TO MAINTAIN PEACE AND
				ORDER IN THE GALAXY.

				SENATOR AMIDALA, THE FORMER QUEEN OF
				NABOO, IS RETURNING TO CORUSCANT
				TO VOTE ON THE CRITICAL ISSUE
				OF CREATING AN ARMY TO ASSIST THE
				OVERWHELMED JEDI.

PAN UP TO REVEAL THE AMBER CITY PLANET OF CORUSCANT. A YELLOW NABOO FIGHTER FLIES OVER CAMERA TOWARD THE PLANET, FOLLOWED BY A LARGE ROYAL CRUISER AND TWO MORE FIGHTERS.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
THE SHIPS SKIM ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THE CITY LANDSCAPE. THE SUN GLINTS OFF THE CHROME HULLS OF THE SLEEK NABOO SPACECRAFT AS THEY NAVIGATE BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS OF THE CAPITAL PLANET.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
TWO NABOO FIGHTERS LAND ON ONE LEAF OF A THREE-LEAF-CLOVER LANDING PLATFORM. THE ROYAL STARSHIP LANDS ON THE CENTRAL LEAD, AND THE THIRD FIGHTER LANDS ON THE REMAINING PLAFORM.

A SMALL GROUP OF DIGNITARIES WAITS TO WELCOME THE SENATOR. ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP OS A WELL DRESSED JAR JAR BINKS, A MEMBER OF THE GALACTIC REPRESENTATIVE COMMISSION, AND DORME, SENATOR AMIDALA'S HANDMAIDEN.

ONE OF THE FIGHTER PILOTS JUMPS FROM THE WING OF HIS SHIP AND REMOVES HIS HELMET. HE IS CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S SECURITY OFFICER. HE MOVES OVER TO A WOMAN PILOT.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
WE MADE IT. I GUESS I WAS WRONG,
THERE WAS NO DANGER AT ALL.

THE RAMP ;PWERS. TWO NABOO GUARDS APPEAR. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) AND FOUR TROOPERS DESCEND THE RAMP. AMIDALA IS MORE BEAUTIFUL NOW THAN SHE WAS TEN YEARS EARLIER WHEN, AS QUEEN, SHE WAS FREEING HER PEOPLE FROM THE YOKE OF THE TRADE FEDERATION.

THE DIGNITARIES START TO MOVE FORWARD. SENATOR AMIDALA REACHES THE FOOT OF THE RAMP, WHEN SUDDENLY THERE IS A BLINDING FLASH AND A HUGE EXPLOSION. THE DIGNITARIES AND PILOTS ARE HURLED TO THE GROUND AS THE STARSHIP IS DESTROYED.

KLAXONS BLARE, ALARMS SOUND! CAPTAIN TYPHO AND THE TWO ESCORT PILOTS GET UP AND RUN TO WHERE SENATOR AMIDALA LIES DYING. BEYOND, ARTOO DETOO DROPS DOWN FROM THE NABOO FIGHTER AND ROLLS TOWARD THE WRECKAGE. THE FEMALE ESCORT PILOT KNEELS BY SENATOR AMIDALA AND TAKES OFF HER HELMET, REVEALING SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.

				PADM�
			CORD�...

SHE GATHERS UP HER DECOY DOUBLE IN HER ARMS. CORD�'S EYES ARE OPEN. SHE LOOKS UP AT HER.

				CORD�
			... I'M SORRY, M'LADY... I'M... NOT SURE I...

CORD� DIES. PADM� HUGS HER.

				AMIDALA
			NO!... NO!... NO!...

PADM� LOWERS CORD� TO THE GROUND. SHE GETS UP AND LOOKS AROUND AT THE DEVASTATION. THERE ARE TEARS IN HER EYES.

				AMIDALA
			I SHOULD NOT HAVE COME BACK.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			M'LADY, YOU ARE STILL IN DANGER.

AMIDALA SAYS NOTHING.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			THIS VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU DID
			YOUR DUTY AND CORD� DID HERS. NOW
			COME. (SHE DOESN'T RESPOND) M'LADY,
			PLEASE!

SHE TURNS. THEY WALK AWAY. ARTOO LETS OUT A SMALL WHIMPER AND ROLLS OFF AFTER THEM.

EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY
THE MASSIVE SENATE BUILDING GLISTENS IN THE AFTERNOON SUN. SMALL PATCHES OF FOG HAVE STILL TO BURN OFF.

INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
THE VAST ROTUNDA IS BUZZING WITH CHATTER. MAS AMEDDA, THE SUPREME CHANCELLOR'S MAJORDOMO, TRIES TO QUIET THINGS DOWN AS PALPATINE CONFERS WITH AN AIDE, UV GIZEN, RIDING A SMALL ONE MAN FLOATING SCOOTER.

				MAS AMEDDA
			ORDER! WE SHALL HAVE ORDER! THE MOTION
			FOR THE REPUBLIC TO COMMISSION AN ARMY
			TAKES PRECEDENT, AND THAT IS WHAT WE
			WILL VOTE ON AT THIS TIME.

EVERYTHING QUIETS DOWN. THE AIDE DISPERSES, AND SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE STEPS TO THE PODIUM.

				PALPATINE
			...MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES, EXCUSE
			ME... I HAVE JUST RECEIVED SOME
			TRAGIC AND DISTURBING NEWS. SENATOR
			AMIDALA OF THE NABOO SYSTEM... HAS
			BEEN ASSASSINATED!

THERE IS A SHOCK SILENCE IN THE VAST ARENA.

				PALPATINE
				(CONTINUED)
			THIS GRIEVOUS BLOW IS ESPECIALLY
			PERSONAL TO ME. BEFORE I BECAME
			CHANCELLOR, I SERVED AMIDALA WHEN
			SHE WAS QUEEN. SHE WAS A GREAT
			LEADER WHO FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE, NOT
			ONLY IN THIS HONOURABLE ASSEMBLY,
			BUT ALSO ON HER HOME PLANET. SHE
			WAS SO LOVED SHE COULD HAVE BEEN
			ELECTED QUEEN FOR LIFE. SHE
			BELIEVED IN PUBLIC SERVICE, AND
			SHE FERVENTLY BELIEVED IN
			DEMOCRACY. HER DEATH IS A GREAT
			LOSS TO US ALL. WE WILL ALL MOURN
			HER AS A RELENTLESS CHAMPION OF
			FREEDOM... AND AS A DEAR FRIEND.

THERE IS A MOMENT OF SILENCE. ASK AAK, THE SENATOR OF MALASTARE, MOVES HIS POD INTO THE CENTRE OF THE ARENA.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			HOW MANY MORE SENATORS WILL DIE
			BEFORE THIS CIVIL STRIFE ENDS! WE
			MUST CONFRONT THESE REBELS NOW,
			AND THEY NEED AN ARMY TO DO IT.

A SECOND POD MOVES INTO THE CENTRE OF THE AREA WITH DARSANA, THE
AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.

				AMBASSADOR DARSANA
			WHY WEREN'T THE JEDI ABLE TO STOP
			THIS ASSASSINATION? WE ARE NO
			LONGER SAFE, UNDER THEIR PROTECTION.

SENATOR ORN FREE TAA SWINGS FORWARD IN HIS POD.

				ORN FREE TAA
			THE REPUBLIC NEEDS MORE SECURITY
			NOW! BEFORE IT COMES TO WAR.

				PALPATINE
			MUST I REMIND THE SENATOR FROM
			MALASTARE THAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE
			CONTINUING WITH THE SEPARATISTS.
			PEACE IS OUR OBJECTIVE HERE... NOT
			WAR.

THE SENATORS YELL PRO AND CON. MAS AMEDDA TRIES TO CALM THINGS DOWN. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, WITH CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, AND DORME, MANOEUVRE HER POD INTO THE CENTRE OF THE VAST ARENA.

				AMIDALA
			MY NOBLE COLLEAGUES, I CONCUR WITH
			THE SUPREME CHANCELLOR. AT ALL
			COSTS, WE DO NOT WANT WAR!

THE SENATE GOES QUIET, THEN THERE IS AN OUTBURST OF CHEERING AND
APPLAUSE.

				PALPATINE
			IT IS WITH GREAT SURPRISE AND
			JOY THE CHAIR RECOGNISES THE
			SENATOR FROM NABOO, PADM� AMIDALA.

				PADM�
			LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO, AN
			ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT WAS MADE
			AGAINST MY LIFE. ONE OF MY
			BODYGUARDS AND SIX  OTHERS WERE
			RUTHLESSLY AND SENSELESSLY
			MURDERED. I WAS THE TARGET BUT,
			MORE IMPORTANTLY, I BELIEVE THIS
			SECURITY MEASURE BEFORE YOU, WAS
			THE TARGET. I HAVE LED THE
			OPPOSITION TO BUILD AN ARMY... BUT
			THERE IS SOMEONE IN THIS BODY WHO
			WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO ASSURE IT'S
			PASSAGE...

MANY OF THE SENATORS BOO AND YELL AT SENATOR AMIDALA.

				PADM�
			 	(CONTINUING)
			I WARN YOU, IF YOU VOTE TO CREATE
			THIS ARMY, WAR WILL FOLLOW. I
			HAVE EXPERIENCED THE MISERY OF WAR
			FIRST-HAND; I DO NOT WISH TO DO IT
			AGAIN.

THERE IS SPORADIC YELLING FOR AND AGAINST HER STATEMENTS.

				PADM�
			WAKE UP, SENATORS... YOU MUST WAKE
			UP! IF YOU OFFER THE SEPARATISTS
			VIOLENCE, THEY CAN ONLY SHOW US
			VIOLENCE IN RETURN! MANY WILL
			LOSE THEIR LIVES. ALL WILL LOSE
			THEIR FREEDOM. THIS DECISION
			COULD VERY WELL DESTROY THE VERY
			FOUNDATION OF OUR GREAT REPUBLIC.
			I PRAY YOU DO NOT LET FEAR PUSH
			YOU INTO A DISASTROUS DECISION.
			VOTE DOWN THIS SECURITY MEASURE,
			WHICH IS NOTHING LESS THAN A
			DECLARATION OF WAR! DOES ANYONE
			HERE WANT THAT? I CANNOT BELIEVE
			THEY DO.

THERE IS AN UNDERCURRENT OF BOOING... AND GROANING. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA MOVES HIS POD NEXT TO AMIDALA.

				ORN FREE TAA
			MY MOTION TO DEFER THE VOTE MUST
			BE DEALT WITH FIRST. THAT IS THE
			RULE OF LAW.

AMIDALA LOOKS ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED. PALPATINE GIVES HER A SYMPATHETIC LOOK.

				PALPATINE
			DUE TO THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR
			AND THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS
			MOTION, WE WILL TAKE UP THESE
			MATTERS TOMORROW. UNTIL THEN, THE
			SENATE STANDS ADJOURNED.

EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY
THE GIANT TOWERS OF THE REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING SEEM TO REACH THE HEAVENS. TRAFFIC CLOGS THE SMOGGY SKY.

INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE SITS BEHIND HIS DESK WITH TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DOOR. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, AND MACE WINDU SIT ACRESS FROM HIM.

				PALPATINE
			I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN
			HOLD OFF THE VOTE, MY FRIENDS.
			MORE AND MORE STAR SYSTEMS ARE
			JOINING THE SEPARATISTS.

				MACE WINDU
			IF THEY DO BREAK AWAY -

				PALPATINE
			NO! I WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN!

				MACE WINDU
			BUT IF THEY DO, YOU MUST REALISE
			THERE AREN'T ENOUGH JEDI TO
			PROTECT THE REPUBLIC. WE ARE
			KEEPERS OF THE PEACE, NOT SOLDIERS.

				PALPATINE
			MASTER YODA, DO YOU THINK IT WILL
			REALLY COME TO WAR?

YODA CLOSES HIS EYES.

				YODA
			WORSE THAN WAR, I FEAR... MUCH
			WORSE.

				PALPATINE
			WHAT?

				MACE WINDU
			WHAT DO YOU SENSE, MASTER?

				YODA
			IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE ... THE DARK SIDE
			CLOUDS EVERYTHING. BUT THIS I AM
			SURE OF -
				(OPENS HIS EYES)
			DO THEIR DUTY THE JEDI WILL.

A MUTED BUZZER SOUNDS. A HOLOGRAM OF AN AIDE, DAR WAC, APPEARS ON THE CHANCELLOR'S DESK.

				DAR WAC
			THE LOYALIST COMMITTEE HAS ARRIVED,
			MY LORD.

				PALPATINE
			SEND THEM IN.

THEY ALL STAND AS SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, AND SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER AND ORN FREE TAA ENTER THE OFFICE. YODA AND MACE WINDU MOVE TO GREET THE SENATOR, YODA TAPS AMIDALA WITH HIS CANE.

				YODA
			WITH YOU THE FORCE IS STRONG...
			YOUNG SENATOR. TO SEE YOU ALIVE
			BRINGS WARM FEELING TO MY HEART.

				PADM�
			THANK YOU, MASTER YODA. DO YOU
			HAVE ANY IDEA WHO WAS BEHIND
			THE ATTACK?

				MACE WINDU
			OUR INTELLIGENCE POINTS TO
			DISGRUNTLED SPICE MINERS, ON
			THE MOONS OF NABOO.

				PADM�
			I DON'T WISH TO DISAGREE BUT I
			THINK THAT COUNT DOOKU WAS BEHIND
			IT.

THERE IS A STIR OF SURPRISE.

				MACE WINDU
			YOU KNOW, M'LADY, COUNT DOOKU
			WAS ONCE A JEDI. HE WOULDN'T
			ASSASSINATE ANYONE, IT IS NOT IN
			HIS CHARACTER.

				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			HE IS A POLITICAL IDEALIST, NOT
			A MURDERER.

				YODA
			IN DARK TIMES NOTHING IS WHAT IT
			APPEARS TO BE, BUT THE FACT REMAINS
			SENATOR, IN GRAVE DANGER YOU ARE.

PALPATINE GETS UP, WALKS TO THE WINDOW, AND LOOKS OUT AT THE VAST CITY.

				PALPATINE
			COUNT DOOKU HAS ALWAYS AVOIDED
			ANY KIND OF CONFLICT. IT APPEARS
			HE HAS NO DESIRE TO START A WAR.
			WHY WOULD HE KILL YOU? TO WHAT END?

				PADM�
			I DON'T KNOW, BUT EVERYTHING IN MY
			BEING TELLS ME HE WAS BEHIND IT...

AFTER GAZING OUT OF THE WINDOW FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS PALPATINE TURNS TO
MACE.

				PALPATINE
			MASTER JEDI, MAY I SUGGEST THAT
			THE SENATOR BE PLACED UNDER THE
			PROTECTION OF YOUR GRACES.

				BAIL ORGANA
			DO YOU THINK THAT IS A WISE USE
			OF MANPOWER DURING THESE STRESSFUL
			TIMES?

				PADM�
			CHANCELLOR, IF I MAY COMMENT, I
			DO NOT BELIEVE THE...

				PALPATINE
			..."SITUATION IS THAT SERIOUS."
			NO, BUT I DO, SENATOR.

				PADM�
			CHANCELLOR, PLEASE! I DON'T WANT
			ANY MORE GUARDS!

				PALPATINE
			I REALISE ALL TOO WELL THAT
			ADDITIONAL SECURITY MIGHT BE
			DISRUPTIVE FOR YOU, BUT PERHAPS
			SOMEONE YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH... AN
			OLD FRIEND LIKE... MASTER KENOBI...

PALPATINE NODS TO MACE WINDU, WHO NODS BACK.

				MACE WINDU
			THAT'S POSSIBLE. HE HAS JUST
			RETURNED FROM A BORDER DISPUTE ON
			ANSION.

				PALPATINE
			YOU MUST REMEMBER HIM, M'LADY...
			HE WATCHED OVER YOU DURING THE
			BLOCKADE CONFLICT.

				PADM�
			THIS IS NOT NECESSARY, CHANCELLOR.

				PALPATINE
			DO IT FOR ME, M'LADY, PLEASE. I
			WILL REST EASIER. WE HAD A BIG
			SCARE TODAY. THE THOUGHT OF
			LOSING YOU IS UNBEARABLE.

AMIDALA SIGHS AS THE JEDI GET UP TO LEAVE.

				MACE WINDU
			I WILL HAVE OBI-WAN REPORT TO YOU
			IMMEDIATELY, M'LADY.

YODA LEANS INTO HER EAR.

				YODA
			TOO LITTLE ABOUT YOURSELF YOU
			WORRY, SENATOR, AND TOO MUCH ABOUT
			POLITICS. BE MINDFUL OF YOUR
			DANGER, PADM�. ACCEPT OUR HELP.

AS THE JEDI LEAVE THE OFFICE, PALPATINE CONTINUES TO PACE BEHIND HIS DESK.

				PALPATINE
			I WILL NOT LIKE THIS REPUBLIV, THAT
			HAS STOOD FOR OVER A THOUSAND
			YEARS, BE SPLIT IN TWO

			TO SEE'EN YOUSA. WAHOOOOOO!

OBI-WAN SMILES.

				OBI-WAN
			IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO, JAR JAR.

				JAR JAR
			OOPS! WHERESA MESA MANNERS?
			EXCUSE ME, MASTER OBI-WAN. I
			COMPLETELY FORGOT MYSELF FOR
			A MOMENT THERE. I HAVE HAD TO LEARN
			DIPLODIACLECT... SPEAK IT LIKE A
			NATIVE NOW. DON'T REALLY SEE THE
			POINT, ACTUALLY, BUT MEMBERS OF
			THE SENATE SEEM TO PREFER IT...

JAR JAR NOTICES OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.

				JAR JAR
				(CONTINUING)
			...AND THIS, I TAKE IT, IS YOUR
			APPRENTICE... NOOOOOOOOO! ANNIE?
			NOOOOOOOO! LITTLE BITTY ANNIE?
				(LOOKS AT ANAKIN)
			NOOOOOOO! YOUSA SO BIGGEN!
			YIYIYIYYI! ANNIE!! MESA NO
			BELIEVEN.

				ANAKIN
			HI, JAR JAR.

JAR JAR GRABS HOLD OF ANAKIN AND ENVELOPS HIM IN A BIG HUG.

				JAR JAR
			ANNIE! ANNIE! YIYIYIYIYIYIIII!

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING
PADME IS IN A CONFERENCE WITH CAPTAIN TYPHO AND DORME. JAR JAR ENTERS THE ROOM, FOLLOWED BY THE TWO JEDI.

				JAR JAR
			LOOKIE... LOOKIE... OOPS!... OH,
			DEAR, I'M AFRAID I'VE FORGOTTEN
			MYSELF AGAIN.

PADME AND TYPHO RISE AS OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN STOP BEFORE THE SENATOR. OBI-WAN STEPS FORWARD. ANAKIN STARES AT PADME. SHE GLANCES AT HIM.

				OBI-WAN
			IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
			M'LADY.

				PADM�
			IT HAS BEEN FAR TOO LONG MASTER
			KENOBI. I'M SO GLAD OUR PATHS
			HAVE CROSSED AGAIN... BUT I MUST
			WARN YOU THAT I THINK YOUR
			PRESENCE HERE IS UNNECESSARY.

				OBI-WAN
			I'M SURE THE JEDI COUNCIL HAVE
			THEIR REASONS.

SHE MOVES IN FRONT OF ANAKIN

				PADM�
			ANNIE??
				(STARES)
			MY GOODNESS YOU'VE GROWN.

THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER FOR A LONG MOMENT.

				ANAKIN
				(TRYING TO BE SMOOTH)
			SO HAVE YOU... GROWN MORE
			BEAUTIFUL, I MEAN... AND MUCH
			SHORTER... FOR A SENATOR, I MEAN.

OBI-WAN LOOKS DISAPPROVINGLY AT HIS APPRENTICE. PADME LAUGHS AND SHAKES HER HEAD.

				PADM�
			OH ANNIE, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE THAT
			LITTLE BOY I KNEW ON TATOOINE.

THIS EMBARRASSES ANAKIN, AND HE LOOKS DOWN. OBI-WAN AND CAPTAIN TYPHO SMILE.

				OBI-WAN
			OUR PRESENCE WILL BE INVISIBLE,
			M'LADY.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I AM VERY GRATEFUL YOU ARE HERE,
			MASTER KENOBI. THE SITUATION IS
			MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE SENATOR
			WILL ADMIT.

				PADM�
			I DON'T NEED MORE SECURITY, I NEED
			ANSWERS. I WANT TO KNOW WHO IS
			TRYING TO KILL ME.

				OBI-WAN
				(FROWNING)
			WE'RE HERE TO PROTECT YOU
			SENATOR, NOT TO START AN
			INVESTIGATION.

				ANAKIN
			WE WILL FIND OUT WHO IS TRYING TO
			KILL YOU PADM�, I PROMISE YOU.

HE'S DONE IT AGAIN. HE BITES HIS LIP IN FRUSTRATION AND SHAME. OBI-WAN GIVES ANAKIN A DIRTY LOOK.

				OBI-WAN
			WE ARE NOT GOING TO EXCEED OUR
			MANDATE, MY YOUNG PADAWAN LEARNER.

				ANAKIN
			I MEANT IN THE INTEREST OF
			PROTECTING HER, MASTER, OF COURSE.

				OBI-WAN
			WE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THIS
			EXERCISE AGAIN, ANAKIN. YOU WILL
			PAY ATTENTION TO MY LEAD.

				ANAKIN
			WHY?

				OBI-WAN
			WHAT??!!

				ANAKIN
			WHY ELSE DO YOU THINK WE WERE
			ASSIGNED TO HER, IF NOT TO FIND
			THE KILLER? PROTECTION IS A JOB
			FOR LOCAL SECURITY... NOT JEDI.
			IT'S OVERKILL, MASTER.
			INVESTIGATION IS IMPLIED IN OUR
			MANDATE.

				OBI-WAN
			WE WILL DO AS THE COUNCIL HAS
			INSTRUCTED, AND YOU WILL LEARN
			YOUR PLACE, YOUNG ONE.

				PADM�
			PERHAPS WITH MERELY YOUR PRESENCE,
			THE MYSTERIES SURROUNDING THIS
			THREAT WILL BE REVEALED.  NOW IF
			YOU WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL RETIRE.

EVERYONE GIVES AMIDALA A SLIGHT BOW AS SHE AND DORME LEAVE THE ROOM.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			WELL, I KNOW I FEEL A LOT BETTER
			HAVING YOU HERE.
			I'LL HAVE AN OFFICER ON EVERY
			FLOOR AND I'LL BE AT THE COMMAND
			CENTRE DOWNSTAIRS.

				JAR JAR
			MESA BUSTEN WIT HAPPINESS SEEIN
			YOUSA AGAIN, ANNIE. DEESA BAD
			TIMES, BOMBAD TIMES.

CAPTAIN TYPHO LEAVES.

				ANAKIN
			SHE DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNISE ME, JAR
			JAR. I THOUGHT ABOUT HER EVERY
			DAY SINCE WE PARTED... AND SHE'S
			FORGOTTEN ME COMPLETELY.

				JAR JAR
			SHESA HAPPY. HAPPIER DEN MESA
			SEE-EN HER IN LONGO TIME.

				OBI-WAN
			ANAKIN, YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THE
			NEGATIVE AGAIN. BE MINDFUL OF YOUR
			THOUGHTS. SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE US.
			NOW LETS CHECK THE SECURITY HERE.

				ANAKIN
			YES, MY MASTER.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - EVENING
THE VAST JEDI TEMPLE SITS ON AN ENDLESS FLAT PLAIN, SILHOUETTED BY A AGAINST THE TRAFFIC-FILLED SKY.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR - EVENING
MACE WINDU AND YODA WALK DOWN THE LONG HALLWAYS, SILHOUETTED BY A LIT ROOM AT THE END.

				MACE WINDU
			WHY COULDN'T WE SEE THIS ATTACK ON
			THE SENATOR?

				YODA
			MASKING THE FUTURE, IS THIS
			DISTURBANCE IN THE FORCE.

				MACE WINDU
			THE PROPECY IS COMING TRUE, THE
			DARK SIDE IS GROWING.

				YODA
			AND ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE TURNED TO
			THE DARK SIDE CAN SENSE THE
			POSSIBILITIES OF THE FUTURE. ONLY
			GOING THROUGH THE DARK SIDE CAN WE
			SEE.

				MACE WINDU
			IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS, AND THE SITH
			STILL HAVE NO SHOWN THEMSELVES.
			DO YOU THINK THEY ARE BEHIND THIS?

				YODA
			...OUT THERE, THEY ARE. A
			CERTAINTY THAT IS.

				MACE WINDU
			DO YOU THINK OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE
			WILL BE ABLE TO BRING BALANCE TO
			THE FORCE?

				YODA
			ONLY IF HE CHOOSES TO FOLLOW HIS
			DESTINY.

THERE IS A LONG SILENCE AS THEY WALK AWAY. ONLY FOOTSTEPS ARE HEARD.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
PADME IS ASLEEP IN HER BED, LIT ONLY BY THE LIGHT OF THE CITY OUTSIDE HER WINDOW COMING THROUGH THE BLINDS. ARTOO STANDS IN THE CORNER OF THE BEDROOM. HIS POWER IS OFF.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT
ANAKIN IS STANDING IN THE LIVING ROOM. HE IS IN A MEDITATIVE STATE. IT IS QUIET. WE HEAR DISTANT FOOTSTEPS IN THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT. SUDDENLY ANAKIN'S EYES POP OPEN. HIS EYES DART AROUND THE ROOM. HE REACHES FOR HIS LIGHTSABER, THEN SMILES AND PUTS IT BACK IN HIS BELT.

THE DOOR TO THE APARTMENT SLIDES OPEN, AND OBI-WAN ENTERS.

				OBI-WAN
			CAPTAIN TYPHO HAS MORE THAN ENOUGH
			MEN DOWNSTAIRS. NO ASSASSIN WILL
			TRY THAT WAY. ANY ACTIVITY UP
			HERE?

				ANAKIN
			QUIET AS A TOMB. I DON'T LIKE
			JUST WAITING HERE FOR SOMETHING TO
			HAPPEN TO HER.

OBI-WAN CHECKS A PALM-SIZED VIEW SCANNER HE HAS PULLED OUT OF HIS UTILITY BELT. IT SHOWS A SHOT OF ARTOO BY THE DOOR, BUT NO SIGN OF PADME ON THE BED.

				OBI-WAN
			WHAT'S GOING ON?

ANAKIN SHRUGS.

				ANAKIN
			SHE COVERED THAT CAMERA. I DON'T
			THINK SHE LIKED ME WATCHING HER.

				OBI-WAN
			WHAT IS SHE THINKING?

				ANAKIN
			SHE PROGRAMMED ARTOO TO WARN US IF
			THERE'S AN INTRUDER.

				OBI-WAN
			IT'S NOT AN INTRUDER I'M WORRIED
			ABOUT. THERE ARE MANY OTHER WAYS
			TO KILL A SENATOR.

				ANAKIN
			I KNOW, BUT WE ALSO WANT TO CATCH
			THIS ASSASSIN. DON'T WE, MASTER?

				OBI-WAN
			YOU'RE USING HER AS BAIT??

				ANAKIN
			IT WAS HER IDEA... NO HARM WILL
			COME TO HER. I CAN SENSE
			EVERYTHING GOING ON IN THAT ROOM.
			TRUST ME.

				OBI-WAN
			IT'S TOO RISKY... AND YOUR SENSES
			AREN'T THAT ATTUNED, YOUNG
			APPRENTICE.

				ANAKIN
			AND YOURS ARE?

				OBI-WAN
			POSSIBLY.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
AS PADME SLEEPS, A PROBE DROID APPROACHES OUTSIDE HER WINDOW. IT SENDS OUT SEVERAL SMALL ARMS THAT ATTACH TO THE WINDOW, CREATING SPARKS THAT SHUT DOWN THE SECURITY SYSTEM. THEN A LARGE ARM CUTS A SMALL HOLE IN THE GLASS. A FAINT SOUND IS HEARD AS THE SMALL SECTION OF GLASS IS REMOVED FROM THE WINDOW.

ARTOO WAKES UP, AND HIS LIGHTS GO ON. THE PROBE DROID FREEZES. ARTOO LOOKS AROUND, MAKES A PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, THEN SHUTS DOWN AGAIN. THE PROBE DROID ATTACHES A LITTLE TUBE TO THE WINDOW. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS EXIT THE TUBE, CRAWL THROUGH THE BLINDS AND HEAD TOWARD THE SLEEPING PADME.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN CONTINUE THEIR CONVERSATION IN THE MAIN ROOM OF THE APARTMENT.

				OBI-WAN
			YOU LOOK TIRED.

				ANAKIN
			I DON'T SLEEP WELL, ANYMORE.

				OBI-WAN
			BECAUSE OF YOUR MOTHER?

				ANAKIN
			I DON'T KNOW WHY I KEEP DREAMING
			ABOUT HER NOW. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
			SINCE I WAS LITTLE.

				OBI-WAN
			DREAMS PASS IN TIME.

				ANAKIN
			I'D RATHER DREAM OF PADM�. JUST
			BEING AROUND HER AGAIN IS...
			INTOXICATING.

				OBI-WAN
			MIND YOUR THOUGHTS, ANAKIN, THEY
			BETRAY YOU. YOU'VE MADE A
			COMMITMENT TO THE JEDI ORDER... A
			COMMITMENT NOT EASILY BROKEN...
			AND DON'T FORGET SHE'S A
			POLITICIAN. THEY'RE NOT TO BE
			TRUSTED.

				ANAKIN
			SHE'S NOT LIKE THE OTHERS IN THE
			SENATE, MASTER.

				OBI-WAN
			IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT
			SENATORS ARE ONLY FOCUSED ON
			PLEASING THOSE WHO FUND THEIR
			CAMPAIGNS... AND THEY ARE MORE
			THAN WILLING TO FORGET THE
			NICETIES OF DEMOCRACY TO GET THOSE
			FUNDS.

				ANAKIN
			NOT ANOTHER LECTURE, MASTER. NOT
			ON THE ECONOMICS OF POLITICS....
			IT'S TOO EARLY IN THE MORNING... AND
			BESIDES, YOU'RE GENERALISING. THE
			CHANCELLOR DOESN'T APPEAR TO
			BE CORRUPT.

				OBI-WAN
			PALPATINE'S A POLITICIAN, I'VE
			OBSERVED THAT HE IS VERY CLEVER AT
			FOLLOWING THE PASSIONS AND
			PREJUDICES OF THE SENATORS.

				ANAKIN
			I THINK HE IS A GOOD MAN. MY
			INSTINCTS ARE VERY POSITIVE
			ABOUT...

ANAKIN LOOKS STUNNED. HE LOOKS SHARPLY AT OBI-WAN

				OBI-WAN
			I SENSE IT, TOO.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
ARTOO SOUNDS AN ALARM AND SHINES A LIGHT ON THE BED. THE KOUHUNS ARE INCHES FROM PADME'S FACE. THEIR MOUTHS ARE OPEN, AND WICKED STINGER TONGUES FLICK OUT.


OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN BURST INTO THE ROOM. THE KOUHUNS STAND ON THEIR HIND LEGS AND HISS AS PADME WAKES UP. ANAKIN THROWS HIMSELF IN FRONT OF HER, WHACKING IN HALF THE DEADLY CREATURES WITH HIS LIGHTSABER.

OBI-WAN SEES THE DROID OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND RAQCES STRAIGHT AT IT, CRASHING THROUGH THE BLINDS AS HE GOES THROUGH THE WINDOW.

EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
OBI-WAN FLIES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW AND FLINGS HIMSELF AT THE PROBE DROID, GRABBING ONTO THE DEADLY MACHINE BEFORE IT CAN FLEE. THE PROBE DROID SINKS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF OBI-WAN BUT MANAGES TO STAY AFLOAT AND FLY AWAY, WITH THE JEDI HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE, A HUNDRED STORIES ABOVE THE CITY.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
ANAKIN AND PADME STARE AT THE SIGHT OF OBI-WAN BEING CARRIED OFF BY THE DROID. ANAKIN TURNS TO HER. SHE PULLS HER NIGHTDRESS AROUND HER SHOULDERS.

				ANAKIN
			STAY HERE!

CAPTAIN TYPHO, WITH TWO GUARDS AND DORME, ENTER THE ROOM AS ANAKIN DASHES OUT.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
THE PROBE DROID SENDS SEVERAL PROTECTIVE ELECTRICAL SHOCKS ACROSS ITS SURFACE, CAUSING OBI-WAN TO ALMOST LOSE HIS GRIP. AS THEY DART IN AND OUT OF THE SPEEDER TRAFFIC, OBI-WAN DISCONNECTS A WIRE ON THE BACK OF THE DROID. ITS POWER SHUTS OFF! OBI-WAN AND THE DROID DROP LIKE ROCKS. OBI-WAN REALISES THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS AND QUICKLY PUTS THE WIRE BACK. THE DROID'S SYSTEMS LIGHT UP AGAIN AND IT TAKES OFF.

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
ANAKIN CHARGES OUT OF THE BUILDING AND RUNS TO A LINE OF PARKED SPEEDERS. HE VAULTS INTO AN OPEN ONE AND TAKES OFF, GUNNING IT FAST TOWARD THE LINES OF SPEEDER TRAFFIC HIGH ABOVE.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
THE DROID BUMPS AGAINST A WALL, HOPING TO KNOCK THE JEDI LOOSE. IT MOVES BEHIND A SPEEDER AFTERBURNER TO SCORCH HIM. IT TAKESTHE JEDI WILDLY BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND FINALLY SKIMS ACROSS A ROOFTOP AS OBI-WAN IS FORCED TO LIFT HIS LEGS, TENACIOUSLY HANGING ONTO THE DROID. THE DROID HEADS FOR A DIRTY, BEAT-UP SPEEDER HIDDEN IN AN ALCOVE OF A BUILDING ABOUT TWENTY STORIES UP. WHEN THE PILOT OF THE SPEEDER, A SCRUFFY BOUNTY HUNTER CALLED ZAM WESELL, SEES THE DROID APPROACH WITH OBI-WAN HANGING ON, SHE PULLS A LONG RIFLE OUT OF THE SPEEDER AND STARTS TO FIRE AT THE JEDI. EXPLOSIONS BURST ALL AROUND OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

FINALLY, THE DROID SUFFERS A DIRECT HIT AND BLOWS UP. OBI-WAN FALLS FIFTY STORIES, UNTIL A SPEEDER DROPS DOWN NEXT TO HIM, AND HE MANAGES TO GRAB ONTO THE BACK END OF THE SPEEDER AND HAUL HIMSELF TOWARD THE COCKPIT. THE JEDI STRUGGLES TO CLIMB INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE OPEN SPEEDER AND SIT DOWN NEXT TO THE DRIVER, ANAKIN.

				ANAKIN
			THAT WAS WACKY! I ALMOST LOST YOU
			IN THE TRAFFIC.

				OBI-WAN
			WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

				ANAKIN
			OH, YOU KNOW, MASTER, I COULDN'T
			FIND A SPEEDER I REALLY LIKED,
			WITH AN OPEN COCKPIT... AND WITH
			THE RIGHT SPEED CAPABILITIES...
			AND THEN YOU KNOW I HAD TO GET A
			REALLY GONZO COLOR...

THEY ZOOM UPWARD IN HOT PURSUIT OF ZAM ASSHE FIRES OUT THE OPEN WINDOW AT THEM WITH HER LASER PISTOL.

				OBI-WAN
			IF YOU'D SPEND AS MUCH TIME
			WORKING ON YOUR SABER SKILLS AS
			YOU DO ON YOUR WIT, YOUNG PADAWAN,
			YOU WOULD RIVAL MASTER YODA AS A
			SWORDSMAN.

				ANAKIN
			I THOUGHT I ALREADY DID.

				OBI-WAN
			ONLY IN YOUR MIND, MY VERY YOUNG
			APPRENTICE. CAREFUL!! HEY, EASY!!

AS THIS CONVERSATION IS GOING ON, ANAKIN DEFTLY MOVES IN AND OUT OF THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC, ACROSS LANES, BETWEEN BUILDINGS, AND MIRACULOUSLY THROUGH A CONSTRUCTION SITE. ZAM WESELL CONTINUES FIRING AT THEM.

				ANAKIN
			SORRY, I FORGOT YOU DON'T LIKE
			FLYING, MASTER.

				OBI-WAN
			I DON'T MIND FLYING... BUT
			WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS SUICIDE!

THEY BARELY MISS A COMMUTER TRAIN

				ANAKIN
			MASTER, YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN FLYING
			SINCE BEFORE I COULD WALK. I'M VERY
			GOOD AT THIS.

				OBI-WAN
			JUST SLOW DOWN!

ZAM WESSEL AND THE JEDI RACE THROUGH A LINE OF CROSS-TRAFFIC MADE UP OF GIANT TRUCKS. THE SPEEDERS BANK SIDEWAYS AS THEY SLIDE AROUND RIGHT-ANGLE TURNS BETWEEN BUILDINGS. ZAM RACES INTO A TRAM TUNNEL.

				OBI-WAN
				(CONTINUING)
			WAIT! DON'T GO IN THERE!

ANAKIN ZOOMS INTO THE TUNNEL AFTER ZAM. THEY SEE A TRAM COMING AT THEM. THEY BRAKE, TURN AROUND, AND RACE OUT, BARELY AHEAD OF THE CHARGING COMMUTER TRANSPORT.

				OBI-WAN
				(CONTINUING)
			YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU
			DO THAT!

				ANAKIN
			SORRY, MASTER. DON'T WORRY, THIS
			GUY'S GONNA KILL HIMSELF ANY
			MINUTE NOW!

ZAM WESSEL TURNS INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC, DELIBERATELY TRYING TO THROW THE JEDI OFF. ONCOMING SPEEDERS SWERVE, TRYING TO AVOID ZAM AND THE JEDI. ZAM DOES A QUICK, TIGHT LOOP-OVER AND ENDS UP BEHIND THE JEDI. SHE IS NOW IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO FIRE AT THEM WITH HER LASER PISTOL. TO AVOID BEING HIT BY THE LASER BOLTS, ANAKIN SLAMS ON THE BRAKES AND MOVES ALONGSIDE ZAM. SHE NOW FIRES POINT-BLANK AT OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HE'S GONNA
			BLAST ME!

				ANAKIN
			RIGHT - THIS ISN'T WORKING.

ANAKIN SLIDES UNDERNEATH ZAM'S SPEEDER. THEY RACE ALONG IN TRAFFIC, ONE SPEEDER RIGHT ON TOP OF THE OTHER. THE BOUNTY HUNTER SKIMS OVER THE ROOFTOPS, CAUSING ANAKIN TO DROP BEHIND. ANAKIN GOES THROUGH HIS GEARS, ZOOMING AROUND TRAFFIC. THEY RACE AT HIGH SPEED ACROSS A WIDE, FLAT SURFACE OF THE CITY PLANET. A LARGE SPACECRAFT ALMOST COLLIDES WITH THEM AS IT ATTEMPTS TO LAND. THEY ROUND A CORNER AND CLIP A FLAG, WHICH GETS CAUGHT ON ONE OF THE FRONT AIR SCOOPS.

				OBI-WAN
			THAT WAS TOO CLOSE!

				ANAKIN
			CLEAR THAT!

				OBI-WAN
			WHAT??

				ANAKIN
			CLEAR THE FLAG! WE'RE LOSING
			POWER! HURRY!

OBI-WAN LEANS OUT OF THE SPEEDER, THEN CRAWLS OUT ONTO THE FRONT ENGINE, PULLING THE FLAG FREE OF THE SCOOP. THE SPEEDER LURCHES FORWARD WITH A SURGE OF POWER.

				OBI-WAN
			WHOOOOAAA! DON'T DO THAT! I
			DON'T  LIKE IT WHEN YOU DO THAT!

				ANAKIN
			SO SORRY, MASTER.

THEY CHASE THE BOUNTY HUNTER THROUGH A POWER REFINERY.

				OBI-WAN
			IT'S DANGEROUS NEAR THOSE POWER
			COUPLINGS! SLOW DOWN! DON'T GO
			THROUGH THERE!

HUGE ELECTRICAL BOLTS SHOOT BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS AS THE SPEEDERS PASS.

				OBI-WAN
				(CONTINUING)
			YIIII, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

				ANAKIN
			SORRY, MASTER!

				OBI-WAN
				(SARCASTICALLY)
			OH, THAT WAS GOOD...

				ANAKIN
			THAT WAS CRAZY!!!

ZAM SLIDES AROUND A CORNER SIDEWAYS, BLOCKING AN ALLEY, FIRING POINT-BLANK AS ANAKIN APPROACHES.

				ANAKIN
				(CONTINUING)
			AHH, DAMN.

				OBI-WAN
			STOP!!

				ANAKIN
			NO, WE CAN MAKE IT.

ANAKIN BARELY MISSES THE BOUNTY HUNTER'S SPEEDER AS HE DIVES UNDER IT, AND THROUGH A SMALL GAP IN THE BUILDING HITTING SEVERAL PIPES AND GOING WILDLY OUT OF CONTROL. ANAKIN STRUGGLES TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE SPEEDER, NARROWLY MISSING A CRANE, BARELY CLIPPING A PAIR OF GIANT STRUTS. A GIANT GASBALL SHOOTS UP, CAUSING ANAKIN TO SPIN AND BUMP A BUILDING, STALLING THE SPEEDER.

				OBI-WAN
			I'M CRAZY... I'M CRAZY... I'M
			CRAZY.

				ANAKIN
			BUT IT WORKED... WE MADE IT.

				OBI-WAN
				(ANGRILY)
			IT DIDN'T WORK... WE'VE STALLED!
			AND YOU ALMOST GOT US KILLED!

				ANAKIN
			I THINK WE'RE STILL ALIVE.

ANAKIN WORKS TO GET THE SPEEDER STARTED. IT QUICKLY RACES TO LIFE.

				OBI-WAN
				(VERY ANGRILY)
			IT WAS STUPID!

				ANAKIN
				(SHEEPISHLY)
			I COULD HAVE MADE IT...

				OBI-WAN
				(FURIOUS)
			BUT YOU DIDN'T!!! AND NOW WE'VE
			LOST HIM.

SUDDENLY, THERE IS AN AMBUSH. LASER BOLTS FIRE EVERYWHERE. EXPLOSIONS SURROUND THEM. THEY LOOK UP TO SEE ZAM WESSEL TAKE OFF.

				ANAKIN
			NO WE DIDN�T...

OUT OF A CLOUD OF SMOKE AND BALL OF FLAMES THE JEDI TEAR AFTER ZAM. THEY ARE SMOKING. OBI-WAN SLAPS OUT THE SMALL FIRE ON THE DASHBOARD. ZAM GOES UP AND DOWN, THROUGH CROSS-TRAFFIC. THERE IS A NEAR MISS AS A SPEEDER ALMOST HITS THEM. ZAM TURNS DOWN AND LEFT BETWEEN TWO BUILDINGS. ANAKIN PULLS UP AND TO THE RIGHT

				OBI-WAN
			WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! HE WENT
			DOWN THERE, THE OTHER WAY.

				ANAKIN
			THIS IS A SHORTCUT... I THINK.

				OBI-WAN
			WHAT DO YOU MEAN, �YOU THINK?�
			WHAT KIND OF SHORTCUT?! HE WENT
			COMPLETELY THE OTHER WAY! YOU�VE
			LOST HIM!

				ANAKIN
			MASTER, IF WE KEEP THIS CHASE
			GOING, THAT CREEP�S GONNA END UP
			DEEP FRIED. PERSONALLY, I�D VERY
			MUCH LIKE TO FIND OUT WHO IN THE
			HELL HE IS AND WHO HE�S WORKING
			FOR...

				OBI-WAN
				(SARCASTIC)
			OH, SO THAT�S WHY WE�RE GOING IN
			THE WRONG DIRECTION.

ANAKIN TURNS UP A SIDE STREET, ZOOMING UP SEVERAL SMALL PASSAGEWAYS, THEN STOPS, HOVERING ABOUT FIFTY STORIES UP.

				OBI-WAN
				(CONTINUING)
			WELL, YOU LOST HIM.

				ANAKIN
			I�M DEEPLY SORRY, MASTER.

ANAKIN LOOKS AROUND FRONT AND BACK. HE SPOTS SOMETHING. HE SEEMS TO
START COUNTING TO HIMSELF AS HE WATCHES SOMETHING BELOW APPROACH.

				ANAKIN
				(CONTINUING)
			EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT.

ANAKIN JUMPS OUT OF THE SPEEDER. OBI-WAN LOOKS DOWN AND SEES ZAM�S SPEEDER ABOUT FIVE STORIES BELOW THEM CRUISING PAST. ANAKIN MIRACULOUSLY LANDS ON TOP OF THE BOUNTY HUNTER�S SPEEDER. THE SPEEDER WOBBLES UNDER THE IMPACT. ZAM LOOKS UP AND REALISES WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

ZAM TAKES OFF, AND ANAKIN SLIDES TO THE BACK STRUT AND ALMOST SLIPS OFF, BUT MANAGES TO HANG ON. ANAKIN WORKS HIS WAY BACK TO THE SPEEDER�S COCKPIT, JUST AS ZAM STOPS SUDDENLY, AND ANAKIN FLIES FORWARD TO THE LEFT FRONT FORK. ZAM SHOOTS AT HIM WITH A LASER PISTOL. THERE IS A BLAST NEAR ANAKIN'S HAND, WHICH BREAKS OFF A PIECE OF THE SPEEDER. ANAKIN SLIDES TO THE RIGHT FORK OF THE SPEEDER, WHERE ZAM CAN�T REACH HIM. HE SCRAMBLES TO THE TOP, HOLDING ONTO AN AIR SCOOP.

OBI-WAN HAS JUMPED INTO THE DRIVER�S SEAT OF HIS SPEEDER AND IS DEFTLY GAINING ON THE ROGUE SPEEDER. THE TWO SPEEDERS DIVE THROUGH ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND THEN THROUGH CROSS TRAFFIC. FINALLY, ANAKIN IS ABLE TO GET HOLD OF HIS LIGHTSABER AND STARTS TO CUT HIS WAY THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE SPEEDER. ZAM TAKES OUT HER LASER PISTOL AND STARTS FIRING AT THE HELPLESS JEDI, KNOCKING THE SWORD OUT OF HIS HAND. OBI-WAN RACES UNDER THE SPEEDER AND CATCHES THE JEDI WEAPON IN THE PASSENGER�S SEAT.

ANAKIN STICKS HIS HAND INTO THE COCKPIT AND, USING THE FORCE, PULLS THE GUN OUT OF ZAM�S HAND. SHE GRABS THE JEDI�S HAND, AND THEY STRUGGLE FOR THE WEAPON. IT GOES OFF, BLOWING A HOLE IN THE FLOOR OF THE SPEEDER. THE SPEEDER CAREENS WILDLY OUT OF CONTROL. ZAM STRUGGLES TO PULL THE SPEEDER OUT OF IT�S NOSE DIVE. OBI-WAN GETS SLOWED DOWN BY TRAFFIC AND LOSES SIGHT OF THE BOUNTY HUNTER�S SPEEDER.

JUST AS THE DRAGSTER IS ABOUT TO NOSE DIVE INTO THE GROUND, ZAM PULLS IT OUT, AND IT SLIDES HARD ON THE PAVEMENT IN A SHOWER OF SPARKS. ANAKIN GOES FLYING INTO THE STREET.

EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT
ZAM EXITS THE CRASHED SPEEDER AND RUNS. ANAKIN PICKS HIMSELF UP OFF THE PAVEMENT AND RUNS DOWN THE VERY CROWDED STREET.

IT'S THE SEEDY UNDERBELLY OF THE CITY. BROKEN SIDEWALKS, GARISH LIGHTS REFLECTED ON THE FILTHY PUDDLES. IT'S PRETTY CROWDED WITH VARIOUS ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, AND THE OCCASIONAL GROUP OF UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.

ANAKIN BARGES INTO SEVERAL OF THEM AS HE CHASES AFTER THE FLEEING ZAM. HE LOSES THE BOUNTY HUNTER IN THE CROWD, THEM SEES HIM AGAIN. THE YOUNG JEDI IS HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THROUGH THE CROWD.

AHEAD, ZAM TURNS IN THROUGH A DOOR AND DISAPPEARS.

A NIGHTCLUB SIGHS IS FLASHING OVER THE DOOR. ANAKIN IS JUST ABOUT TO FOLLOW ZAM WHEN THERE IS A SUDDEN SWIRL OF LITTER FROM DOWNTHRUSTERS. PEOPLE START MOVING OUT OF THE WAY, AND THE OPEN SPEEDER LANDS IN THE STREET BESIDE HIM. OBI-WAN GETS OUT AND WALKS OVER, HOLDING OUT ANAKIN'S LIGHTSABER.

				OBI-WAN
			ANAKIN!

				ANAKIN
			SHE WENT INTO THAT CLUB, MASTER.

				OBI-WAN
			PATIENCE.

OBI-WAN HANDS ANAKIN THE LIGHTSABER.

				OBI-WAN
			 	(CONTINUING)
			HERE. NEXT TIME TRY NOT TO LOSE IT.

				ANAKIN
			SORRY, MASTER.

ANAKIN REACHES FOR THE LIGHTSABER, BUT OBI-WAN HOLDS IT BACK.

				OBI-WAN
			A JEDI'S SABER IS HIS MOST
			PRECIOUS POSSESSION.

				ANAKIN
			YES, MASTER.

HE REACHES FOR THE LIGHTSABER, OBI-WAN PULLS IT BACK.

				OBI-WAN
			HE MUST KEEP IT WITH HIM AT ALL
			TIMES.

				ANAKIN
			I KNOW, MASTER.

				OBI-WAN
			THIS WEAPON IS YOUR LIFE!

				ANAKIN
			I'VE HEARD THIS LESSON BEFORE...

OBI-WAN FINALLY HOLDS OUT THE LIGHTSABER AND ANAKIN GRABS IT.

				OBI-WAN
			BUT, YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED ANYTHING,
			ANAKIN.

				ANAKIN
			I TRY, MASTER.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN ENTER THE NIGHTCLUB BAR, AND EVERYONE STARES AT THEM

				OBI-WAN
			WHY DO I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO BE
			THE DEATH OF ME?!

				ANAKIN
			DON'T SAY THAT MASTER... YOU'RE
			THE CLOSEST THING I HAVE TO A
			FATHER... I LOVE YOU. I DON'T WANT
			TO CAUSE YOU PAIN.

				OBI-WAN
			THEN WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME?!

				ANAKIN
			I WILL. I'LL DO BETTER, I PROMISE.

				OBI-WAN
			DO YOU SEE HIM HIM?

				ANAKIN
			I THINK HE'S A SHE...

				OBI-WAN
			THEN BE EXTRA CAREFUL...
				(NODS TO A ROOM)
			CHECK IT OUT.

OBI-WAN GOES AWAY.

				ANAKIN
			WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MASTER?

				OBI-WAN
			TO GET A DRINK.

OBI-WAN HEADS FOR THE BAR. ANAKIN BLINKS IN SURPRISE, THEN MOVES INTO THE ROOM, WHERE ALIEN FACES LOOK BACK AT HIM WITH HOSTILITY, SUSPICION, AND INVITATION AS HE MOVES AMONG THE TABLES. OBI-WAN ARRIVES AT THE BAR. HE SIGNALS THE BARMAN.

CLOSE - SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM A HAND MOVES TO A PISTOL IN ITS HOLSTER AND UNSNAPS THE SAFETY CATCH. AT THE BAR, A GLASS IS PLACED IN FROM OF OBI-WAN. A DRINK IS POURED. HE LIFTS THE GLASS.

				ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
			WANNA BUY SOME DEATH STICKS?

OBI-WAN LOOKS AT HIM. HE MOVES HIS FINGERS SLIGHTLY.

				OBI-WAN
			YOU DON'T WANT TO SELL ME DEATH-
			STICKS.

				ELAN
			I DON'T WANT TO SELL YOU DEATH-
			STICKS.

OBI-WAN MOVES HIS FINGERS.

				OBI-WAN
			YOU WANT TO GO HOME AND RETHINK
			YOUR LIFE.

				ELAN
			I WANT TO GO HOME AND RETHINK MY
			LIFE.

HE LEAVES. OBI-WAN LIFTS THE DRINK AND TOSSES IT BACK.

CLOSE. THE GUN IS DRAWN FROM ITS HOLSTER AND HELD DOWN OUT OF SIGHT. THE BOUNTY HUNTER STARTS TO MOVE TOWARD THE BAR.

ANAKIN CHECKS OUT ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN SIGNALS FOR ANOTHER DRINK. THE GUN MOVES TOWARD HIS UNSUSPECTING BACK.

THE DRINK IS POURED. OBI-WAN REACHES FOR IT. THE GUN IS RAISED TO AIM DIRECTLY AT HIS BACK, AND SUDDENLY OBI-WAN TURNS FAST. HIS LIGHTSABER FLASHES. THERE IS A SHRILL SCREAM AND ZAM'S ARM HITS THE FLOOR. THE GUN DROPS FROM ITS TWITCHING FINGERS. BLOOD SPREADS.

THE ROOM IS SILENT. ALIENS RISE MENACINGLY FROM THEIR SEATS, AND ANAKIN IS SUDDENLY AT OBI-WAN'S SIDE, HIS LIGHTSABER GLOWING.

				ANAKIN
			EASY... OFFICIAL BUSINESS. GO
			BACK TO YOUR DRINKS.

SLOWLY, THE ALIENS SIT. CONVERSATION RESUMES. ONSTAGE, THE PERFORMERS PICK UP THEIR ROUTINE. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN LIFT ZAM AND CARRY HER OUT.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN CARRY ZAM INTO THE ALLEY AND LOWER HER TO THE GROUND. OBI-WAN ATTENDS TO HER WOUNDED SHOULDER. SHE STARES UP HATEFULLY AT ANAKIN. SHE WINCES IN PAIN, THEN NODS.

				OBI-WAN
			DO YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS YOU WERE
			TRYING TO KILL?

				ZAM WESSEL
			THE SENATOR FROM NABOO.

				OBI-WAN
			WHO HIRED YOU?

ZAM GLARES AT OBI-WAN.

				ZAM WESSEL
			IT WAS JUST A JOB.

				ANAKIN
			TELL US!

				ZAM WESSEL
			THAT SENATOR'S GONNA DIE SOON
			ANYWAY, AND THE NEXT ONE WON'T
			MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID...

				OBI-WAN
			THIS WOUND'S GOING TO NEED
			TREATMENT.

				ANAKIN
			WHO HIRED YOU? TELL US... TELL US
			NOW!

ZAM GLARES HATEFULLY.

				ZAM
			IT WAS A BOUNTY HUNTER CALLED...

THERE IS A SUDDEN FTZZZ SOUND. ZAM TWITCHES. SHE BLINKS IN SURPRISE AND DIES.

THERE IS A WEOOSH FROM ABOVE. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN LOOK UP YO SEE AN ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN TAKING OFF FROM A ROOF HIGH ABOVE. OBI-WAN LOOKS DOWN AT ZAM. HE TOUCHES HER NECK AND PULLS OUT A SMALL, WICKED-LOOKING DART.

				OBI-WAN
			TOXIC DART...

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - DAY
ANAKIN AND JAR JAR STAND NEAR THE DOOR OF THE ANTEROOM TO PADME'S
BEDROOM. PADME AND DORME MOVE ABOUT PACKING LUGGAGE.

				PADM�
			REPRESENTATIVE BINKS. I KNOW I CAN
			COUNT ON YOU.

				JAR JAR
			YOUSA BETCHEN MESA BOTTUMS.

				PADM�
			WHAT?!

				JAR JAR
				(COUGHS, RECOVERS)
			OH, PARDONE-AY, SENATOR. I MEAN,
			I AM HONOURED TO ACCEPT THIS HEAVY
			BURDEN. I TAKE ON THIS
			RESPONSIBILITY WITH DEEP HUMILITY
			TINGED WITH AN OVERWHELMING PRIDE.
				(POMPOUSLY)
			IT IS NOT EVERY DAY THAT I AM
			CALLED UPON TO...

PADME KISSES HIM ON THE CHEEK AND GIVES HIM A HUG. JAR JAR TURNS RED.

				PADM�
			YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND, JAR JAR. I
			DON'T WISH TO HOLD YOU UP. I'M
			SURE YOU HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO DO.

				JAR JAR
			OF COURSE, M'LADY.

JAR JAR BOWS AND GOES OUT. AS HE PASSES ANAKIN, HE FLASHES A DAZZLING SMILE... PADME IS IN A VERY BAD MOOD.

				PADM�
			I DO NOT LIKE THIS IDEA OF HIDING.

				ANAKIN
			DON'T WORRY. NOW THAT THE COUNCIL
			HAS ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION, IT
			WON'T TAKE MASTER OBI-WAN LONG TO
			FIND THAT BOUNTY HUNTER.

				PADM�
				(FRUSTRATED)
			I HAVEN'T WORKED FOR A YEAR TO
			DEFEAT THE "MILITARY CREATION ACT"
			NOT TO BE HERE WHEN ITS FATE IS
			DECIDED.

				ANAKIN
			SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO LET GO OF OUR
			PRIDE AND DO WHAT IS REQUESTED OF
			US.

				PADM�
			PRIDE?!? ANNIE, YOU'RE YOUNG, AND
			YOU DON'T HAVE A VERY FIRM GRIP ON
			POLITICS. I SUGGEST YOU RESERVE
			YOUR OPINIONS FOR SOME OTHER TIME.

				ANAKIN
			SORRY, M'LADY. I WAS ONLY TRYING
			TO...

				PADM�
			ANNIE! NO!

				ANAKIN
			PLEASE DON'T CALL ME THAT.

				PADM�
			WHAT?

				ANAKIN
			ANNIE...

				PADM�
			I'VE ALWAYS CALLED YOU THAT... IT
			IS YOUR NAME, ISN'T IT?

				ANAKIN
			IT'S ANAKIN. WHEN YOU SAY ANNIE
			IT'S LIKE I'M STILL A LITTLE
			BOY... AND I'M NOT.

				PADM�
			I'M SORRY, ANAKIN. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
			TO DENY YOU'VE...
				(LOOKS HIM OVER)
			...THAT YOU'VE GROWN UP.

PADME SMILES AT ANAKIN. HE BECOMES A LITTLE SHY.

				ANAKIN
			MASTER OBI-WAN MANAGES NOT TO SEE
			IT...

				PADM�
			MENTORS HAVE A WAY OF SEEING MORE
			OF OUR FAULTS THAN WE WOULD LIKE.
			IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE GROW.

				ANAKIN
			DON'T GET ME WRONG... OBI-WAN IS
			A GREAT MENTOR. AS WISE AS MASTER
			YODA AND AS POWERFUL AS MASTER
			WINDU. I AM TRULY THANKFUL TO BE
			HIS APPRENTICE. ONLY... ALTHOUGH
			I'M A PADAWAN LEARNER, IN SOME
			WAYS... A LOT OF WAYS... I'M AHEAD
			OF HIM. I'M READY FOR THE TRIALS.
			I KNOW I AM! HE KNOWS IT TOO. HE
			BELIEVES I'M TOO UNPREDICTABLE...
			OTHER JEDI MY AGE HAVE GONE
			THROUGH THE TRIALS AND MADE IT...
			I KNOW I STARTED MY TRAINING
			LATE... BUT HE WON'T LET ME MOVE
			ON.

				PADM�
			THAT MUST BE FRUSTRATING.

				ANAKIN
			IT'S WORSE... HE'S OVERLY
			CRITICAL. HE NEVER LISTENS! HE
			JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND! IT'S NOT
			FAIR!

PADME CANNOT SURPRESS A LAUGH. SHE SHAKES HER HEAD.

				PADM�
			I'M SORRY... YOU SOUNDED EXACTLY
			LIKE THAT LITTLE BOY I ONCE KNEW,
			WHEN HE DIDN'T GET HIS WAY.

				ANAKIN
			I'M NOT WHINING! I'M NOT.

PADME JUST SMILES AT HIM. DORME LAUGHS IN THE BACKGROUND.

				PADM�
			I DIDN'T SAY IT TO HURT YOU.

				ANAKIN
			I KNOW...

THERE IS A BRIEF SILENCE. PADME COMES OVER TO ANAKIN.

				PADME
			ANAKIN...

THEY LOOK INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES FOR THE FIRST TIME.

				PADM�
				(CONTINUING)
			DON'T TRY TO GROW UP TOO FAST.

				ANAKIN
			I AM GROWN UP. YOU SAID IT
			YOURSELF.

ANAKIN LOOKS DEEP INTO PADME'S EYES.

				PADM�
			PLEASE DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

				ANAKIN
			WHY NOT?

				PADM�
			BECAUSE I CAN SEE WHAT YOU'RE
			THINKING.

				ANAKIN
				(LAUGHING)
			AHH... SO, YOU HAVE JEDI POWERS
			TOO?

DORME IS WATCHING WITH CONCERN.

				PADM�
			IT MAKES ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

				ANAKIN
			SORRY, M'LADY.

ANAKIN BACKS AWAY AS PADME TURNS AND GOES BACK TO HER PACKING.

EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
A SMALL BUS SPEEDS TOWARD THE MASSIVE FREIGHTER DOCKS OF CORUSCANT'S INDUSTRIAL AREA. THE SPACEPORT IS BUSTLING WITH ACTIVITY. TRANSPORTS OF VARIOUS SIZES MOVES SUPPLIES AND PASSENGERS AS GIANT FLOATING CRANES LIFT CARGO OUT OF STARSHIPS. THE BUS STOPS BEFORE A HUGE INTERGALACTIC FREIGHTER STARSHIP. IT PARKS IN THE SHADOWS OF AN OVERHANG.

INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
ANAKIN AND PADME, DRESSED IN OUTLAND PEASANT OUTFITS, GET UP AND HEAD FOR THE DOOR WHERE CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME AND OBI-WAN ARE WAITING TO HAND THEM THEIR LUGGAGE. DORME IS DRESSED TO LOOK LIKE SENATOR AMIDALA.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			BE SAFE, M'LADY.

				PADM�
			THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. TAKE GOOD
			CARE OF DORME... THE THREAT'S ON
			YOU TWO NOW.

				DORME
			HE'LL BE SAFE WITH ME.

THEY LAUGH, AND PADME EMBRACES HER FAITHFUL HANDMAIDEN. DORME START TO WEEP.

				PADM�
			YOU'LL BE FINE.

				DORME
			IT'S NOT ME, M'LADY. I WORRY
			ABOUT YOU. WHAT IF THEY REALISE
			I'M NOT YOU?

				PADM�
				(LOOKS TO ANAKIN)
			THEN MY JEDI PROTECTOR WILL HAVE
			TO PROVE HOW GROWN UP HE IS.

DORME AND PADME SMILE. ANAKIN FROWNS AS OBI-WAN PULLS HIM ASIDE.

				OBI-WAN
			ANAKIN, YOU STAY PUT ON NABOO.
			DO NOT ATTRACT ANY ATTENTION. DO
			ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WITHOUT
			CHECKING IN WITH ME OR THE COUNCIL.

				ANAKIN
			YES, MASTER.

				OBI-WAN
				(TO PADME)
			I WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS
			PLOT QUICKLY, M'LADY. YOU'LL BE
			BACK HERE IN NO TIME.

				PADM�
			I WILL BE MOST GRATEFUL FOR YOUR
			SPEED, MASTER JEDI.

				ANAKIN
			TIME TO GO.

				PADM�
			I KNOW.

PADME GIVES DORME A LAST HUG. ANAKIN PICKS UP THE LUGGAGE, AND THE TWO PEASANTS EXIT THE SPEEDER BUS, WHERE ARTOO IS WAITING FOR THEM.

				OBI-WAN
			MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.

				ANAKIN
			MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU, MASTER.

THEY HEAD OFF TOWARD THE GIANT STARFREIGHTER.

				PADM�
			SUDDENLY, I'M AFRAID...

				ANAKIN
			I'M KINDA SCARED TOO. THIS IS MY
			FIRST ASSIGNMENT ON MY OWN.

				PADM�
			THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT...
			WE HAVE ARTOO WITH US.

THE TWO LAUGH.

OBI-WAN AND CAPTAIN TYPHO WATCH ANAKIN AND PADME DISAPPEAR INTO THE
VASTNESS OF THE SPACEPORT WITH ARTOO TRUNDLING ALONG BEHIND THEM.

				OBI-WAN
			I HOPE HE DOESN'T TRY ANYTHING
			FOOLISH.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I'D BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HER
			DOING SOMETHING, THAN HIM.

EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS - CORUSCANT - DAY
THE FREIGHTER SLOWLY TAKES OFF FROM THE HUGE DOCKS AREA OF CORUSCANT. IT SOON MOVES INTO THE CROWDED SKIES.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAY
FROM HIGH ABOVE, LIGHT STREAMS DOWN FROM THE LOFTY CEILINGS. OBI-WAN CROSSES THE FLOOR OF THE GREAT HALLWAY, HEAADING FOR THE ANALYSIS ROOMS.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN WALKS PAST SEVERAL GLASS CUBICLES WHERE WORK IS GOING ON. HE COMES TO AN EMPTY ONE AND SITS DOWN IN FRONT OF A CONSOLE. A PK-4 ANALYSIS DROID COMES TO LIFE. A TRAY SLIDES OUT OF THE CONSOLE.

				PK-4
			PLACE THE SUBJECT FOR ANALYSIS ON
			THE SENSOT TRAY, PLEASE.

OBI-WAN PUTS THE DART ONTO THE TRAYM WHICH RETRACTS INTO THE CONSOLE. THE DROID ACTIVATES THE SYSTEM, AND A SCREEN LIGHTS UP IN FROM OF OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			IT'S A TOXIC DART. I NEED TO KNOW
			WHERE IT CAME FROM AND WHO MADE IT.

				PK-4
			ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.

DIAGRAMS AND .... APPEAR ON THE SCREEM, SCROLLING PAST AT GREAT SPEED. OBI-WAN WATCHES AS THE SCREEN GOES BLANK. THEY TRAY SLIDES OUT.

				PK-4
				(CONTINUING)
			AS YOU CAN SEE ON YOUR SCREEN,
			SUBJECT WEAPON DOES NOT EXIST IN
			ANY KNOWN CULTURE. MARKINGS
			CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED. PROBABLT
			SELF-MADE BY A WARRIOR NOT
			ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KNOWN SOCIETY.

				OBI-WAN
			EXCUSE ME? COULD YOU TRY AGAIN
			PLEASE?

				PK-4
			MASTER JEDI, OUR RECORDS ARE VERY
			THOROUGH. THEY COVER EIGHT
			PERCENT OF THE GALAXY. IF I CAN'T
			TELL YOU WHERE IT CAME FROM,
			NOBODY CAN.

OBI-WAN PICKS UP THE DART AND LOOKS AT IT, THEN LOOKS TO THE DROID.

				OBI-WAN
			THANKS FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE! YOU
			MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS
			OUT, BUT I THINK I KNOW SOMEONE
			WHO MIGHT.

EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER
THE MASSIVE, SLOW-MOVING FREIGHTER SUDDENLY ZOOMS AWAY INTO LIGHTSPEED.

INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY
THE GREAT, GLOOMY HOLD IS CROWDED WITH EMIGRANTS AND THEIR BELONGINGS. TO ONE SIDE ARTOO IS COMING TO THE HEAD OF A FOOD LINE, WHERE SERVERS ARE LADLING OUT BOWLS OF MUSH. ARTOO HOLDS TWO BOWLS.

				SERVER
			KEEP MOVING! KEEP MOVING!

ARTOO SLIPS TUBE INTO A TUB OF MUSH AND SUCKS UP A LARGE QUANTITY. WITH ONE OF HIS LITTLE CLAW-ARMS, HE GRABS SEVERAL CHUNKS OF SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE BROWN BREAD. A SERVER SEES HIM.

				FOOD SERVER
				(CONTINUING)
			HEY! NO DROIDS!

ARTOO TAKES ONE LAST BIG SUCK AND HEADS AWAY FROM THE FOOD LINE. THE SERVER SHOUTS AFTER HIM ANGRILY. THE LITTLE DROID MOVES PAST GROUPS OF EATING OR SLEEPING EMIGRANTS AND COMES TO WHERE ANAKIN IS SOUND ASLEEP. THE YOUNG JEDI SEEMS TO BE HAVING A NIGHTMARE. HE IS VERY RESTLESS.

				ANAKIN
			NO, NO, MOM, NO...

HE IS SWEATING. PADME LEANS OVER TO WIPE SOME OF THE SWEAT FROM HIS FOREHEAD. HE WAKES UP WITH A START, THEN REALISES WHERE HE IS. PADME SIMPLY LOOKS AT HIM. HE STARES BACK, SOMEWHAT CONFUSED. ARTOO FILLS UP TWO BOWLS WITH MUSH.

				ANAKIN
				(CONTINUING)
			WHAT?

				PADM�
			YOU SEEMED TO BE HAVING A
			NIGHTMARE.

ANAKIN LOOKS AT PADME A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY, TRYING TO SEE IF HE HAS REVEALED ANY OF HIS SECRETS. SHE HANDS HIM A BOWL OF MUSH AND BREAD.

				PADM�
				(CONTINUING)
			ARE YOU HUNGRY?

				ANAKIN
			THANK YOU.

				PADM�
			WE WENT INTO LIGHTSPEED A WHILE
			AGO.

ANAKIN LOOKS INTO PADME'S EYES.

				ANAKIN
			I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING NABOO
			AGAIN. I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT EVERY
			DAY SINCE I LEFT. IT'S BY FAR THE
			MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE I'VE EVER
			SEEN...

PADME IS A LITTLE UNNERVED BY HIS INTENSE STARE.

				PADM�
			YOU WERE JUST A LITTLE BOY THEN.
			IT MAY NOT BE AS YOU REMEMBER IT;
			TIME CHANGES YOUR PERCEPTION.

				ANAKIN
			I THINK TIME HAS GIVEN ME MUCH
			MORE MATURE FEELINGS TO ENHANCE MY
			PERCEPTION.

				PADM�
			IT MUST BE DIFFICULT HAVING SWORN
			YOUR LIFE TO THE JEDI... NOT BEING
			ABLE TO VISIT THE PLACES YOU
			LIKE... OR DO THE THINGS YOU
			LIKE...

				ANAKIN
			OR BE WITH THE PEOPLE I LOVE.

				PADM�
			ARE YOU ALLOWED TO LOVE? I
			THOUGHT THAT WAS FORBIDDEN FOR A
			JEDI.

				ANAKIN
			ATTACHMENT IS FORBIDDEN.
			POSSESSION IS FORBIDDEN.
			COMPASSION, WHICH I WOULD DEFINE
			AS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, IS CENTRAL
			TO A JEDI'S LIFE, SO YOU MIGHT SAY
			WE'RE ENCOURAGED TO LOVE.

				PADM�
			YOU HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH

				ANAKIN
			YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT. YOU'RE
			EXACTLY THE WAY I REMEMBER YOU IN
			MY DREAMS. I DOUBT IF NABOO HAS
			CHANGED MUCH EITHER.

				PADM�
			IT HASN'T...

				ANAKIN
			I CAN'T WAIT TO BREATHE THE SWEET
			BREEZE THAT COMES OFF THE ROLLING
			HILLS. WHENEVER I TRY TO
			VISUALISE THE FORCE, THOSE HILLS
			ARE WHAT I SEE.

ANAKIN LOOKS AT PADME WHEN HE SAYS THIS.

				ANAKIN
				(CONTINUING)
			I LOVE NABOO.

THERE IS AN AWKWARD MOMENT.

				PADM�
				(CHANGING THE SUBJECT)
			WERE YOU DREAMING ABOUT YOU
			MOTHER EARLIER, WEREN'T YOU?

				ANAKIN
			YES... I LEFT TATOOINE SO LONG
			AGO, MY MEMORY OF HER IS FADING.
			I DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT. RECENTLY
			I'VE BEEN SEEING HER IN MY
			DREAMS... VIVID DREAMS... SCARY
			DREAMS. I WORRY ABOUT HER.

PADME GIVES ANAKIN A SYMPATHETIC LOOK.

EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING
OBI-WAN WALKS DOWN THE STREET. IT IS A PRETTY TOUGH PART OF TOWN. OLD BUILDINGS, WAREHOUSES, BEAT UP SPEEDERS AND TRANSPORTER RIGS OCCASIONAL "SHINY FREIGHTERS" HISSING THROUGH.

OBI-WAN COMES TO A KIND OF ALIEN DINER. ON THE STEAMED-UP WINDOWA IT SAYS "DEX'S DINER" IN ALIEN LETTERING. HE GOES INSIDE.

INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING
A YOUNG WAITRESS, HERMIONE BAGWA, IS WIPING OFF A BOOTH TABLETOP. THERE IS A COUNTER WITH STOOLS AND A LINE OF BOOTHS ALONG THE WALL BY THE WINDOW. A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE EATING - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS ETC. HERMIONE LOOKS UP AS OBI-WAN COMES IN.

				HERMIONE
			CAN I HELP YA?

				OBI-WAN
			I'M LOOKING FOR DEXTER.

HERMIONE'S EYES NARROW.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			WADDYA WANT HIM FOR?

				OBI-WAN
			HE'S NOT IN TROUBLE. IT'S
			PERSONAL.

HERMIONE STARES AT OBI-WAN. THERE IS A BRIEF PAUSE. THEN SHE GOES TO THE OPEN SERVING HATCH BEHIND THE COUNTER.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			SOMEONE TO SEE YA, HONEY
				(LOWERING HER VOICE)
			A JEDI, BY THE LOOKS OF HIM.

STEAM BILLOWS OUT FROM THE KITCHEN HATCH BEHIND THE COUNTER AS A HUGE HEAD POKES THROUGH.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			OBI-WAN!

				OBI-WAN
			HEY, DEX.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			TAKE A SEAT! BE RIGHT WITH YA!

OBI-WAN SITS IN A BOOTH.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			YOU WANT A CUP OF ARDEES?

				OBI-WAN
			THANK YOU.

HERMIONE MOVES OFF AS THE DOOR TO THE COUNTER OPENS AND DEXTER JETTSTER APPEARS. HE IS BIG - BALD AND SWEATY, OLD AND ALIEN. NOT SOMEONE TO TANGLE WITH. HE ARRIVES, BEAMING HUGELY.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			HEY, OL' BUDDY!

				OBI-WAN
			HEY, DEX.

DEXTER EASES HIMSELF INTO THE SEAT OPPOSITE OBI-WAN. HE CAN JUST MAKE IT. HERMIONE SETS TWO MUGS OF STEAMING ARDEES IN FROM OF THEM.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			SO, MY FRIEND. WHAT CAN I DO FOR
			YA?

				OBI-WAN
			YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT THIS IS.

OBI-WAN PLACES THE DART ON THE TABLE BETWEEN THEM. DEX'S EYES WIDEN. HE PUTS DOWN HIS MUG.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			WELL, WHATTAYA KNOW...

DEXTER PICKS UP THE DART DELICATELY BETWEEN HIS PUFFY FINGERS AND PEERS AT IT.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
				(CONTINUING)
			I AIN'T SEEN ONE OF THESE SINCE I
			WAS PROSPECTING ON SUBTERREL
			BEYOND THE OUTER RIM!

				OBI-WAN
			DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM?

DEXTER GRINS. HE PUTS THE DART DOWN BETWEEN THEM.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			THIS BABY BELONGS TO THEM CLONERS.
			WHAT YOU GOT HERE IS A KAMINO
			KYBERDART.

				OBI-WAN
			KAMINO KYBERDART... I WONDER WHY
			IT DIDN'T SHOW UP IN ANY ANALYSIS
			ARCHIVE.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			IT'S THESE FUNNY LITTLE CUTS ON
			THE SIDE GIVE IT AWAY...
			THOSE ANALYSIS DROIDS YOU'VE GOT
			OVER THERE ONLY FOCUS ON SYMBOLS,
			YOU KNOW. I SHOULD THINK YOU JEDI
			WOULD HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR THE
			DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE AND
			WISDOM.

				OBI-WAN
			WELL, DEX, IF DROIDS COULD THINK, WE
			WOULDN'T BE HERE, WOULD WE?
				(LAUGHING)
			KAMINO... DOESN'T SOUND FAMILIAR.
			IS IT PART OF THE REPUBLIC?

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			NO, IT'S BEYOND THE OUTER RIM.
			I'D SAY ABOUT TWELVE PARSECS
			OUTSIDE THE RISHI MAZE, TOWARD THE
			SOUTH. IT SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND,
			EVEN FOR THOSE DROIDS IN YOUR
			ARCHIVE TO FIND. THOSE KAMINOANS
			KEEP TO THEMSELVES. THEY'RE
			CLONERS. DAMNED GOOD ONES, TOO.

OBI-WAN THEN PICKS UP THE DART, HOLDING IT MIDWAY BETWEEN THEM.

				OBI-WAN
			CLONERS? ARE THEY FRIENDLY?

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			IT DEPENDS.

				OBI-WAN
			ON WHAT, DEX?

DEXTER GRINS.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			ON HOW GOOD YOUR MANNERS ARE...
			AND HOW BIG YOUR POCKETBOOK IS...

EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY
THE STARFREIGHTER LANDS IN THE GIANT PORT CITY OF THEED.

PADME, ANAKIN AND ARTOO ARE AMONG THE EMIGRANTS STREAMING FROM THE STARFREIGHTER AND INTO THE VAST DOCKING AREA. THEY EXIT ONTO THE MAIN PLAZA.

EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON
THE SPEEDER BUS PULLS UP AND STOPS. PADME, ANAKIN, AND ARTOO GET OUT. THE GREAT COURTYARD STRETCHES OUT BEFORE THEM, AND THEY SEE THE ROSE-COLORED DOME OF THE PALACE ON THE FAR SIDE. ARTOO WHISTLES. THEY PICK UP THEIR GEAR AND START TO CROSS THE COURTYARD. ARTOO TRUNDLES BEHIND THEM.

				ANAKIN
			IF I GREW UP HERE, I DON'T THINK
			I'D EVER LEAVE.

				PADM�
				(LAUGHING)
			I DOUBT THAT.

				ANAKIN
			NO, REALLY. WHEN I STARTED MY
			TRAINING, I WAS VERY HOMESICK AND
			VERY LONELY. THIS CITY AND MY MOM
			WERE THE ONLY PLEASANT THINGS I
			HAD TO THINK ABOUT... THE PROBLEM
			WAS, THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT MY
			MOM, THE WORSE I FELT. BUT I
			WOULD FEEL BETTER IF I THOUGHT
			ABOUT THE PALACE - THE WAY IT
			SHIMMERS IN THE SUNLIGHT - THE WAY
			THE AIR ALWAYS SMELLS OF FLOWERS...

				PADM�
			...AND THE SOFT SOUND OF THE
			DISTANT WATERFALLS. THE FIRST
			TIME I SAW THE CAPITAL, I WAS VERY
			YOUNG... I'D NEVER SEEN A
			WATERFALL BEFORE. I THOUGH THEY
			WERE SO BEAUTIFUL... I NEVER
			DREAMED ONE DAY I'D LIVE IN THE
			PALACE.

				ANAKIN
			WELL, TELL ME, DID YOU DREAM OF
			POWER AND POLITICS WHEN YOU WERE
			A LITTLE GIRL?

				PADM�
				(LAUGHING)
			NO! THAT WAS THE LAST THING I
			THOUGHT OF. MY DREAM WAS TO HELP
			IN THE "REFUGEE RELIEF MOVEMENT."
			I NEVER THOUGHT OF RUNNING FOR
			ELECTED OFFICE. BUT THE MORE
			HISTORY I STUDIED, THE MORE I
			REALISED HOW MUCH GOOD POLITICIANS
			COULD DO. SO WHEN I WAS EIGHT, I
			JOINED THE "APPRENTICE
			LEGISLATORS", THEN LATER ON BECAME
			A SENATORIAL ADVISOR, WITH SUCH A
			PASSION THAT, BEFORE I KNEW IT, I
			WAS ELECTED QUEEN. PARTLY BECAUSE
			I SCORED SO HIGH ON MY EDUCATION
			CERTIFICATE, BUT FOR THE MOST PART
			IT WAS MY CONVICTION THAT REFORM
			WAS POSSIBLE. I WASN'T THE
			YOUNGEST QUEEN EVER ELECTED, BUT
			NOW THAT I THINK BACK ON IT, I'M
			NOT SURE I WAS OLD ENOUGH. I'M NOT
			SURE I WAS READY.

				ANAKIN
			THE PEOPLE YOU SERVED THOUGHT YOU
			DID A GOOD JOB. I HEARD THEY
			TRIED TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION SO
			YOU COULD STAY IN OFFICE.

				PADM�
			POPULAR RULE IS NOT DEMOCRACY,
			ANNIE. IT GIVES THE PEOPLE WHAT
			THEY WANT, NOT WHAT THEY NEED.
			AND, TRUTHFULLY, I WAS RELIEVED
			WHEN MY TWO TERMS WERE UP. SO
			WERE MY PARENTS. THEY WORRIED
			ABOUT ME DURING THE BLOCKADE AND
			COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT ALL TO BE
			OVER. ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING TO
			HAVE A FAMILY BY NOW... MY
			SISTERS HAVE THE MOST AMAZING,
			WONDERFUL KIDS... BUT WHEN THE
			QUEEN ASKED ME TO SERVE AS
			SENATOR, I COULDN'T REFUSE HER.

				ANAKIN
			I AGREE! I THINK THE REPUBLIC
			NEEDS YOU... I'M GLAD YOU CHOSE
			TO SERVE. I FEEL THINGS ARE GOING
			TO HAPPEN IN OUR GENERATION THAT
			WILL CHANGE THE GALAXY IN PROFOUND
			WAYS.

				PADM�
			I THINK SO TOO.

ANAKIN AND PADME WALK TOWARD THE PALACE. ARTOO CONTINUES TO FOLLOW.

INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON
QUEN JAMILLIA IS SEATED ON THE THRONE, FLANKED BY SIO BIBBLE AND A COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS STAND CLOSE BY, AND GUARDS ARE AT THE DOORS.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			WE'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
				(TAKES HER HAND)
			I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE SAFE, PADM�.

				PADM�
			THANK YOU, YOUR HIGHNESS. I ONLY
			WISH I COULD HAVE SERVED YOU
			BETTER BY STAYING ON CORUSCANT FOR
			THE VOTE.

				SIO BIBBLE
			GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, SENATOR,
			YOU KNOW IT WAS THE ONLY DECISION
			HER HIGHNESS COULD HAVE MADE.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			HOW MANY SYSTEMS HAVE JOINED COUNT
			DOOKU AND THE SEPARATISTS?

				PADM�
			ABOUT TWO HUNDRED. AND MORE ARE
			LEAVING THE REPUBLIC EVERY DAY.
			IF THE SENATE VOTES TO CREATE AN
			ARMY, I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO PUSH
			US INTO A CIVIL WAR.

				SIO BIBBLE
			IT'S UNTHINKABLE! THERE HASN'T
			BEEN A FULL-SCALE WAR SINCE THE
			FORMATION OF THE REPUBLIC!

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			DO YOU SEE ANY WAY, THROUGH
			NEGOTIATIONS, TO BRING THE
			SEPARATISTS BACK INTO THE REPUBLIC?

				PADM�
			NOT IF THEY FEEL THREATENED. THE
			SEPARATISTS DON'T HAVE AN ARMY,
			BUT IF THEY ARE PROVOKED, THEY
			WILL MOVE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.
			I'M SURE OF THAT. AND WITH NO TIME
			OR MONEY TO BUILD AN ARMY, MY
			GUESS IS THEY WILL TURN TO THE
			COMMERCE GUILDS OR THE TRADE
			FEDERATION FOR HELP.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			THE ARMIES OF COMMERCE! WHY HAS
			NOTHING BEEN DONE IN THE SENATE
			TO RESTRAIN THEM?

				PADM�
			I'M AFRAID THAT, DESPITE THE
			CHANCELLOR'S BEST EFFORTS, THERE
			ARE STILL MANY BUREAUCRATS,
			JUDGES, AND EVEN SENATORS ON THE
			PAYROLLS OF THE GUILDS.

				SIO BIBBLE
			IT'S OUTRAGEOUS! AFTER ALL OF
			THOSE HEARINGS, AND THE FOUR TRIALS IN
			THE SUPREME COURT, NUTE GUNRAY IS
			STILL THE VICEROY OF THE TRADE
			FEDERATION. DO THOSE MONEY
			MONGERS CONTROL EVERYTHING?

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			REMEMBER, COUNSELLOR, THE COURTS
			WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE
			FEDERATION'S ARMIES. THAT'S A
			MOVE IN THE RIGHT
			DIRECTION.

				PADM�
			THERE ARE RUMOURS, YOUR HIGHNESS,
			THAT THE FEDERATION ARMY WAS NOT
			REDUCED AS THEY WERE ORDERED.

				ANAKIN
			THE JEDI HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO
			INVESTIGATE. IT WOULD BE TO BE TOO
			DANGEROUS FOR THE ECONOMY, WE WERE
			TOLD.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			WE MUST KEEP OUR FAITH IN THE
			REPUBLIC. THE DAY WE STOP
			BELIEVING DEMOCRACY CAN WORK IS
			THE DAY WE LOSE IT.

				PADM�
			LET'S PRAY THAT DAY NEVER COMES.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			IN THE MEANTIME, WE MUST CONSIDER
			YOUR OWN SAFETY.

SIO BIBBLE SIGNALS. ALL THE OTHER ADVISORS AND ATTENDANTS BOW AND LEAVE THE ROOM.

				SIO BIBBLE
				(TO ANAKIN)
			WHAT IS YOUR SUGGESTION, MASTER
			JEDI?

				PADM�
			ANAKIN'S NOT A JEDI YET, COUNSELLOR.
			HE'S STILL A PADAWAN LEARNER. I
			WAS THINKING...

				ANAKIN
				(NETTLED)
			HEY, HOLD ON A MINUTE!

				PADM�
			EXCUSE ME! I WAS THINKING I WOULD
			STAY IN THE LAKE COUNTRY. THERE
			ARE SOME PLACES UP THERE THAT ARE
			VERY ISOLATED.

				ANAKIN
			EXCUSE ME?! I AM IN CHARGE OF
			SECURITY HERE, M'LADY.

SIO BIBBLE AND QUEEN JAMILLIA EXCHANGE A LOOK. SOMETHING IS GOING ON HERE.

				PADM�
			ANNIE, MY LIFE IS AT RISK, AND
			THIS IS MY HOME. I KNOW IT VERY
			WELL... THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE.
			I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE FOR YOU
			TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY KNOWLEDGE
			IN THIS INSTANCE.

				ANAKIN
				(TAKES A DEEP BREATH)
			SORRY, M'LADY.

				SIO BIBBLE
				(TO ANAKIN, AMUSED)
			SHE IS RIGHT. THE LAKE COUNTRY IS
			THE MOST REMOTE PART OF NABOO.
			NOT MANY PEOPLE AND A CLEAR VIEW
			OF THE SURROUNDING TERRAIN.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			PERFECT. IT'S SETTLED THEN.

ANAKIN GLARES AT PADME. THEN QUEEN JAMILLIA GETS UP, AND THEY ALL START TO LEAVE.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
				(CONTINUED)
			PADM�, I HAD AN AUDIENCE WITH YOUR
			FATHER YESTERDAY. I TOLD HIM WHAT
			WAS HAPPENING. HE HOPES YOU WILL
			VISIT YOUR MOTHER BEFORE YOU
			LEAVE... YOUR FAMILY'S VERY
			WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

PADME LOOKS WORRED. THEY ALL EXIT DOWN THE MAIN STAIRCASE.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
THE MAIN ENTRANCE AT THE BASE OF THE HUGE TEMPLE IS BUSTLING WITH ACTIVITY. ALL SORTS OF JEDI ARE COMING AND GOING.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY
A BRONZE BUST OF COUNT DOOKU, STANDS AMONG A LINE OF OTHER BUSTS OF JEDI IN THE ARCHIVE ROOM. OBI-WAN STANDS IN FRONT IT, STUDYING THE STRIKING FEATURES OF THE CHISELLED FACE.

ON THE WALLS, LIGHTED COMPUTER PANELS SEEM TO STRETCH INTO INFINITY. FARTHER ALONG THE ROOM IN THE BACKGROUND, FIVE JEDI ARE SEATED AT TABLES, STUDYING ARCHIVAL MATERIAL.

AFTER OBI-WAN STUDIES THE BUST FOR A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE MADAME JOCASTA NU, THE JEDI ARCHIVIST IS STANDING NEXT TO HIM. SHE IS AN ELDERLY, FRAIL-LOOKING HUMAN JEDI. TOUGH AS OLD BOOTS AND SMART AS A WHIP.

				JOCASTA NU
			DID YOU CALL FOR ASSISTANCE?

				OBI-WAN
				(DISTRACTED IN THOUGHT)
			YES... YES, I DID...

				JOCASTA NU
			HE HAS A POWERFUL FACE, DOESN'T
			HE? HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST
			BRILLIANT JEDI I HAVE HAD THE
			PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING.

				OBI-WAN
			I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY HE QUIT.
			ONLY TWENTY JEDI HAVE EVER LEFT
			THE ORDER.

				JOCASTA NU
				(SIGHS)
			THE LOST TWENTY... AND COUNT DOOKU
			WAS THE MOST RECENT AND THE MOST
			PAINFUL. NO ONE LIKES TO TALK
			ABOUT IT. HIS LEAVING WAS A GREAT
			LOSS TO THE ORDER.

				OBI-WAN
			WHAT HAPPENED?

				JOCASTA NU
			WELL, ONE MIGHT SAY, HE WAS ALWAYS
			A BIT OUT OF STEP WITH THE
			DECISIONS OF THE COUNCIL... MUCH
			LIKE YOUR OLD MASTER, QUI-GON JINN.

				OBI-WAN
				(SURPRISED)
			REALLY?

				JOCASTA NU
			OH, YES. THEY WERE ALIKE IN MANY
			WAYS. VERY INDIVIDUAL THINKERS...
			IDEALISTS...

JOCASTA NU STARES AT THE BUST

				JOCASTA NU
				(CONTINUING
			HE WAS ALWAYS STRIVING TO BECOME
			A MORE POWERFUL JEDI. HE WANTED
			TO BE THE BEST. WITH A LIGHTSABER,
			IN THE OLD STYLE OF FENCING, HE
			HAD NO MATCH. HIS KNOWLEDGE OF
			THE FORCE WAS... UNIQUE. IN THE
			END, I THINK HE LEFT BECAUSE HE
			LOST FAITH IN THE REPUBLIC. HE
			BELIEVED THAT POLITICS WERE
			CORRUPT, AND HE FELT THE JEDI
			BETRAYED THEMSELVES BY SERVING THE
			POLITICIANS. HE ALWAYS HAD VERY
			HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF GOVERNMENT.
			HE DISAPPEARED FOR NINE OR TEN
			YEARS, THEN HE JUST SHOWED UP
			RECENTLY AS THE HEAD OF THE
			SEPARATIST MOVEMENT.

				OBI-WAN
			INTERESTING... I'M STILL NOT SURE
			I UNDERSTAND.

				JOCASTA NU
			WELL, I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T CALL ME
			OVER HERE FOR A HISTORY LESSON.
			ARE YOU HAVING A PROBLEM, MASTER
			KENOBI?

				OBI-WAN
			YES, I'M TRYING TO FIND A PLANET
			SYSTEM CALLED KAMINO. IT DOESN'T
			SEEM TO SHOW UPON ANY OF THE
			ARCHIVE CHARTS.

				JOCASTA NU
			KAMINO? IT'S NOT A SYSTEM I'M
			FAMILIAR WITH... LET ME SEE...

JOCASTA NU LEANS OVER OBI-WAN'S SHOULDER, LOOKING AT THE SCREEN.

				JOCASTA NU
				(CONTINUING)
			ARE YOU SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
			CO-ORDINATES?

				OBI-WAN
				(NODDING)
			ACCORDING TO MY INFORMATION, IT
			SHOULD BE IN THIS QUADRANT
			SOMEWHERE... JUST SOUTH OF THE
			RISHI MAZE.

JOCASTA NU TAPS THE KEYBOARD AND FROWNS.

				JOCASTA NU
			NO CO-ORDINATES? IT SOUNDS LIKE THE
			KIND OF DIRECTIONS YOU'D GET FROM
			A STREET TOUT... SOME OLD MINER OR
			FURBOG TRADER.

				OBI-WAN
			ALL THREE ACTUALLY.

				JOCASTA NU
			ARE YOU SURE IT EXISTS?

				OBI-WAN
			ABSOLUTELY.

				JOCASTA NU
			LET ME DO A GRAVITATIONAL SCAN.

OBI-WAN AND JOCASTA NU STUDT THE STAR MAP HOLOGRAM.

				JOCASTA NU
			THERE ARE SOME INCONSISTENCIES
			HERE. MAYBE THE PLANET YOU'RE
			LOOKING FOR WAS DESTROYED.

				OBI-WAN
			WOULDN'T THAT BE ON RECORD?

				JOCASTA NU
			IT OUGHT TO BE. UNLESS IT WAS VERY
			RECENT.
				(SHAKES HER HEAD)
			I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT IT LOOKS
			LIKE THE SYSTEM YOU'RE SEARCHING
			FOR DOESN'T EXIST.

				OBI-WAN
			THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE... PERHAPS THE
			ARCHIVES ARE INCOMPLETE.

				JOCASTA NU
			THE ARCHIVES ARE COMPREHENSIVE AND
			TOTALLY SECURE, MY YOUNG JEDI.
			ONE THING YOU MAY BE ABSOLUTELY
			SURE OF - IF AN ITEM DOES NOT
			APPEAR IN OUR RECORDS, IT DOES NOT
			EXIST!

OBI-WAN STARES AT HER, THEN LOOKS BACK AT THE MAP.

EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON
PEOPLE ARE PASSING THROUGH THE LITTLE STREET, OLD MEN ARE SUNNING THEMSLVES, WOMEN ARE GOSSIPPING, KIDS ARE PLAYING. ANAKIN, PADME AND ARTOO TURN ONTO A SIDE STREET. ANAKIN IS BACK IN HIS JEDI ROBES. PADME WEAR A BEAUTIFUL SIMPLE DRESS. SHE STOPS, BEAMING.

				PADME
			THERE'S MY HOUSE!

PADME STARTS FORWARD; ANAKIN HANGS BACK.

				PADME
				(CONTINUING)
			WHAT? DON'T SAY YOU'RE SHY!

				ANAKIN
				(UNTRUTHFULLY)
			NO, BUT I...

SUDDENLY, THERE ARE SHOUTS FROM TWO LITTLE GIRILS, RYOO (AGE 6) AND POOJA (AGE 4). THEY COME RUNNING TOWARD PADME.

				RYOO & POOJA
			AUNT PADME!! AUNT PADME!!

				PADME
			RYOO!! POOJA!!

PADME SCOOPS UP RYOO AND POOJA AND HUGS THEM.

				PADME
				(CONTINUING)
			I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU! THIS IS
			ANAKIN. ANAKIN, THIS IS RYOO, AND
			THIS IS POOJA.

ANAKIN AND THE GIRLS SAY HELLO SHYLY. THEN:

				RYOO & POOJA
			ARTOO!!!

AS THEY SEE THE DROID, THEY HUG HIM. ARTOO WHISTLES AND BEEPS. PADME LAUGHS. ANAKIN AND PADME GO ON TOWARD THE HOUSE. THE GIRLS STAY AND PLAY WITH ARTOO.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
SOLA, PADME'S BEAUTIFUL OLDER SISTER, COMES IN FROM THE KITCHEN CARRYING A BIG BOWL OF FOOD.

				SOLA
				(OVER HER SHOULDER)
			THEY'RE EATING OVER AT JEV
			NARRAN'S LATER, MOM. THEY JUST
			HAD A SNACK. THEY'LL BE FINE.

SOLA PUTS THE BOWL DOWN ON THE TABLE, WHERE ANAKIN, PADME AND RUWEE NABERRIE (PADME'S FATHER) ARE COMING INTO THE ROOM.

				PADME
			ANAKIN, THIS IS MY SISTER, SOLA.

				SOLA
			HELLO, ANAKIN.

				ANAKIN
			HELLO.

SOLA SITS, AS JOBAL NABERRIE (PADME'S MOTHER) COMES IN WITH A HEAPED BOWL OF STEAMING FOOD.

				JOBAL
			YOU'RE JUST IN TIME FOR DINNER. I
			HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY, ANAKIN.

				ANAKIN
			A LITTLE.

				PADME
			HE'S BEING POLITE, MOM. WE'RE
			STARVING.

				RUWEE
				(GRINNING)
			YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE
			RIGHT TIME. SIT DOWN, SON.

EVERYONE SITS AND STARTS PASSING FOOD.

				JOBAL
				(TO PADME)
			HONEY, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU
			SAFE. WE WERE SO WORRIED.

PADME GIVES JOBAL A DIRTY LOOK. RUWEE SMILES AS HE WATCHES.

				RUWEE
			DEAR...

				JOBAL
			I KNOW, I KNOW... BUT I HAD TO SAY
			IT. NOW IT'S DONE.

				SOLA
			WELL, THIS IS EXCITING! DO YOU
			KNOW, ANAKIN, YOU'RE THE FIRST
			BOYFRIEND MY SISTER'S EVER BROUGHT
			HOME?

				PADME
				(ROLLS HER EYES)
			SOLA!! HE ISN'T MY BOYFRIEND!
			HE'S A JEDI ASSIGNED BY THE SENATE
			TO PROTECT ME.

				JOVAL
			A BODYGUARD?! OH, PADME! THEY
			DIDN'T TELL US IT WAS THAT SERIOUS!

				PADME
			IT'S NOT, MOM, I PROMISE.
				(GLANCES AT JOBAL)
			ANYWAY, ANAKIN'S A FRIEND. I'VE
			KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS. REMEMBER
			THAT LITTLE BOY WHO WAS WITH THE
			JEDI DURING THE BLOCKADE CRISIS?

THEY NOD.

				PADME
				(CONTINUING)
			HE GREW UP.

				JOBAL
			HONEY, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO
			SETTLE DOWN? HAVEN'T YOU HAD
			ENOUGH OF THAT LIFE? I CERTAINLY
			HAVE!

				PADME
			MOM, I'M NOT IN ANY DANGER.

				RUWEE
				(TO ANAKIN)
			IS SHE?

				ANAKIN
			...YES... I'M AFRAID SHE IS.

				PADME
				(QUICKLY)
			BUT NOT MUCH.

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN AND RUWEE ARE WALKING.

				RUWEE
			SOMETIMES I WISH I'D TRAVELED
			MORE... BUT I MUST SAY, I'M HAPPY
			HERE.

				ANAKIN
			PADME TELLS ME YOU TEACH AT THE
			UNIVERSITY?

				RUWEE
				(NODDING)
			YES, AND BEFORE THAT, I WAS A
			BUILDER. I ALSO WORKED FOR THE
			REFUGEE RELIEF MOVEMENT, WHEN I
			WAS VERY YOUNG.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME, SOLA AND JOBAL ARE CLEARING THE TABLE.

				SOLA
			WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD US ABOUT HIM?

				PADM�
			WHAT'S THERE TO TALK ABOUT?  HE'S
			JUST A BOY.

				SOLA
			A BOY? HAVE YOU SEEN THE WAY HE
			LOOKS AT YOU?

				PADM�
			SOLA - STOP IT!

				SOLA
			IT'S OBVIOUS HE HAS FEELINGS FOR
			YOU. ARE YOU SAYING, LITTLE BABY
			SISTER, THAT YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED?

				PADM�
			I'M NOT YOUR BABY SISTER, SOLA.
			ANAKIN AND I ARE FRIENDS... OUR
			RELATIONSHIP IS STRICTLY
			PROFESSIONAL.
				(TO JOBAL)
			MOM, WOULD YOU TELL HER TO STOP IT?

				SOLA
				(LAUGHING)
			WELL, MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED
			THE WAY HE LOOKS AT YOU. I THINK
			YOU'RE AFRAID TO.

				PADM�
			CUT IT OUT.

				JOBAL
			SOLA'S JUST CONCERNED... WE ALL
			ARE.

				PADM�
			OH, MOM, YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE. WHAT
			I'M DOING IS IMPORTANT.

				JOBAL
			YOU'VE DONE YOUR SERVICE, PADM�.
			IT'S TIME YOU HAD A LIFE OF YOUR
			OWN. YOU'RE MISSING SO MUCH!

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN AND RUWEE ARE WALKING IN THE GARDEN. RUWEE STOPS AND FACES ANAKIN DIRECTLY.

				RUWEE
			NOW TELL ME, SON. HOW SERIOUS IS
			THIS THING? HOW MUCH DANGER IS MY
			DAUGHTER REALLY IN?

				ANAKIN
			THERE HAVE BEEN TWO ATTEMPTS ON
			HER LIFE. CHANCES ARE THERE'LL BE
			MORE. MY MASTER IS TRACKING DOWN
			THE ASSASSINS. I'M SURE HE'LL FIND
			OUT WHO THEY ARE. THIS SITUATION,
			WON'T LAST LONG.

				RUWEE
			I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO
			HER.

				ANAKIN
			I DON'T EITHER.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, PADME'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME THROWS SOME THINGS INTO A BAG.

				PADME
			DON'T WORRY, THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

				ANAKIN
			I JUST WANT TO GET THERE BEFORE
			DARK.

PADME GOES ON PACKING. ANAKIN LOOKS AROUND THE ROOM.

				ANAKIN
				(CONTINUING)
			YOU STILL LIVE AT HOME.

				PADME
			I MOVE AROUND SO MUCH, I'VE NEVER
			HAD A PLACE OF MY OWN. OFFICIAL
			RESIDENCES HAVE NO WARMTH. I FEEL
			GOOD HERE. I FEEL AT HOME.

				ANAKIN
			I NEVER HAD A REAL HOME. HOME WAS
			ALWAYS WHERE MY MOM WAS.

ANAKIN PICKS UP A FRAMED HOLOGRAM.

				ANAKIN
				(CONTINUING)
			IS THIS YOU?

THE HOLOGRAM SHOWS PADME AT AGE SEVEN OR EIGHT SURROUNDED BY FORTY OR FIFTY LITTLE GREEN CREATURES. SHE IS HOLDING ONE IN HER ARMS. THEY ARE ALL SMILING HUGELY.

				PADME
			THAT WAS WHEN I WENT WITH THE
			RELIEF GROUP TO SHADDA-BI-BORAN.
			THEIR SUN WAS IMPLODING, AND THE
			PLANET WAS DYING. I WAS HELPING
			TO RELOCATE THE CHILDREN. SEE
			THAT LITTLE ONE I'M HOLDING? HIS
			NAME WAS N'A-KEE-TULA, WHICH MEANS
			SWEETHEAR. HE WAS SO FULL OF
			LIFE,. ALL THOSE KIDS WERE. I DID
			EVERYTHING I COULD TO SAVE HIM,
			BUT HE DIED... THEY ALL DID. THEY
			WERE NEVER ABLE TO ADAPT... TO
			LIVE OFF THEIR NATIVE PLANET.

ANAKIN PICKS UP ANOTHER HOLOGRAM. IT SHOWS PADME AT AGE TEN OR ELEVEN. SHE IS WEARING OFFICIAL ROBES AND STANDING BETWEEN TWO ROBED LEGISLATORS. HER EXPRESSION IS SEVERE.

				PADME
				(CONTINUING)
			MY FIRST DAY AS AN APPRENTICE
			LEGISLATOR. NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE?

PADME PULLS A FACE. ANAKIN GRINS. SHE CONTINUES PACKING. ANAKIN SETS THE TWO HOLOGRAMS DOWN SIDE BY SIDE - THE BEAMING LITTLE GIRL, AND THE THE STERN, UNSMILING ADOLESCENT.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
OBI-WAN WALKS THROUGH THE MAIN HALLWAY TO THE TRAINING AREA.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY
OBI-WAN COMES OUT ONTO THE VERANDA AND STOPS, WATCHING TWENTY OR SO FOUR-YEAR-OLDS DOING TRAINING EXERCISES, SUPERVISED BY YODA. THEY WEAR HELMETS OVER THEIR EYES AND TRY TO STRIKE LITTLE TRAINING DROIDS WITH THEIR MINIATURE LIGHTSABERS. THE DROIDS DANCE IN FRONT OF THEM.

				YODA
			DON'T THINK... FEEL... BE AS ONE
			WITH THE FORCE. HELP YOU, IT WILL.
				(HE SEES OBI-WAN)
			YOUNGLINGS - ENOUGH! A VISITOR WE
			HAVE. WELCOME HIM.

THE CHILDREN TAKE OFF THEIR HELMETS AND TURN OFF THEIR LIGHTSABERS.

				YODA
				(CONTINUING)
			MASTER OBI-WAN KENOBI, MEET THE
			MIGHTY BEAR CLAN.

				CHILDREN
			WELCOME, MASTER OBI-WAN!

				OBI-WAN
			I AM SORRY TO DISTURB YOU, MASTER.

				YODA
			WHAT HELP TO YOU, CAN I BE?

				OBI-WAN
			I�M LOOKING FOR A PLANET DESCRIBED
			TO ME BY AN OLD FRIEND. I TRUST
			HIM. BUT THE SYSTEM DOESN�T SHOW
			UP ON THE ARCHIVE MAPS.

				YODA
			AN INTERESTING PUZZLE. GATHER
			ROUND THE MAP READER, YOUNGLINGS.
			MASTER OBI-WAN HAS LOST A PLANET.
			FIND IT, WE WILL TRY...

THE MAP READER IS A SMALL SHAFT WITH A HOLLOW OPENING AT THE TOP. THE CCHILDREN GATHER AROUND IT. OBI-WAN TAKES OUT A LITTLE GLASS BALL AND PLACES IT INTO THE BOWL. THE WINDOW SHADES CLOSE DARKENING THE ROOM AND THE READER LIGHTS UP, PROJECTING THE STAR MAP HOLOGRAM INTO THE ROOM. THE CHILDREN LAUGH. SOME OF THEM REACH UP TO TRY AND TOUCH THE NEBULAE AND STARS. OBI-WAN WALKS INTO THE DISPLAY.

				OBI-WAN
			THIS IS WHERE IT OUGHT TO BE...
			BUT IT ISN�T. GRAVITY IS PULLING
			ALL THE STARS IN THIS AREA INWARD
			TO THIS SPOT. THERE SHOULD BE A
			STAR HERE... BUT THERE ISN�T.

				YODA
			MOST INTERESTING. GRAVITY�S
			SILHOUETTE REMAINS, BUT THE STAR
			AND ALL ITS PLANETS HAVE
			DISAPPEARED. HOW CAN THIS BE?

THERE IS A BRIEF PAUSE. THEN A CHILD PUTS ITS HAND UP. YODA NODS.

				JEDI CHILD JACK
			BECAUSE SOMEONE ERASED IT FROM THE
			ARCHIVE MEMORY.

				CHILDREN
			THAT�S RIGHT! YES! THAT�S WHAT
			HAPPENED! SOMEONE ERASED IT!

				JEDI CHILD MAY
			IF THE PLANET BLEW UP, THE GRAVITY
			WOULD GO AWAY.

OBI-WAN STARES; YODA CHUCKLES.

				YODA
			TRULY WONDERFUL, THE MIND OF A
			CHILD IS. UNCLUTTERED. TO THE
			CENTRE OF THE PULL OF GRAVITY GO,
			AND FIND YOUR PLANET YOU WILL.

				OBI-WAN
			BUT MASTER YODA WHO COULD HAVE
			ERASED INFORMATION FROM THE
			ARCHIVES? THAT�S IMPOSSIBLE,
			ISN�T IT?

				YODA
				(FROWNING)
			MUCH HARDER TO ANSWER, THAT
			QUESTION IS.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
A WATER SPEEDER DRIVEN BY PADDY ACCU, THE RETREAT CARETAKER, SKIMS ACROSS THE LAKE AWAY FROM THE ISLAND LANDING PLATFORM WHERE A CHROME NABOO STARSHIP RESTS. ANAKIN AND PADME ARE SITTING IN THE SPEEDER AS IT SKIMS AWAY TO WHERE A LODGE RISES ON A BEAUTIFUL ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN AND PADME WALK UP THE STAIRS FROM WHERE THE WATER SPEEDER IS PARKED ONTO A TERRACE OVERLOOKING A LOVELY GARDEN. BEHIND THEM, PADDY ACCU SUPERVISES TWO SERVING GIRLS, NANDI AND TECKLA, AS THEY CARRY THE BAGS INTO THE LODGE.

ANAKIN AND PADME STOP AT THE BALUSTRADE. PADME LOOKS OUT ACROSS THE GARDEN TO THE SHIMMERING LAKE AND THE MOUNTAINS RISING BEYOND. ANAKIN LOOKS AT HER SILENTLY.

				PADM�
			WHEN I WAS IN LEVEL THREE, WE USED
			TO COME HERE FOR SCHOOL RETREAT.
			SEE THAT ISLAND? WE USED TO SWIM
			THERE EVERY DAY. I LOVE THE WATER.

				ANAKIN
			I DO TOO. I GUESS IT COMES FROM
			GROWING UP ON A DESERT PLANET.

PADME BECOMES AWARE THAT ANAKIN IS LOOKING AT HER.

				PADM�
			...WE USED TO LIE ON THE SAND AND
			LET THE SUN DRY US... AND TRY TO
			GUESS THE NAMES OF THE BIRDS
			SINGING.

				ANAKIN
			I DON�T LIKE SAND. IT�S COARSE
			AND ROUGH AND IRRITATING, AND IT
			GETS EVERYWHERE. NOT LIKE HERE.
			HERE EVERYTHING�S SOFT... AND
			SMOOTH...

HE TOUCHES HER ARM. PADME HAS BECOME RECEPTIVE TO THE WAY HE LOOKS AT HER BUT IS NERVOUS.

				PADM�
			THERE WAS A VERY OLD MAN WHO LIVED
			ON THE ISLAND. HE USED TO MAKE
			GLASS OUT OF SAND - AND VASES AND
			NECKLACES OUT OF THE GLASS. THEY
			WERE MAGICAL.

				ANAKIN
				(LOOKS INTO HER EYES)
			EVERYTHING HERE IS MAGICAL.

				PADM�
			YOU COULD LOOK INTO THE GLASS AND
			SEE THE WATER. THE WAY IT RIPPLES
			AND MOVES. IT LOOKED SO REAL...
			BUT IT WASN�T.

				ANAKIN
			SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU BELIEVE
			SOMETHING TO BE REAL, IT BECOMES
			REAL. REAL ENOUGH, ANYWAY...

THEY LOOK INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES. HE TOUCHES HER CHIN.

				PADM�
			I USED TO THINK IF YOU LOOKED TOO
			DEEPLY INTO GLASS, YOU WOULD
			LOSE YOURSELF.

				ANAKIN
			I THINK IT'S TRUE...

ANAKIN KISSES PADME. SHE DOESN'T RESIST. SHE COMES TO HER SENSES AND PULLS AWAY.

				PADM�
			I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

				ANAKIN
			I'M SORRY. WHEN I'M AROUND YOU,
			MY MIND IS NO LONGER MY OWN.

				PADM�
			IT'S THE SITUATION... THE STRESS...

HE LOOKS AT HER.

				ANAKIN
			...THE VIEW.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER IS READY FOR TAKEOFF. OBI-WAN AND MACE WINDU STAND BESIDE IT.

				MACE WINDU
			BE WARY, THIS DISTURBANCE IN THE
			FORCE IS GROWING STRONGER.

				OBI-WAN
			I AM CONCERNED FOR MY PADAWAN. HE
			IS NOT READY TO BE ON HIS OWN.

				YODA
			THE COUNCIL IS CONFIDENT IN THIS DECISION,
			OBI-WAN.

				MACE
			HE HAS EXCEPTIONAL SKILLS. THE
			COUNCIL IS CONFIDENT IN ITS
			DECISION, OBI-WAN. IF THE
			PROPHECY IS TRUE, HE WEILL BE THE
			ONE TO BRING BALANCE TO THE FORCE.

				OBI-WAN
			BUT HE STILL HAS MUCH TO LEARN.
			AND HIS ABILITIES HAVE MADE HIM...
			WELL... ARROGANT. I REALISE NOW
			WHAT YOU AND MASTER YODA KNEW FROM
			THE BEGINNING... THE BOY WAS TOO
			OLD TO START THE TRAINING AND...

OBI-WAN HESITATES.

				MACE WINDU
			THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE?

				OBI-WAN
			MASTER, HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
			GIVEN THIS ASSIGNMENT. I'M AFRAID
			ANAKIN WON'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT
			THE SENATOR.

				MACE WINDU
			WHY?

				OBI-WAN
			HE HAS A... AN EMOTIONAL
			CONNECTION WITH HER. IT'S BEEN
			THERE SINCE HE WAS BOY. NOW
			HE'S CONFUSED... DISTRACTED.

				MACE-WINDU
			OBI-WAN, YOU MUST HAVE FAITH THAT
			HE WILL TAKE THE RIGHT PATH.

OBI-WAN CLIMBS INTO THE COCKPIT OF THE STARFIGHTER.

				OBI-WAN
			HAS MASTER YODA GAINED ANY INSIGHT
			INTO WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAR WILL
			COME ABOUT?

				MACE WINDU
			PROBING THE DARK SIDE IS A
			DANGEROUS PROCESS. HE COULD BE IN
			SECLUSION FOR DAYS... MAY THE
			FORCE BE WITH YOU.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON
YODA SITS WITH HIS EYES CLOSED, MEDITATING. SILENCE.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON
THE SETTING SUN TOUCHES THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS. THE LAKE GLOWS IN THE ROSE-TINTED LIGHT. FLOATINF LAMPS GLEAN SOFTLY LIKE JEWELS AT THE LODGE.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
NANDI PLACE DESSERT IN FRONT OF PADME. TECKLA DOES THE SAME FOR ANAKIN. THE DESSERT IS SOME KIND OF FRUIT. PADME PICKS UP HER FORK AND GOES TO SPEAR A PIECE, BUT IT MOVES! SHE FROWNS AND TRIES AGAIN -THE FRUIT MOVES. SHE LOKK UP AT ANAKIN. HIS EYES ARE ON HIS PLATE.

				PADME
			YOU DID THAT?

ANAKIN LOOKS UP - WIDE-EYED INNOCENCE.

				ANAKIN
			WHAT?

PADME SCOWLS AT HIM. PADME JABS AT THE FRUIT - ANAKIN SUBTLY MOVES HIS HAND AND IT LIFTS UP FROM THE PLATE AND HOVERS IN FRONT OF HER.

				PADME
			THAT! NOW STOP IT!

PADME LAUGHS. ANAKIN LAUGHS. SHE REACHES OUT FOR THE FRUIT - IT LOOPS.

				PADME
				(CONTINUING)
			ANAKIN!!

ANAKIN MOVES HIS FINGERS. THE FRUIT FLIES INTO HIS HAND.

				ANAKIN
			I'M NOT REALLY SUPPOSED TO DO
			THAT... FOR FUN, I MEAN. IF
			MASTER OBI-WAN WERE HERE, HE'D BE
			VERY GRUMPY.

ANAKIN IS PLEASED. HE CUTS THE FRUINT INTO SEVERAL PIECES AND SENDS ONE BACK TO PADME. SHE BITES IT OUT OF THE AIR AND LAUGHS.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT
A FIRE BLAZES IN THE OPEN HEARTH. PADME IS SITTING IN FRONT OF IT, GAZING AT THE FLAMES.

SHE LOOKS UP AS ANAKIN ARRIVES. SHE MAKES ROOM FOR HIM. BRIEF PAUSE.

				ANAKIN
			MAY I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

				PADME
			I DON'T KNOW.

				ANAKIN
			THEN HOW CAN I TELL YOU?

				PADME
			MAYBE YOU SHOULD USE YOUR JEDI
			INTUITION.

				ANAKIN
			IT DOESN'T WORK AROUND YOU. MY
			MIND IS ALWAYS A MUDDLE... I CAN
			ONLY THINK OF YOU.

				PADME
			ANAKIN, DON'T...

				ANAKIN
			FROM THE MOMENT I MET YOU, ALL
			THOSE YEARS AGO, A DAY HASN'T GONE
			BY WHEN I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YOU.
			AND NOW THAT I'M CLOSE TO YOU AGAIN,
			I'M IN AGONY. THE CLOSER I GET TO
			YOU, THE WORSE IT GETS. THE
			THOUGHT OF NOT BEING WITH YOU
			MSKES MY STOMACH TURN OVER - MY
			MOUTH GOES DRY. I FEEL DIZZY. I
			CAN'T BREATHE. I'M HAUNTED BY THE
			KISS YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN
			ME. MY HEART IS BEATING, HOPING
			THAT KISS WILL NOT BECOME A SCAR.
			YOU ARE IN MY VERY SOUL,
			TORMENTING ME. WHAT CAN I DO? I
			WILL DO ANYTHING YOU ASK...

SILENCE. THE LOGS FLAME IN THE HEARTH.

				ANAKIN
				(CONTINUING)
			IF YOU ARE SUFFERING AS MUCH AS I
			AM, TELL ME.

				PADME
			...I CAN'T. WE CAN'T. IT'S JUST
			NOT POSSIBLE.

				ANAKIN
			ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. PADME,
			PLEASE LISTEN...

				PADME
			YOU LISTEN. WE LIVE IN A REAL
			WORLD. COME BACK TO IT. YOU'RE
			STUDYING TO BECOME A JEDI KNIGHT.
			I'M A SENATOR. IF YOU FOLLOW YOUR
			THOUGHTS THROUGH TO CONCLUSION,
			THEY WILL TAKE US TO A PLACE WE
			CANNOT GO... REGARDLESS OF THE WAY
			WE FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER.

				ANAKIN
			THEN YOU DO FEEL SOMETHING!
			THERE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
			CONNECTION BETWEEN US. YOU CAN'T
			DENY THAT.

				PADME
			ANNIE, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY
			DIFFERENCE. JEDI AREN'T ALLOWED
			TO MARRY. YOU SWORE AN OATH,
			REMEMBER? YOU'D BE EXPELLED FROM
			THE ORDER. I WILL NOT LET YOU
			GIVE UP YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES...
			YOUR FUTURE, FOR ME.

				ANAKIN
			I WAS DESTINED TO BE A JEDI. I
			DON'T THINK I COULD BE ANYTHING
			ELSE. BUT YOU ARE ASKING ME TO BE
			RATIONAL. THAT IS SOMETHING I
			KNOW I CANNOT DO. I WISH I COULD
			WISH MY FEELINGS AWAY... BUT I
			CAN'T.

				PADME
			I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE INTO THIS.
			I'M NOT GOING TO THROW MY LIFE
			AWAY. I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
			TO DO THAN FALL IN LOVE.

THERE IS SILENCE AS THEY STARE AT THE FIRE. ANAKIN IS THINKING.

				ANAKIN
			IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY...
			WE COULD KEEP IT A SECRET.

				PADME
			THEN WE'D BE LIVING A LIE - ONE WE
			COULDN'T KEEP EVEN IF WE WANTED
			TO. MT SISTER SAW IT. SO DID MY
			MOTHER. I COULDN'T DO THAT.
			COULD YOU, ANAKIN? COULD YOU LIVE
			LIKE THAT?

SILENCE FOR A MOMENT.

				ANAKIN
			...NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT WOULD
			DESTROY US.

EXT. SPACE
IT'S JUST LIKE THE STAR MAP HOLOGRAM, PLUS THE STORM-SHROUDED PLANET OF KAMINO, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE IT OUGHT TO BE. OBI-WAN'S STARSHIP FLIES OVER CAMERA AND HEADS DOWN TOWARD THE PLANET.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
HEAVY RANS AND HARD-DRIVING WINDS LASH THE PLATFORM AS OBI-WAN'S STARSHIP APPROACHES. THE HUGE, ULTRA-MODERN CITY OF TIPOCA RESTS ON GREAT STILTS THAT KEEP IT ABOVE THE POUNDING AND EVER-PRESENT WAVES THAT COVER THE SURFACE OF THIS WATERY WORLD.

THE STARFIGHTER LANDS. OBI-WAN GETS OUT AND MAKES HIS WAY THROUGH THE BOWLING WIND TOWARD A TOWER ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE PLATFORM. A DOOR SLIDES OPEN. A SHAFT OF BRILLIANT LIGHT PIERCES THE SWIRLING RAIN. OBI-WAN PASSES THROUGH IT AND GOES INSIDE.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE
A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT. OBI-WAN PUSHES THE SOAKING HOOD FROM HIS FACE.

				TAUN WE
			WELCOME TO TIPOCA CITY, MASTER
			JEDI.

OBI-WAN WIPES THE RAIN FROM HIS FACE AND BLINKS IN SURPRISE AT A TALL, PASTY-WHITE ALIEN NAMED TAUN WE. HE HAS LARGE, ALMOND SHAPED EYES.

				TAUN WE
			EVERYTHING IS READY. THE PRIME
			MINISTER EXPECTS YOU.

				OBI-WAN
				(WARILY)
			I'M EXPECTED?

				TAUN WE
			OF COURSE! HE IS ANXIOUS TO SEE
			YOU. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, WE
			WERE BEGINNING TO THINK YOU
			WEREN'T COMING. NOW PLEASE, THIS
			WAY!

OBI-WAN MASKS HIS SURPRISE AS THEY MOVE AWAY ALONG THE CORRIDOR.

OBI-WAN FOLLOWS TAUN WE CAUTIOUSLY.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY
THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN. OBI-WAN AND TAUN WE ENTER AND CROSS TO WHERE LAMA SU RISES, SMILING, FROM BEHIND HIS DESK, WHICH, LIKE ALL THE FURNITURE ON KAMINO, SEEMS MADE OUT OF PURE LIGHT.

				TAUN WE
			MAY I PRESENT LAMA SU, PRIME
			MINISTER OF KAMINO... AND THIS IS
			MASTER JEDI...

				OBI-WAN
			OBI-WAN KENOBI.

				LAMA SU
			PLEASE...

LAMA SU INDICATES A CHAIR. OBI-WAN SITS. TAUN WE HOVERS. THE ROOM IS BATHED IN BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT. THE WHOLE PLACE IS ULTRA HIGH-TECH.

				LAMA SU
			I TRUST YOU ARE GOING TO ENJOY
			YOUR STAY. WE ARE MOST HAPPY YOU
			HAVE ARRIVED AT THE BEST PART OF
			THE SEASON.

				OBI-WAN
			YOU MAKE ME FEEL MOST WELCOME.

				LAMA SU
			AND NOW TO BUSINESS. YOU WILL BE
			DELIGHTED TO HEAR WE ARE ON
			SCHEDULE. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
			UNITS ARE READY, WITH ANOTHER
			MILLION WELL ON THE WAY.

				OBI-WAN
				(IMPROVISING)
			THAT IS... GOOD NEWS.

				LAMA SU
			PLEASE TELL YOUR MASTER SIDO-DYAS
			THAT WE HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE HIS
			ORDER WILL BE MET ON TIME AND IN
			FULL. HE IS WELL, I HOPE?

				OBI-WAN
			I'M SORRY MASTER - ?

				LAMA SU
			JEDI MASTER SIFO-DYAS. HE'S STILL
			A LEADING MEMBER OF THE JEDI
			COUNCIL, IS HE NOT?

				OBI-WAN
			OH, YES. SIDO-DYAS.

				LAMA SU
				(RISING)
			YOU MUST BE ANXIOUS TO INSPECT THE
			UNITS FOR YOURSELF.

				OBI-WAN
			THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON
PADME AND ANAKIN ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN IDYLLIC HILLY MEADOW, ITS LUSH GRASSES SPRINKLED WITH FLOWERS. AT A DISTANCE, A HERD OF SHAAKS GRAZE CONTENTEDLY.

BEYOND IS THE SHIMMERING EXPANSE OF THE LAKE. SEVERAL OTHER LAKES STRETCH TO THE HORIZON. THE WARM AIR IS FULL OF LITTLE FLOATING PUFFBALLS. THEY SIT ON THE GRASS, IN A PLAYFUL, COY MOOD, TALKING. PADME IS PICKING FLOWERS.

				PADM�
			I DON'T KNOW...

				ANAKIN
			SURE YOU DO... YOU JUST DON'T WANT
			TO TELL ME.

				PADM�
			ARE YOU GOING TO USE ONE OF YOUR
			JEDI MIND TRICKS ON ME?

				ANAKIN
			THEY ONLY WORK ON THE WEAK-MINDED.
			YOU ARE ANYTHING BUT WEAK-MINDED.

				PADM�
			ALL RIGHT... HIS NAME WAS PALO.
			I WAS TWELVE. WE WERE BOTH IN THE
			LEGISLATIVE YOUTH PROGRAM. HE WAS
			A FEW YEARS OLDER THEN I... VERY
			CUTE... DARK CURLY HAIR... DREAMY
			EYES.

				ANAKIN
			ALL RIGHT, I GET THE PICTURE...
			WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM?

				PADM�
			I WENT ON TO BECOME A QUEEN. HE
			WENT ON TO BECOME AN ARTIST.

				ANAKIN
			MAYBE HE WAS THE SMART ONE.

				PADME
			YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE POLITICIANS,
			DO YOU?

				ANAKIN
			I LIKE TWO OR THREE, BUT I'M NOT
			REALLY SURE ABOUT ONE OF THEM.
				(SMILING)
			I DON'T THINK THE SYSTEM WORKS.

				PADME
			HOW WOULD YOU HAVE IT WORK?

				ANAKIN
			WE NEED A SYSTEM WHERE THE
			POLITICIANS SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS
			THE PROBLEMS, AGREE WHAT'S IN THE
			BEST INTERESTS OF ALL THE PEOPLE,
			AND THEN DO IT.

				PADME
			THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DO. THE
			TROUBLE IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T
			WLWAYS AGREE. IN FACT, THEY
			HARDLY EVER DO.

				ANAKIN
			THEN THEY SHOULD BE MADE TO.

				PADME
			BY WHOM? WHO'S GOING TO MAKE THEM?

				ANAKIN
			I DON'T KNOW. SOMEONE.

				PADME
			YOU?

				ANAKIN
			OF COURSE NOT ME.

				PADME
			BUT SOMEONE.

				ANAKIN
			SOMEONE WISE.

				PADME
			THAT SOUNDS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE A
			DICTATORSHIP TO ME.

A MISCHIEVIOUS LITTLE GRIN CREEPS ACROSS HIS FACE.

				ANAKIN
			WELL, IF IT WORKS...

PADME STARES AT ANAKIN. HE LOOKS BACK AT HER, STRAIGHT-FACED, AND CAN'T HOLD A SMILE.

				PADM�
			YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME.

				ANAKIN
			 	(SARCASTIC)
			ON NO, I'D BE MUCH TOO FRIGHTENED
			TO TEASE A SENATOR.

				PADM�
			YOU'RE SO BAD!

PADME PICKS UP A PIECE OF FRUIT AND THROWS IT AT HIM. HE CATCHES IT. PADME THROWS TWO MORE PIECES OF FRUIT, AND ANAKIN CATCHES THEM.

				ANAKIN
			YOU'RE ALWAYS SO SERIOUS. ALWAYS
			CARRYING THE WEIGHT OF THE
			UNIVERSE ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

ANAKIN THEN STARTS TO JUGGLE THE FRUIT. PADME LAUGHS AND THROWS MORE FRUIT AT HIM. HE MANAGES TO JUGGLE THEM TOO UNTIL THERE ARE TOO MANY, AND HE LOSES CONTROL AND DUCKS, LETTING FOOD FALL ON HIS HEAD. THEY BOTH LAUGH.

ANAKIN STANDS IN FRONT OF A SHAAK, YELLING AT IT AND WAVING HIS ARMS. PADME STARTS LAUGHING AS ANAKIN RUNS IN CIRCLES, CHASED BY THE SHAAK.

THE SHAAK CROSSES IN FRONT OF PADME. ANAKIN IS RIDING IT, FACING THE SHAAK'S TAIL. THE SHAAK BUCKS, AND ANAKIN FALLS OFF. PADME LAUGHS EVEN HARDER. ANAKIN LIES STILL. PADME JUMPS UIP AND RUNS TO WHERE ANAKIN IS FACE DOWN IN THE GRASS. SHE TURNS HIM OVER. HE IS PULLING A STUPID FACE AT HER. SHE YELPS IN MOCK FURY AND TAKES A SWING AT HIM. HE CATCHES HER ARM. SHE STRUGGLES. THEY ROLL OVER IN THE GRASS. SUDDENLY, THEY BECOME AWARE OF THE CONTACT BETWEEN THEM. THEY LET GO OF EACH OTHER QUICKLY AND SIT UP, LOOKING AWAY.

ANAKIN STANDS UP AND HOLDS OUT HIS HAND TO HER. SHE TAKE IT. HE PULLS HER UP. AND NOW THEY ARE EASY TOGETHER, NOT SELF-CONSCIOUS ANY MORE. PADME SCRAMBLES UP ONTO THE SHAAK BEHIND ANAKIN. SHE PUTS HER ARMS AROUND HIS WAIST AND LEANS AGAINST HIS BACK. ABAJUB DIGS HIS HEELS IN. THE SHAAK STARTS FORWARD, AND THEY RIDE AWAY.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN, LAMA SU AND TAUN WE COME OUT ONTO A BALCONY. BELOW IS A HUGE PARADE GROUND. THE RAIN AND WIND ARE BRUTAL. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, FACES COVERED BY HELMETS, ARE MARCHING AND DRILLING IN FORMATIONS OF SEVERAL HUNDRED.

				LAMA SU
				(BEAMING)
			MAGNIFICENT, AREN'T THEY?

OBI-WAN NODS SLOWLY.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY
LAMA SU CONDUCTS OBI-WAN THROUGH A LARGE EATING AREA. TAUN WE FOLLOWS AS THEY WALK BY HUNDREDS OF CLONES WHO LOOK EXACTLY ALIKE, ALL ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OLD, DRESSED IN BLACK. THEY ARE SEATED AT TABLES, EATING.

				LAMA SU
			WE MODIFIED THEIR GENETIC
			STRUCTURE TO MAKE THEM LESS
			INDEPENDENT THAN THE ORIGINAL
			HOST. AS A RESULT THEY ARE
			TOTALLY OBEDIENT, TAKING ANY ORDER
			WITHOUT QUESTION.

				OBI-WAM
			WHO WAS THE ORIGINAL HOST?

				LAMA SU
			A BOUNTY HUNTER CALLED JANGO FETT.
			WE FELT A JEDI WOULD BE THE
			PERFECT CHOICE, BUT SIDO-DYAS HAND-
			PICKED JANGO FETT HIMSELF.

				OBI-WAN
			WHERE IS THIS BOUNTY HUNTER NOW?

				LAMA SU
			OH, WE KEEP HIM HERE. AFTER A FEW
			HUNDRED THOUSAND CLONES, THE
			GENETIC PATTERN STARTS TO FADE, SO
			WE TAKE A FRESH SUPPLY. HE LIVES
			HERE, BUT HE'S FREE TO COME AND GO
			AS HE PLEASES.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY
THE TOUR CONTINUES THROUGH A LONG CORRIDOR FOLLED WITH NARROW, TRANSPARENT TUBES INTO WHICH CLONES ARE CLIMBING. ONCE IN THE TUBE, THE CLONE GOES TO SLEEP.

				LAMA SU
			APART FROM HIS PAY, WHICH IS
			CONSIDERABLE, FETT DEMANDED ONLY
			ONE THING - AN UNALTERED CLONE FOR
			HIMSELF. CURIOUS ISN'T IT?

				OBI-WAN
			UNALTERED?

				LAMA SU
			PURE GENETIC REPLICATION. NO
			TAMPERING WITH THE STRUCTURE TO
			MAKE IT MORE DOCILE... AND NO
			GROWTH ACCELERATION...

				OBI-WAN
			I WOULD LIKE TO MEET THIS JANGO
			FETT.

				TAUN WE
			I WOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO ARRANGE
			IT, FOR YOU.

TAUN WE BOWS, AND LEAVES.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY
THE TOUR CONTINUES THROUGH A CLASSROOM FILLED WITH IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES.

				OBI-WAN
			YOU MENTIONED GROWTH
			ACCELERATION...

				LAMA SU
			OH YES, IT'S ESSENTIAL.
			OTHERWISE, A MATURE CLONE WOULD
			TAKE A LIFETIME TO GROW. NOW, WE
			CAN DO IT IN HALF THE TIME. THOSE
			ITEMS YOU SAW ON THE PARADE GROUND
			WERE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO, WHEN
			SIDO-DYAS FIRST PLACED THE ORDER,
			AND THEY'RE ALREADY MATURE...

OBI-WAN LOOKS AT THE BOY CLONES.

				OBI-WAN
			AND THESE?

				LAMA SU
			ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY
THEY ENTER A SPACE FILLED WITH GREAT RACKS OF GLASS SPHERES, WHICH ARE FILLED WITH FLUID IN WHICH EMBRYOS ARE SUSPENDED.

				LAMA SU
			THEY'RE IMMENSELY SUPERIOR TO
			DROIDS, CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT
			THOUGHT AND ACTION.

				OBI-WAN
			VERY IMPRESSIVE.

				LAMA SU
			I'D HOPED YOU WOULD BE PLEASED.

OBI-WAN GAZES AT THE NEAREST EMBRYOS.

				OBI-WAN
				(CAREFULLY)
			TELL ME, PRIME MINISTER, WHEN MY
			MASTER SIDO-DYAS FIRST CONTACTED
			YOU, DID HE SAY THE ORDER WAS
			FOR... HIMSELF... OR?

				LAMA SU
			HIMSELF? OF COURSE NOT. THIS
			ARMY IS FOR THE REPUBLIC?

				OBI-WAN
				(ASTONISHED)
			THE REPUBIC?

				LAMA SU
			WE ARE ALSO VERY MUCH AGASINT THIS
			COUNT DOOKU AND HIS SECCESSIONIST
			MOVEMENT. WE ARE PROUD TO BE OF
			HELP TO THE REPUBLIC.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
TAUN WE SHOWS OBI-WAN INTO HIS ROOM.

				TAUN WE
			I HAVE ARRANGED FOR YOU TO MEET
			JANGO FETT IN THE MORNING. SLEEP
			WELL.

TAUN WE GOES. THE DOOR SLIDES CLOSED BEHIND HIM. OBI-WAN LOOKS AROUND, THEN MOVES SWIFTLY TO CHECK THE ROOM OVER. FINALLY, SATISFIED, HE TAKES OUT HIS COMLINK.

				OBI-WAN
			ARFOUR, ARFOUR...

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
THE R4 D17, OBI-WAN'S ASTRO-DROID, WHO IS SITTING ON TOP OF OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER, SWITCHES ON AND BEEPS.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN HEARS ARFOUR BEEP THROUGH HIS COMLINK.

				OBI-WAN
			ARFOUR, RELAY THIS, "SCRAMBLE CODE
			FIVE," TO COURSCANT: CARE OF "THE
			OLD FOLKS HOME."

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
ARFOUR BEEPS AND WHISTLES. THE PANELS LIGHT UP INSIDE THE COCKPIT, AS THE MESSAGE IS TRANSMITTED.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVINF QUARTERS - EARLY EVENING
YODA AND MACE WINDU LISTEN AS A HOLOGRAM OF OBI-WAN STANDS BETWEEN THEM BROADCASTING THE MASSAGE. THE SINGNAL IS VERY WEAK, THE IMAGE FADES IN AND OUT.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			...I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A JEDI
			CALLED SIDO-DYAS, HAVE YOU, MASTER?

				MACE WINDU
			NO. WHOEVER PLACED THAT ORDER WAS
			NOT A JEDI, I CAN ASSURE YOU.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I HAVE A STRONG FEELING THAT THIS
			BOUNTY HUNTER IS THE ASSASSIN
			WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

				YODA
			WHO HE IS WORKING FOR... DISCOVER
			THAT, YOU MUST.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I WILL, MASTER, AND I WILL ALSO
			FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS CLONE
			ARMY... MAY THE FORCE...

THE HOLOGRAM SWITCHES OFF, AND OBI-WAN FADES AWAY.

				WINDU
			A CLONE ARMY! ORDERED BY SOMEONE
			IN THE SENATE PERHAPS... SOMEONE'S
			OUT TO START A WAR.

				YODA
			INFORM THE CHANCELLOR OF THIS, WE
			MUST.

				WINDU
			WHO DO YOU THINK THIS IMPOSTOR
			SIDO-DYAS, COULD BE?

YODA STARES BACK AT MACE WINDU, THEN SLOWLY SHAKES HIS HEAD.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT - NIGHT
THE SILENT LODGE. THE TRIPLE MOONS OF NABOO REFLECTED IN THE TRANQUIL WATERS OF THE LAKE.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN MOVES RESTLESSLY IN HIS SLEEP. HE MUTTERS TO HIMSELF. SWEAT
FORMS ON HIS FOREHEAD. HE TURNS VIOLENTLY. HE CRIES OUT.

				ANAKIN
			NO...NO...NO...MOM!...DON'T,
			NO, DON'T!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS - MORNING
ANAKIN IS ON THE BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE GARDENS. AFTER A MOMENT, PAMDE COMES ONTO THE BALCONY BEHIND HIM. SHE SEES HE IS MEDITATING AND TURNS TO GO.

				ANAKIN
				(EYES CLOSED)
			DON'T GO.

				PAMDE
			I DON'T WANT TO DISTURB YOU.

				ANAKIN
			YOUR PRESENCE IS SOOTHING.

BRIEF PAUSE.

				PADME
			YOU HAD A NIGHTMARE AGAIN LAST
			NIGHT.

				ANAKIN
			JEDI DON'T HAVE NIGHTMARES.

				PADME
			I HEARD YOU.

ANAKIN'S OPENS HIS EYES AND LOOKS AT HER.

				ANAKIN
			I SAW MY MOTHER. I SAW HER AS
			CLEARLY AS I SEE YOU NOW. SHE'S
			SUFFERING, PADME. SHE IS IN
			PAIN...THEY'RE KILLING HER!
				(GETTING UP)
			I KNOW I'M DISOBEYING MY MANDATE
			TO PROTECT YOU, SENATOR. I KNOW I
			WILL BE PUNISHED AND POSSIBLY
			THROWN OUT OF THE JEDI ORDER, BUT
			I MUST GO. I HAVE TO HELP HER!
			I'M SORRY, PADME. I DON'T HAVE A
			CHOICE.

				PADME
			ANNIE, I TOLD YOU I WOULDN'T LET
			YOU GIVE UP YOUR FUTURE FOR ME.
			I'LL GO WITH YOU. THAT WAY YOU
			CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT ME, AND
			YOU WON'T BE DISOBEYING YOUR
			MANDATE.

				ANAKIN
			WHAT ABOUT MASTER OBI-WAN?

PADME SMILES AND TAKES HIS HAND.

				PADME
			I GUESS WE WON'T TELL HIM, WILL WE?

EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY
ANAKIN AND PADME STEP ONTO THE LANDING PLATFORM FROM THE WATER SPEEDER. THEY ENTER THE NABOO STARSHIP. ARTOO BEEPS, AND FOLLOWS THEM ON BOARD. THE RAMP RETRACTS.

TAUN WE CONDUCTS OBI-WAN TO THE DOOR OF JANGO FETT'S APARTMENT. TAUN WE WAVES HIS HAND, AND A MUTED BELL RINGS.

AS THEY WAIT, OBI-WAN NOTES THE DOOR LOCK ENTRY MECHANISM. THEN THE DOOR OPENS, AND A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY, BOBA FETT, LOOKS AT THEM. HE IS IDENTICAL TO THE BOYS IN THE CLASSROOM.

				TAUN WE
			BOBA, IS YOUR FATHER HERE?

THERE IS A BRIEF PAUSE, THEN BOBA FETT NODS.

				TAUN WE
				(CONTINUING)
			MAY WE SEE HIM?

				BOBA FETT
			SURE.

ANOTHER BRIEF PAUSE, THEN BOBA FETT STEPS ASIDE, AND TAUN WE AND OBI-WAN GO THROUGH.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, AND BOBA FETT ENTER THE APARTMENT. OBI-WAN LOOKS AROUND THE ROOM.

				BOBA FETT
			DAD! TAUN WE'S HERE!

JANGO FETT COMES IN FROM THE BEDROOM. HE WEARS A JUMPSUIT. HE IS UNSHAVEN AND MEAN LOOKING, HIS FACE PITTED WITH SCARS OF OLD WOUNDS. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WEIRD TATTOOS ON HIS MUSCULAR FOREARMS. HE EYES OBI-WAN WITH SUSPICION.

				TAUN WE
			WELCOME BACK, JANGO. WAS YOUR
			TRIP PRODUCTIVE?

				JANGO FETT
			FAIRLY.

OBI-WAN AND JANGO FETT SIZE EACH OTHER UP. BOBA FETT STUDIES BOTH OF THEM.

				TAUN WE
			THIS IS JEDI MASTER, OBI-WAN
			KENOBI. HE'S COME TO CHECK ON OUR
			PROGRESS.

				JANGO FETT
			THAT RIGHT?

JANGO FETT'S EYES FIX OBI-WAN COLDLY.

				OBI-WAN
			YOUR CLONES ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE.
			YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD.

				JANGO FETT
			I'M JUST A SIMPLE MAN, TRYING TO
			MAKE MY WAY IN THE UNIVERSE,
			MASTER JEDI.

				OBI-WAN
			AREN'T WE ALL?

OBI-WAN EYES THE HALF-OPEN BEDROOM DOOR, THROUGH WHICH A COUPLE OF PIECES OF BODY ARMOUR CAN BE SEEN ON THE FLOOR. JANGO FETT REGISTERS OBI-WAN'S LOOK. HE MOVES IN FRONT OF HIM, BLOCKING THE VIEW.

				OBI-WAN
				(CONTINUING)
			EVER MADE YOUR WAY AS FAR INTO THE
			INTERIOR AS CORUSCANT?

				JANGO
			ONCE OR TWICE.

				OBI-WAN
			RECENTLY?

				JANGO
				(EYES OBI-WAN CAREFULLY)
			POSSIBLY...

				OBI-WAN
			THEN YOU MUST KNOW MASTER SIDO-
			DYAS?

				JANGO
			BOBA, CLOSE THE DOOR.

BOBA FETT MOVES TO CLOSE THE BEDROOM DOOR. JANGO FETT SMILES THINLY AT OBI-WAN.

				JANGO
				(CONTINUING)
			MASTER WHO?

				OBI-WAN
			SIDO-DYAS. ISN�T HE THE JEDI WHO
			HIRED YOU FOR THIS JOB?

				JANGO
			NEVER HEARD OF HIM. I WAS
			RECUITED BY A MAN CALLED DARTH
			TYRANUS ON ONE OF THE MOONS OF
			BOGDEN.

				OBI-WAN
			NO? I THOUGHT...

				TAUN WE
			SIDO-DYAS TOLD US TO EXPECT HIM.
			AND HE SHOWED UP JUST WHEN YOUR
			JEDI MASTER SAID HE WOULD. WE
			HAVE KEPT THE JEDI�S INVOLVEMENT
			A SECRET UNTIL YOUR ARRIVAL, JUST
			AS YOUR MASTER REQUESTED.

				OBI-WAN
			CURIOUS...

				JANGO
			DO YOU LIKE YOUR ARMY?

				OBI-WAN
			IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S YOUR ARMY -
			BEING THAT THEY ARE ALL CLONES OF
			YOU.

				JANGO
				(GRINNING)
			THEY'LL DO THEIR JOB WELL, I'LL
			GUARANTEE THAT.

				OBI-WAN
			I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THEM IN
			ACTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
			JANGO.

				JANGO
			ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO MEET A JEDI.

OBI-WAN AND TAUN WE GO OUT. THE DOOR SLIDES CLOSED. JANGO FETT TURNS TO HIS SON. HE IS DEEP IN THOUGHT.

				BOBA
			WHAT IS IT, DAD?

EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY

				ANAKIN
				(TO THE DROID DRIVER)
			WAIT, PLEASE.

ANAKIN AND PADME GET DOWN. SITTING ON A STOOL IN FRONT OF THE SHOP IS WATTO. HE IS USING A SMALL ELECTRONIC SCREWDRIVER ON A FIDDLY DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS ARE CHATTERING AWAY AND ARE TRYING TO HELP HIM, BUT THEY SEEM ONLY TO MAKE HIM MADDER.

				WATTO
				(YELLING, IN HUTTESE)
			NO, NOT THAT ONE - THAT ONE!

				ANAKIN
				(ARRIVING)
			EXCUSE ME, WATTO.

				WATTO
				(IN HUTTESE)
			WHAT?

				ANAKIN
				(IN HUTTESE)
			I SAID EXCUSE ME.

WATTO TURNS TO THE CHATTERING PIT DROIDS.

				WATTO
				(IN HUTTESE)
			SHUT DOWN.

THE PIT DROIDS SNAP INTO THEIR STORAGE POSITION.

				WATTO
				(CONTINUING, IN HUTTESE)
			WHAT? I DON'T KNOW YOU... WHAT CAN
			I DO FOR YOU? YOU LOOK LIKE A
			JEDI. WHATEVER IT IS... I DIDN'T
			DO IT.

WATTO DROPS THE SCREWDRIVER AND CURSES LOUDLY IN HUTTESE

				ANAKIN
			LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT.

ANAKIN TAKES THE FIDDLY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND STARTS TO PLAY WITH IT. WATTO BLINKS IN SURPRISE.

				ANAKIN
				(CONTINUING)
			I'M LOOKING FOR SHMI SKYWALKER.

WATTO LOOKS AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY. HE STARES AT PADME, THEN BACK TO ANAKIN.

				WATTO
			ANNIE?? LITTLE ANNIE?? NAAAAH!!

SUDDENLY, THE FIDDLY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN ANAKIN'S HANDS WHIRS INTO LIFE. WATTO BLINKS AT IT.

				WATTO
				(CONTINUING; IN ENGLISH)
			YOU ARE ANNIE! IT IS YOU! YOU
			LITTLE WOMP RAT.

WATTO GIVES ANAKIN A BIG HUG.

				WATTO
				(CONTINUING)
			YOU SURE SPROUTED WEEHOO! A
			JEDI! WADDYA KNOW? HEY, MAYBE
			YOU COULDDA HELP WIT SOME
			DAEDBEATS WHO OWE...

				ANAKIN

				ANAKIN

				WATTO
			YEARS AGO. SORRY, ANNE, BUT YOU

			SOLD HER TO A MOISTURE FARMER
			NAMED LARS. LEAST I THINK IT WAS
			LARS. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I HEARD
			HE FREED HER AND MARRIED HER. CAN

				ANAKIN
			DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?

				WATTO
			LONG WAY FROM HERE... SOMEPLACE
			OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MOS
			EISLEY, I THINK...

				ANAKIN
			I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

ANAKIN'S GRIM LOOK MEANS BUSINESS; WATTO GETS THE HINT QUICKLY.

				WATTO
			YEAH... SURE... ABSOLUTELY. LET'S
			GO LOOK IN MY RECORDS.

ANAKIN AND WATTO GO INTO THE SHOP.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN COMES OUT FROM THE TOWER INTO THE DRIVING RAN. THE DOOR CLOSES BEHIND HIM. HE PULLS HIS ROBE AROUND HIM AND STANDS BRACED AGAINST THE GALE.

BELOW, A HUGE WAVE CRASHES AGAINST THE STILTS. SPRAY FLIES HIGH AND WHIPS ACROSS THE PLATFORM WHERE OBI-WAN IS STANDING. HE WALKS OVER TO HIS STARFIGHTER, LOOKS TO SEE IF ANYONE IS WATCHING, THEN TURNS AND GOES BACK TO THE DOOR. IT SLIDES OPEN.

OBI-WAN WALKS IN TO FIND THE ROOM IN COMPLETE DISORDER. THE BEDROOM DOOR IS WIDE OPEN - CLEAR SIGNS OF HURRIED DEPARTURE. ALL OF THE FETTS' PERSONAL BELONGINGS ARE GONE.

OBI-WAN GOES TO AN ULTRA-THIN COMPUTER SCREEN. HE PUNCHES UP AN ONSCREEN PICTURE OF JANGO FETT AND BOBA FETT UNHITCHING THE LINES SECURING THEIR SHIP TO THE LANDING PLATFORM. JANGO FETT IS WEARING HIS ARMOUR AND ROCKET PACK. BOBA FETT CLIMBS ABOARD THE SMALL FIGHTER.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
JANGO FETT PICKS UP A CASE AND SWINGS IT UP TO BOBA FETT, WHO STOWS IT INSIDE THE SHIP. JANGO FETT PICKS UP ANOTHER CASE AND IS ABOUT TO SWING IT, WHEN:

				BOBA FETT
			DAD!!

JANGO FETT TURNS TO SEE OBI-WAN CHARGING OUT OF THE TOWER TOWARD HIM. AS HE RUNS, OBI-WAN DRAWS HIS LIGHTSABER FROM HIS BELT. IT FLASHES ON.

JANGO FETT DRAWS HIS GUN AND FIRES AT THE CHARGING JEDI. OBI-WAN DEFLECTS THE BLAST AND SWINGS AT JANGO FETT.

THE BOUNTY HUNTER ROCKETS UP AND OVER OBI-WAN, LANDING BEHIND HIM. HE FIRES A THIN WIRE FROM HIS WRIST PACK, TRYING TO ENTANGLE THE JEDI.

JANGO FETT FIRE SEVERAL KAMINO KYBER DARTS FROM HIS ELBOW LAUNCHER. OBI-WAN DEFLECTS THEM BACK AT JANGO FETT, BUT THEY STRIKE HARMLESSLY AGAINST THE BOUNTY HUNTER'S ARMOUR.

IN THE COCKPIT OF JANGO FETT'S SHIP, BOBA FETT GRABS THE CONTROLS OF A LASER GUN AND SWINGS IT TO AIM AT OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, IN THE DRIVING RAIN, OBI-WAN AND JANGO FETT CIRCLE EACH OTHER, SIZING EACH OTHER UP - FEINTING.

IN THE COCKPIT, EACH TIME BOBA FETT IS READY TO FIRE, JANGO FETT BLOCKS HIS VIEW OF OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN MAKES A SUDDEN ATTACK, SWINGING AT JANGO FETT, WHO DEFLECTS THE BLOWS. ONE SLICES OFF A PIECE OF THE BOUNTY HUNTER'S SHOULDER PLATE. JANGO FETT ROCKETS INTO THE AIR AND HOVERS ABOVE OBI-WAN. THE JEDI SPINS AS:

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT FIRES.

OUTSIDE, THE LASER SHELL STREAKS PAST OBI-WAN TO STRIKE THE EDGE OF THE TOWER. JANGO FETT FIRES DOWN AT OBI-WAN. THE JEDI DEFLECTS THE SHOTS BACK, BUT JANGO FETT EVADES THEM. THEN HE SWOOPS DOWN, SWINGING AROUND OBI-WAN. AS HE SHOOTS PAST, HE KICKS THE LIGHTSABER OUT OF THE JEDI'S HAND.

THE LIGHTSABER SKIDS ACROSS THE WET SURFACE OF THE LANDING PLATFORM. OBI-WAN DIVES AFTER IT. JANGO FETT ZOOMS IN FRONT OF HIM AND GRABS THE LIGHTSABER. OBI-WAN PUNCHES IT OUT OF HIS HAND.

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT WATCHES AS:

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN AND JANGO FETT GRAPPLE AND FIGHT, PUNCHING, KICKING, GRABBING HOLD, AND THROWING EACH OTHER AROUND. OBI-WAN GRABS JANGO FETT TIGHTLY, AND JANGO FETT ROCKETS UP INTO THE AIR AND KICKS OBI-WAN LOOSE. OBI-WAN CRASHES TO THE DECK AND SLIDES TOWARD THE EDGE. HE GRAPPLES DESPERATELY FOR A HANDHOLD ON THE SLICK SURFACE.

JANGO FETT ROCKETS DOWN TO KICK AT HIM. OBI-WAN HAULS HIMSELF UP. JANGO FETT ZOOMS TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE PLATFORM.

OBI-WAN USES JEDI POWERS TO PULL PART OF THE STRUCTURE LOOSE. IT HITS JANGO FETT, WHO LOSES HIS BALANCE, TEETERING ON THE EDGE. OBI-WAN CHARGES ACRESS, DIVES, AND GRABS HOLD OF JANGO FETT JUST AS HE FALLS OVER THE EDGE.

LOCKED TOGETHER, OBI-WAN AND JANGO FETT PLUMMET DOWN TOWARD THE RAGING OCEAN. AT THE LAST MOMENT, JANGO FETT FIRES A CABLE OUT OF HIS BACKPACK THAT SHOOTS UPWARD AND LOCKS ONTO A METAL STRUT ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE PLATFORM. OBI-WAN AND JANGO FETT SWING AND CRASH ONTO ONE OF THE STILTS.

OBI-WAN IS KNOCKED CLEAR AND DROPS ONTO A SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM JUST ABOVE THE WAVES. HE HAULS HIMSELF TO HIS FEET. JANGO FETT HOVERS IN MID-AIR OPPOSITE HIM, AS A HUGE WAVE CRASHES OVER OBI-WAN. WHEN IT SUBSIDES, THE JEDI HAS DISAPPEARED.

JANGO FETT ROCKETS UP TO THE LANDING PLATFORM, WHERE HE DROPS DOWN BESIDE HIS SHIP. HE CLAMBERS INSIDE THE COCKPIT AND SETTLES INTO THE PILOT'S SEAT. HE PUNCHES BUTTONS. THE ENGINES ROAR.

OUTSIDE, JANGO FETT'S SHIP LIFTS OFF FROM THE PLATFORM AND HEADS UP INTO THE LOWERING SKY. IT DISAPPEARS. LIGHTNING FLASHES. RAIN LASHES THE TOWER AND STREAMS ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THE PLATFORM, TO WHERE:

A HAND SUDDENLT CLUTCHES AT THE VERY EDGE OF THE PLATFORM. A MOMENT LATER, ANOTHER HAND GRABS HOLD.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY
THE NABOO STARSHIP DESCENDS, HOVERS, AND LAND ON A BLUFF. ANAKIN AND PADME GET OUT. THEY LOOK DOWN FROM THE EDGE OF THE BLUFF TO WHERE THE HOMESTEAD IS SEEN ON THE DESERT FLOOR BELOW.

				PADME
			STAY WITH THE SHIP, ARTOO.

ARTOO WHISTLES AS ANAKIN AND PADME START DOWN THE TRAIL TOWARD THE HOMESTEAD.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
C-3PO IS WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOMESTEAD. HE STILL LACKS AN OUTER COVERING; HIS INNER PARTS AND WIRING SHOW. HE LOOKS UP AS ANAKIN AND PADME ARRIVE,

				C-3PO
			GOOD EVENING. MAY I HELP YOU?

				ANAKIN
			THREEPIO?

				C-3PO
			OH, MY... OH, MY! MASTER
			ANAKIN! MY GOODNESS, I CAN HARDLY
			BELIEVE IT! AND THIS MUST BE MISS
			PADME.

				PADME
			HELLO, THREEPIO.

				ANAKIN
			I'VE COME TO SEE MY MOTHER.

				C-3PO
			OH, DEAR! I'M SO TERRIBLY SORRY,
			MASTER ANNIE.

				PADME
			THREEPIO, WHAT'S HAPPENED?

				C-3PO
			I THINK WE'D BETTER GO INSIDE.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME AND THREEPIO ARRIVE IN THE COURTYARD. THREEPIO SHUFFLES AHEAD.

				C-3PO
			MASTER LARS - MASTER OWEN!
			SOMEBODY TO SEE YOU!

OWEN LARS AND BERU WHITESUN COME OUT INTO THE COURTYARD.

				ANAKIN
			I'M ANAKIN SKYWALKER. I'M HERE
			LOOKING FOR MY MOTHER.

				OWEN
			OWEN LARS... I GUESS I'M YOUR
			STEP-BROTHER.
				(THEY SHAKE HANDS)
			THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND, BERU.

				BERU
			HELLO.

				PADME
			I'M PADME.

				OWEN
			I HAD A FEELING YOU MIGHT SHOW UP
			SOME DAY.

				ANAKIN
			IS MY MOTHER HERE?

				CLIEGG
			NO, SHE'S NOT.

CLIEGG LARS SWINGS FROM THE HOUSE ON A SMALL FLOATING CHAIR. ONE OF HIS LEGS IS HEAVILY BANDAGED; THE OTHER IS MISSING. HE BALANCES AWKWARDLY AND PUTS OUT A HAND.

				CLIEGG
				(CONTINUING)
			CLIEGG LARS. SHMI IS MY WIFE...
			COME ON INSIDE. WE HAVE A LOT TO
			TALK ABOUT.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY
BERU PUTS SEVERAL STEAMING CUPS OF ARDEES ON A TRAY AND EXITS THE KITCHEN...

				CLIEGG (O.S.)
			IT WAS JUST BEFORE DAWN. THEY
			CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. A HUNTING
			PARTY OF TUSEKN RAIDERS.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY
CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME AND ANAKIN SIT AROUND THE TABLE, BERU BRINGS THE DRINKS FROM THE KITCHEN.

				CLIEGG
			YOUR MOTHER HAD GONE OUT EARLY,
			LIKE SHE ALWAYS DID, TO PICK
			MUSHROOMS THAT GROW ON THE
			VAPORATOS. FROM THE TRACKS, SHE
			WAS ABOUT HALFWAY WHEN THEY
			TOOK HER. THOSE TUSKENS WALK LIKE
			MEN, BUT THEY'RE VICIOUS, MINDLESS
			MONSTERS. THIRTY OF US WENT OUT
			AFTER HER. FOUR OF US CAME BACK.
			THREE MORE ARE STILL OUT THERE
			LOOKING. I'D BE WITH THEM,
			ONLY... I JUST COULDN'T RIDE ANY
			MORE... UNTIL I HEAL.

CLIEGG GRIMACES, EASING HIS THROBBING LEG.

				CLIEGG
				(CONTINUING)
			THIS ISN'T THE WAY I WANTED TO
			MEET YOU, SON. THIS ISN'T HOW
			YOUR MOTHER AND I PLANNED IT. I
			DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP ON HER, BUT
			SHE'S BEEN GONE A MONTH. THERE'S
			LITTLE HOPE SHE'S LASTED THIS LONG.

SILENCE. THEN ANAKIN STANDS UP.

				OWEN
			WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

				ANAKIN
			TO FIND MY MOTHER.

				PADME
			NO, ANNIE!

				CLIEGG
			SHE'S DAED, SON. ACCEPT IT.

				ANAKIN
			I CAN FEEL HER PAIN, AND I WILL
			FIND HER. I KNOW SHE'S ALIVE.

ANAKIN TURNS ABRUPTLY.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN STANDS LOOKING ACROSS THE DESERT. PADME COMES RUNNING OUT OF THE HOMESTEAD AFTER HIM, FOLLOWED BY OWEN. ANAKIN TURNS TO PADME.

				ANAKIN
			YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STAY
			HERE. THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE,
			PADME. YOU'LL BE SAFE.

				OWEN
			TAKE MY SPEEDER BIKE.

				PADME
			ANAKIN...

PADME HUGS HIM. ANAKIN WALKS OVER TO OWEN'S SPEEDER BIKE, WHICH IS STANDING CLOSE BY.

				ANAKIN
			I TRUST YOU'LL WATCH OVER HER,
			OWEN.

				OWEN
			DON'T WORRY.

ANAKIN SWINGS ONTO THE BIKE. THE ENGINE FIRES.

				ANAKIN
			I WON'T BE LONG.

ANAKIN TAKES OFF ACROSS THE DESERT. PADME WATCHES HIM GO.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
THE RED PLANET OF GEONOSIS IS CIRCLED BY A LARGE ASTEROID FIELD THAT FORM RINGS. JANGO FETT'S SHIP APPEARS, HEADING TOWARD IT.

INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS
JANGO FETT GRINS AT BOBA FETT.

				JANGO FETT
			NEARLY THERE, SON.

JANGO FETT GUIDES HE SHIP AROUND THE ASTEROIDS. SUDDENLY:

				BOBA FETT
			DAD, LOOK!!

ON THE VIEW SCREEN, OBI-WAN'S SHIP APPEARS, CHASING AFTER THEM. JANGO FETT GRABS THE CONTROLS. THEY ARE THROWN AROUND AS THE SHIP PLUMMETS TO TRY TO LOSE OBI-WAN.

				JANGO FETT
			HANG ON!

THE SHIP GOES INTO A POWER-CLIMB. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ENSUES BETWEEN OBI-WAN AND JANGO FETT.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
THE SHIPS FLIP, ROLL, AND TURN AT INCREDIBLE SPEED, DIDGING, WEAVING AND FIRING. THEY TUMBLE FROM NEAR MISSES. HITS FLY OFF OBI-WAN'S FIGHTER AS ONE OF JANGO'S MISSILES GETS THROUGH.

FINALLY, IT SEEMS AS IF OBI-WAN IS GETTING THE UPPER HAND. JANGO FETT BREAKS OFF THE FIGHT AND DIVES SHARPLY. HE MANEUVERS DEFTLY BETWEEN TWO HUGE ASTEROIDS.

IN JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT FLINCHES AS ASTEROIDS PASS VERY CLOSE BY.

				BOBA FETT
			DAD! WATCH OUT!

				JANGO FETT
			STAY CALM, SON. WE'LL BE FINE.
			THAT JEDI WON'T BE ABLE TO FOLLOW
			US THROUGH THIS.

BUT OBI-WAN SHIP DIVES INTO THE ASTEROID BELT AFTER THEM.

IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, HIS SKILL IS PUSHED TO THE LIMIT AS HE THROWS THE SHIP FROM SIDE TO SIDE, AVOIDING GREAT ROCKS. THEN A HUGE ASTEROID TUMBLES ACROSS HIS PATH. THERE SEEM NO WAY HE CAN AVOID IT. OBI-WAN FIRES A COUPLE OF AERIAL TORPEDOES. THEY STREAK TOWARD THE ASTEROID.

IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, THEY SEE THE HUGE EXPLOSION AS OBI-WAN'S SHIP APPEARS TO SMASH INTO THE ASTEROID.

				BOBA FETT
			GOT HIM! YEAHHHHH!

				JANGO FETT
			WE WON'T SEE HIM AGAIN.

BOBA FETT LAUGHS. JANGO FETT'S SHIP EMERGES FROM THE ASTEROID BELT AND HEADS DOWN TOWARD THE PLANET OF GEONOSIS.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET
ANAKIN STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CROWD OF JAWAS. HE ASKS THEM FROM DIRECTIONS. THE JAWAS CONFER EXICITEDLY, THEN THE CHIEF JAWA POINTS IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION. ANAKIN GETS ON THE BIKE AND SPEEDS OFF TO WHERE THE JAWA POINTED.

EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT
ANAKIN RIDES OVER A LARGE DUNE TOWARD A SMALL FLICKERING LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE.

HE RIDES UP AND STOPS THE BIKE IN FRONT OF A CAMPFIRE. THERE ARE BODIES OF THREE DEAD FARMERS LYING BESIDE THE CAMPFIRE. TWO EOPIES ARE THETHERED NEARBY, ALONG WITH A BURNED AND SMOKING SPEEDER.

EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN RIDS THE SPEEDER BIKE THROUGH THREE EXOTIC LANDSCAPES. IN ONE SHOT, HE STOPS AND LOOKS DOWN AT SOME TRACKS. THEN HE STARTS UP HIS SPEEDER AND RIDES OFF.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
THE LIGHTS OF THE VAPORATORS BLINK IN THE NIGHT SKY. SOMEWHERE CLOSE BY, A NIGHT ANIMAL HOWLS.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME IS PACING THE COURTYARD RESTLESSLY. SHE STOPS, LISTENING TO THE ANIMAL HOWLING NEARBY. SHE SHIVERS SLIGHTLY, THEN TURNS AND GOES INTO THE GARAGE AT THE SIDE OF THE COURTYARD.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME STANDS LOOKING AT A SPEEDER PARKED IN THE GARAGE. SHORT SILENCE. THEN:

				C-3PO
			PLEASE DON'T LEAVE US, MISS PADME.
			THESE PEOPLE NEED YOUR HELP.

THREEPIO IS PARKED IN A CORNER.

				PADME
			I'M NOT LEAVING, THREEPIO. I JUST
			CAN'T SLEEP.

				C-3PO
			THAT'S SOMETHING I CANNOT RELATE
			TO. AS A PROTOCOL DROID, I'M
			EITHER ACTIVE OR INACTIVE.
			THERE'S NO IN-BETWEEN.

				PADME
			I GUESS YOU'RE LUCKY.

				C-3PO
			DO YOU REALLY THINK SO..? I
			SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T EXPECT...

				PADME
			YOU'RE NOT HAPPY HERE?

				C-3PO
			OH, I'M NOT UNHAPPY... AND MY
			MASTERS HERE AR SO KIND I
			WOULDN'T WISH TO TROUUBLE THEM,
			IT'S JUST... BEING LIKE THIS...
			WELL, IT'S EMBARRASSING.

				PADME
			BEING LIKE WHAT?

				C-3PO
			NAKED. IF YOU PARDON THE
			EXPRESSION. YOU SEE, WHEN MASTER
			ANNIE MADE ME, HE NEVER QUITE
			FOUND THE TIME TO GIVE ME ANY
			OUTER COVERING. IT'S SO
			HUMILIATING. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT
			IF YOU HAD TO GO AROUND WITH ALL
			YOUR CIRCUITS SHOWING?

				PADME
			I GUESS I WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

				C-3PO
			OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T. NOBODY
			WOULD. IT'S SIMPLY NOT PROTOCOL.

PADME LOOKS THOUGHTFULLY AT A PILE OF SPARE PARTS AND BITS OF METAL AND TOOLS.

				PADME
			MAYBE WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

				C-3PO
			I DON'T THINK SO. ONLY MASTER
			ANNIE...

				PADME
			WHY NOT? THEY SEEM TO HAVE A BOX
			OF OLD COVERINGS HERE.

				C-3PO
			OH? HOW OBSERVANT OF YOU, MISS
			PADME. OF COURSE, I'M JUST NOT
			MECHANICALLY MINDED... IF YOU SEE
			WHAT I MEAN.

PADME PICKS UP A PIECE OF METAL AND HOLDS IT AGAINST HIM.

				PADME
			LET'S SEE, IF WE PUT THIS...
			HERE...

				C-3PO
			OOOOH! THAT'S TICKLES.

				PADME
			YOU'LL HAVE TO BE QUIET, THREEPIO.
			HOLD STILL, PLEASE.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
A HUGE CHUNK OF ROCK TUMBLES SLOWLY THROUGH THE ASTEROID BELY. CAMERA CLOSES, TO DISCOVER OBI-WAN'S STARSHIP HIDDEN IN A BLASTED-OUT AREA ON THE PITTED BACK SIDE OF THE GREAT ROCK.

INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
OBI-WAN LOOKS OUT TOWARD GEONOSIS AND SEES IN THE DISTANCE A LARGE FLEET OF TRADE FEDERATION SHIPS HIDDEN AMONG THE ASTEROIDS. HE STARTS THE ENGINES OF HIS FIGHTER.

OBI-WAN'S FIGHTER MOVES OUT FROM THE BACK SIDE OF THE ASTEROID AND HEADS AWAY FROM THE ASTEROID FIELD, DESCENDING TOWARD GEONOSIS.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
OBI-WAN'S SHIP SKIMS ACROSS THE TOP OF A SMALL MESA ALONG THE EDGE OF A ROCKY RIDGE. HE MANEUVERS UNDER A ROCK OVERHANG AND LANDS. HE GETS OUT OF THE FIGHTER AND WALKS ONTO THE MESA. THE WIND WHIPS AT HIM. HE LOOKS AROUND.

GEONOSIS IS A RED ROCK PLANET, FEATURELESS APART FROM BUTTES AND MESAS, AND OCCASIONAL TALL STALAGMITES THAT STAND OUT DRAMATICALLY ON THE ARID PLAINS.

THE NIGHT IS QUIET, EXCEPT FOR AN OCCASIONAL WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN CHECKS HIS BEARINGS, THEN HEADS AWAY.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN CLIMBS A STEEP, NARROW TRAIL. SUDDENLY, A CRY IS HEARD CLOSE BY. OBI-WAN STUMBLES SLIGHTLY. HIS FOOT SLIPS ON THE EDGE, SENDING A STREAM OF PEBLLES SKITTERING INTO THE DARKNESS.

OBI-WAN LISTENS. SILENCE. HE DRAWS HIS LIGHTSABER BUT DOES NOT IGNITE IT.

HE SETS OFF AGAIN AND WORKS HIS WAY AROUND A NARROW CORNER, TO CONFRONT A CROUCHING MASSIFF (A DOG-SIZED LIZARD) WITH SLAVERING FANGS! THE BEAST LEAPS AT HIM, AND OBI-WAN IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER AS THE MASSIFF KNOCKS HIM ON HIS BACK. ITS JAWS OPEN WIDE. OBI-WAN STABS THE CREATURE, THROWS IT OFF OF HIM, AND JUMPS UP.

A SECOND MASSIFF JUMPS FROM BEHIND. OBI-WAN SWINGS AROUND AND CUTS IT IN HALF. THE MASSIFF FLIES OVER THE CLIFF, HOWLING. IT PLUMMETS TO ITS DEATH HUNDREDS OF FEET BELOW.

EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN PULLS UP NEAR THE EDGE OF A CLIFF. HE GETS OFF THE BIKE AND CREEPS TO THE EDGE. HE LOOKS OVER TO SEE A TUSKEN CAMP IN THE OASIS BELOW. ONE OF THE HUTS AT THE EDGE OF THE CAMP HAS TWO TUSKEN GUARDS OUTSIDE IT.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN CREEPS THROUGH THE CAMP, WORKING HIS WAY FROM HUT TO HUT, FLATTENING HIMSELF AGAINST THE WALL,S OVERHEARING SNATCHES OF TUSKEN CONVERSATION FROM INSIDE, USING THE SHADOWS TO HIM HIM UNTIL HE ARRIVES AT THE HUT WITH THE TWO GUARDS. THEY ARE SITTING A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DOOR. ANAKIN WRIGGLES AROUND THE BLACK. HE TAKES OUT HIS LIGHTSABER AND CUTS INTO THE BASE OF THE WALL.

INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT
THE LIGHTSABER COMPLETES THE HOLE IN THE WALL. ANAKIN WRIGGLES IN. HE PULLS HIMSELF TO HIS FEET. THERE ARE CANDLES EVERYWHERE.

A SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF PIERCES THE GLOOM OF THE HUT. BY ITS LIGHT, ANAKIN SEES SHMI, HANGING FROM A WOODEN FRAME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HUT.

HE CUTS HER FREE, TAKES HER INTO HIS ARMS, AND LOWERS HER GENTLY TO THE GROUND. HER EYES ARE CLOSED. HER FACE IS BLOODIED. SHE HAS BEEN
TERRIBLY BEATEN. ANAKIN CRADLES HER TENDERLY.

				ANAKIN
			MOM... MOM... MOM...

SHMI'S EYELIDS FLUTTER - AND BARELY OPEN. THEY ARE CAKED WITH BLOOD.

				SHMI
			ANNIE...? IS IT YOU?

SHMI'S EYES FOCUS SLOWLY. ANAKIN GIVES A LITTLE CHOKING GASP.

				ANAKIN
			I�M HERE, MOM. YOU�RE SAFE. HANG
			ON. I�M GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF
			HERE...

				SHMI
			I�M SO GLAD... TO SEE YOU,
			ANNIE... NOW... I AM COMPLETE...

				ANAKIN
			JUST STAY WITH ME, MOM. I�M GOING
			TO MAKE YOU WELL AGAIN.
			EVERYTHING�S GOING TO BE FINE.

				SHMI
			YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME. MY SON...
			MY GROWN-UP SON. I�M SO PROUD OF
			YOU, ANNIE... SO PROUD... I MISSED
			YOU SO MUCH... I LOVE...

SHMI DIES. ANAKIN DRAWS HER TO HIS BREAST. THERE IS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT. ANAKIN LIFTS HIS HEAD, LISTENING FOR A MOMENT, THEN HE SITS ON THE FLOOR OF THE TUSKEN HUT, CRADLING HIS DEAD MOTHER IN HIS ARMS.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN ARRIVES AT THE HEAD OF THE TRAIL. FAR BELOW, A FLAT PLAIN STRETCHES INTO THE DISTANCE. HE STOP, PEERING INTO THE DARKNESS, WHERE STRANGE SHAPES LOOM INDISTINCTLY.

OBI-WAN TAKES A PAIR OF ELECTRONIC BINOCULARS FROM HIS BELT AND PUTS THEM TO HIS EYES. HE SEES A CLUSTER OF GREAT TOWERS LIKE FANTASTIC STALAGMITES RISE FROM THE PLAIN BELOW.

SLOW PAN WITH THE BINOCULARS, AND SUDDENLY A LINE OF BATTLE STARSHIPS COME INTO VIEW. OBI-WAN TOUCHES THE VIEWFINDER. BETWEEN FIFTY AND A HUNDRED FEDERATION STARSHIPS IN NEAR ROWS. SOME ARE ON PLATFORMS THAT ARE CARRYING THE STARSHIPS DIWN TO AN UNDERGROUND FACILITY. OTHER PLATFORMS ARE RISING TO THE SURFACE. THEY CARRY THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS THAT STEP OFF AND FILE INTO THE WAITING SHIPS. A FULLY LOADED STARSHIP TAKES OFF. OBI-WAN SWINGS THE BINOCULARS UPWARD, TO SEE MORE FEDERATION STARSHIPS.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN
THE PALE LIGHT GROWS. THIN TENDRILS OF SMOKE RISE SLOWLY IN THE COLD, CLEAR AIR. SOMEWHERE AN DOG BARKS. AN OLD WOMAN COMES OUT OF ONE OF THE HUTS. SHE CARRIES A PAIL. SHE SWIRLS IT AND TOSSES THE DIRTY WATER ONTO THE GROUND.

AS SHE GOES BACK INSIDE THE HUT, A TUSKEN CHILD RUNS PAST, DRAGGING A STICK IN THE SAND. THE CHILD RUNS THROUGH THE LINE OF HUTS, TURNS A CORNER, AND STOPS SUDDENLY, STARING AT THE BODIES OF THE TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. BETWEEN THEM, ANAKIN STANDS OUTSIDE THE HUT DOOR. HIS FACE IS A GRIM MASK. THE CHILD STARES, THEN THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT AS ANAKIN�S LIGHTSABER SWITCHES ON.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
OBI-WAN COMES RUNNING BACK TO HIS SHIP AND CLIMBS INTO THE COCKPIT. HE SETTLES INTO HIS SEAT. HIS ARFOUR DROID BEEPS A HAPPY GREETING. OBI-WAN SWITCHES ON HIS COMLINK.

				OBI-WAN
			"GUIDING LIGHT" TO "OLD FOLKS
			HOME."

EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY
LOW ANGLE. A LINE OF REFLECTING POOLS WITH SPLASHING FOUNTAINS FLANKED BY STATUES ON EACH SIDE LEADS TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE AWESOME BUILDING.

INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE
A HOLOGRAM OF OBI-WAN FLICKERS IN FRONT OF A GROUP, MADE UP OF JEDI (YODA, MACE WINDU, AND KI-ADI-MUNDI) AND SENATORS (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, AND JAR JAR). PALPATINE AND MAS AMEDDA ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUP, WATCHING WITH GROWING CONCERN.

				OBI-WAN
			...STARSHIPS FROM THE TRADE
			FEDERATION AND THE COMMERCE GUILDS
			ARE TAKING DELIVERIES OF BATTLE
			DROIDS FROM THE FOUNDRIES ON
			GEONOSIS.

				BAIL ORGANA
			THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS! THE TREATY
			FORBIDS THE TRADE FEDERATION FROM
			BUILDING UP AN ARMY. WHAT ARE
			THEY DOING?!

				OBI-WAN
			THE DROID FOUNDRY SEEMS TO BE
			WORKING AT FULL CAPACITY. I AM
			GOING TO GO DOWN AND INVESTIGATE.
			I WILL BRING JANGO FETT BACK HOME
			FOR INTERROGATION.

				PALPATINE
			THOSE GEONOSIAN FOUNDRIES ARE PART
			OF THE TECHNO UNION. WE WILL CALL
			IN THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND ASK
			THEM A FEW VERY POINTED QUESTIONS.

				OBI-WAN
			ONE MORE THING. JANGO MENTIONED
			HE WAS RECRUITED BY SOMEONE NAMED
			DARTH TYRANUS. ANY IDEA WHO THAT
			MIGHT BE?

				YODA
			WITH THE FORENAME DARTH, A SITH HE
			MUST BE.

				MACE WINDU
			OUR MISSING APPRENTICE. THEY ARE
			PLAYING THEIR HAND AT LAST.

				OBI-WAN
			DO YOU BELIEVE HE COULD BE THE
			MYSTERIOUS SIDO-DYAS, WHO MADE THE
			DEAL FOR THE CLONE ARMY?

				YODA
			PERHAPS TOO MANY PIECES ARE MISSING
			FROM THIS PUZZLE, THERE ARE.

				MACE WINDU
			BE CAREFUL, OBI-WAN. THIS
			INVESTIGATION IS BECOMING LESS
			THAN ROUTINE. DO YOU NEED HELP?

				OBI-WAN
			LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIGURE OUT
			WHAT'S GOING ON FIRST.

THE HOLOGRAM OF OBI-WAN FADES OFF. PALPATINE STARES AT THE SPOT WHERE THE HOLOGRAM WAS IN DISBELIEF.

				BAIL ORGANA
			THE COMMERCE GUILDS ARE PREPARING
			FOR WAR... THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
			OF THAT.

				PALPATINE
			COUNT DOOKU MUST HAVE MADE A
			TREATY WITH THEM.

				MACE WINDU
			WE MUST STOP THEM SOON BEFORE
			THEY'RE FULLY READY.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			THE DEBATE IS OVER, WE NEED
			THAT CLONE ARMY NOW!

				BAIL ORGANA
			UNFORTUNATELY, THE DEBATE IS NOT
			OVER. THE SENATE WILL NEVER BE
			ABLE TO APPROVE THE USE OF THAT
			ARMY BEFORE THE SEPARATISTS
			ATTACK.

MAS AMEDDA, WHO HAD BEEN SILENT UP UNTIL NOW SUDDENLY SPEAKS UP.

				MAS AMEDDA
			THIS IS A CRISIS! IF THE SENATE
			VOTES THE CHANCELLOR EMERGENCY
			POWERS, HE COULD APPROVE THE USE
			OF THE ARMY IN A MINUTE.

				PALPATINE
			PLEASE, PLEASE, I DON'T WISH TO
			HAVE EMERGENCY POWERS. THAT'S TOO
			EXTREME A SOLUTION. IT'S AKIN TO
			A DICTATORSHIP. WE MUST RELY ON
			THE JEDI. MASTER YODA, HOW MANY
			ARE AVAILABLE TO GO TO GEONOSIS?

MACE WINDU AND YODA LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER.

				YODA
			TWO HUNDRED,... LESS OR MORE.

				BAIL ORGANA
			WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR THE JEDI
			ORDER, TWO HUNDRED WILL BE NO
			MATCH FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
			BATTLE DROIDS.

				MACE WINDU
			PATIENCE. WE SHOULD WAIT FOR OBI-
			WAN TO REPORT BACK. WE DON'T KNOW
			THAT COUNT DOOKU HAS MADE A TREATY
			WITH THE CORPORATE ALLIANCE, IT'S
			SPECULATION.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			BUT WE MUST PREPARE FOR THE WORST.
			I'M GOING TO PROPOSE A MOTION
			GRANTING EMERGENCY POWERS TO THE
			CHANCELLOR AT THE NEXT SESSION. WE
			MUST NOT WAIT!

				PALPATINE
			OUT OF THE QUESTION, SENATOR! YOU
			AND I ARE TOO CLOSELY ALIGNED.
			THE ISSUE WILL BECOME PARTISAN AND
			DEBATES WILL BEGIN. THE PROPOSAL
			MUST COME FROM A NEUTRAL SOURCE.

				MAS AMEDDA
			IF ONLY SENATOR AMIDALA WERE HERE.

JAR JAR STEPS FORWARD FROM THE BACK OF THE GROUP.

				JAR JAR
			SUPREME CHANCELLOR... MY AUGUST
			COLLEAGUES, I WOULD BE PROUD TO
			PROPOSE THE MOTION IN QUESTION.
			THIS IS A GRAVE SITUATION, AND I'M
			SURE SENATOR AMIDALA, AND THE
			QUEEN OF NABOO WOULD AGREE.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			THANK YOU, REPRESENTATIVE BINKS.

SILENCE. THEN PALPATINE SIGHS DEEPLY.

				PALPATINE
			IF CALLED UPON, I WILL SERVE. BUT
			IT WILL BE THE SADDEST DAY OF MY
			LIFE.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - DAY
ALL IS QUIET. BERU COMES OUT OF THE HOUSE. SHE GOES TO A MOISTURE LINE AND STARTS TO DRAW WATER.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
PADME FIXES THE LAST PIECE OF COVERING ONTO THREEPIO.

				PADME
			THERE!

PADME STANDS BACK. OWEN IS WITH HER. THEY LOOK AT THREEPIO. HE ISN'T THE GOLDEN FIGURE WE KNOW BECAUSE PADME HAS HAD TO USE WHATEVER STUFF SHE COULD FINDIN THE GARAGE. HE IS MULTI-COLOURED IN SEVERAL TEXTURES, BUT HE IS COMPLETE.

				C-3PO
			UM. HOW DO I LOOK?

				OWEN
			GREAT! YOU LOOK PERFECT.

				C-3PO
			PERFECT? OH, MISS PADME, I'M SO
			HAPPY!
				(EXTENDING HIS HAND TO SHAKE HERS)
			OH, PARDON ME.

THREEPIO DROPS HIS HAND AND BOWS FORMALLY.

				THREEPIO
				(CONTINUING)
			THANK YOU.

HE FORGETS FORMALITY AND HUGS HER. PADME HUGS HIM BACK, LAUGHING.

				C-3PO
				(CONTINUING)
			THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

				OWEN
				(GRINNING)
			WELL, PADME, I THINK HE SHOULD BE
			YOURS FROM NOW ON... I KNOW THAT
			IS WHAT MY MOM WOULD WANT.

				C-3PO
			OH, MY!

THEN SUDDENLY, FROM OUTSIDE:

				BERU (V.O.)
			COME TOPSIDE, EVERYBODY! HE'S
			BACK! HE'S BACK!

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
A ROUGH HOLOGRAM OF OBI-WAN IS PROJECTED ONTO THE GARAGE BY ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADME AND THREEPIO WATCH THE FLICKERING IMAGE.

				OBI-WAN
			...ALLIANCE HAVE PLEDGED THEIR
			ARMIES TO COUNT DOOKU AND ARE
			FORMING AN... WAIT!... AH...
			ATTACK... I DON'T... MAKE IT...
			AAAGGGHHH!

THE HOLOGRAM CUTS OFF. ANAKIN JUMPS UP, AGITATED.

				ANAKIN
			I'M GOING AFTER HIM!

				PADME
			I THOUGHT THE FIRST THING HE SAID
			WAS TO RETRANSMIT HIS MESSAGE TO
			CORUSCANT.

				ANAKIN
			YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME, ARTOO AND THREEPIO LEAVE THE HOMESTEAD, WAVING TO CLIEGG, OWEN AND BERU AS THEY GO INTO THE DESERT.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - SUNSET
ANAKIN SITS DOWN IN THE COCKPIT WITH PADME. THREEPIO IS BEHIND THEM. ARTOO IS BESIDE HIM. THEY ARE WATCHING A HOLOGRAM OF MACE WINDU.

				MACE WINDU
			WE WILL DEAL WITH COUNT DOOKU. THE
			MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR YOU,
			ANAKIN, IS TO STAY WHERE YOU ARE.
			PROTECT THE SENATOR AT ALL COSTS.
			THAT IS YOUR PRIORITY.

				ANAKIN
			UNDERSTOOD, MASTER.

THE HOLOGRAM SWITCHES OFF. PADME IS LOOKING AT THE READOUT ON THE SHIP'S CONTROL PANEL.

				PADME
			THEY'LL NEVER GET THERE IN TIME TO
			SAVE HIM. THEY HAVE TO COME HALF
			WAY ACROSS THE GALAXY. LOOK,
			GEONOSIS IS LESS THAN A PARSEC AWAY.

PADME STARTS TO HIT BUTTONS AND FLICK SWITCHES. ANAKIN PUTS A HAND OVER HERS, STOPPING HER. SHE STARES AT HIM.

				ANAKIN
			IF HE'S STILL ALIVE.

				PADME
			ANNIE, ARE YOU JUST GOING TO SIT
			HERE AND LET HIM DIE?? HE'S YOUR
			FRIEND... YOUR MENTOR...

				ANAKIN
			...HE'S LIKE MY FATHER, BUT YOU
			HEARD MASTER WINDU. HE GAVE ME
			STRICT ORDERS TO STAY HERE.

				PADME
			HE GAVE YOU STRICT ORDERS TO
			PROTECT ME...

PADME PULLS HER HAND FREE AND FLICKS MORE SWITCHES. THE ENGINES FIRE.

				PADME
				(CONTINUING)
			...AND I'M GOING TO SAVE OBI-WAN.
			SO IF YOU PLAN TO PROTECT ME, YOU
			WILL HAVE TO COME ALONG.

ANAKIN GRINS AND TAKES THE CONTROLS.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - SUNSET
THE NABOO STARSHIP RISES FROM THE BLUFF AND ZOOMS AWAY.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS ARE ASSEMBLING OUTSIDE THE HUGE CENTER OF THE JEDI ORDER.

INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
THE JEDI COUNCIL ARE ASSEMBLED AS MACE WINDU MAKES HIS PLEA.

				MACE WINDU
			THE LONGER WE WAIT, THE STRONGER
			DOOKU'S ARMIES BECOME. WE CANNOT
			WAIT FOR THE SENATE TO MAKE UP ITS
			MIND ABOUT GRANTING THE CHANCELLOR
			EMERGENCY POWERS, IN ORDER TO BE
			ABLE TO USE THAT CLONE ARMY... WE
			HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO NOW. WE
			MUST GO NOW.

ALL OF THE JEDI COUNCIL NOD THEIR APPROVAL.

			JEDI SEND. ENOUGH, LET'S HOPE
			THEY ARE.

INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
INSIDE THE GREAT ROTUNDA, THE UPROAR IS EVEN LOUDER. OPPOSING SENATOES YELL FURIOUSLY AT ONE ANOTHER.

				MAS AMEDDA
			ORDER! ORDER!!

FINALLY, THE UPROAR DIES.

				PALPATINE
			IN THE REGRETTABLE ABSENCE OF
			SENATOR AMIDALA, THE CHAIR
			RECOGNISES SENIOR
			REPRESENTATIVE OF NABOO, JAR JAR
			BINKS.

AMID THE CONFLICTING STORM OF CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, WITH TWO GUNGAN AIDES, FLOATS ON HIS POD TO THE MIDDLE OF THE VAST SPACE. HE LOOKS AT PALPATINE NERVOUSLY. PALPATINE NODS. JAR JAR CLEARS HIS THROAT.

				JAR JAR
			SENATORS, DELLOW FELAGATES...

LAUGHTER. JEERS. JAR JAR BLUSHES.

				MAS AMEDDA
			ORDER! THE SENATE WILL ACCORD THE
			REPRESENTATIVE THE COURTESY OF A

COMPARATIVE QUIET. JAR JAR GRIPS THE EDGE OF THE PODIUM.

				JAR JAR
			IN RESPONSE TO THE DIRECT THREAT

			SYSTEMS, I PROPOSE THAT THE SENATE
			GIVES IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY POWERS TO
			THE SUPREME CHANCELLOR.

UPROAR. JAR JAR LOOKS A LITTLE SHEEPISH.

				JAR JAR
				(CONTINUING)
			WHO CAN DENY THESE ARE EXCEPTIONAL
			TIMES? EXCEPTIONAL TIMES DEMAND
			EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES!
			EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES DEMAND
			EXCEPTIONAL MEN!

				ORN FREE TAA
			WE WON'T SUPPORT A DICTATOR.

SHOUTS OF AGREEMENT.

				JAR JAR
			THAT IS THE SENTIMENT EVERY ONE OF
			US AGREES WITH! AND WHEN THE
			SHADOW OF WAR HAS DISPERSED AND
			THE BRIGHT DAY OF LIBERTY HAS
			DAWNED ONCE AGAIN, THE POWER WE NOW
			GIVE TO THE SUPREME CHANCELLOR
			WILL BE GLADLY, AND SWIFTLY
			RETURNED. OUT ANCIENT LIBERTIES
			WILL BE RESTORED TO US, BURNISHED
			EVEN MORE BRIGHTLY THAN BEFORE!

BRIEF SILENCE, THEN A ROLLING WAVE OF APPLAUSE. JAR JAR BEAMS AND BOWS.

PALPATINE RISES.

				PALPATINE
			IT IS WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE THAT
			I HAVE AGREED TO THIS CALLING. I
			LOVE DEMOCRACY... I LOVE THE
			REPUBLIC. THE FACT THAT THIS
			CRISIS IS DEMANDING I BE GIVEN
			ABSOLUTE POWER TO TULE OVER YOU IS
			EVIDENT. BUT I AM MILD BY NATURE
			AND HAVE NO DESIRE TO DESTROY
			THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. THE POWER YOU
			GIVE ME I WILL LAY DOWN WHEN THIS
			CRISIS HAS ABATED, I PROMISE YOU.
			AND ALL I ASK IN RETURN IS WHEN MY
			CURRENT TERM OF OFFICE IS OVER,
			YOU ALLOW ME TO RETURE AND LIVE
			OUT MY LIFE IN PEACE.

				MAS AMEDDA
			WE SHALL PROCEED TO THE VOTE. ALL
			THOSE IN FAVOR OF GRANTING
			EMERGENCY POWERS TO THE SUPREME
			CHANCELLOR, SIGNAL ATE AT THIS
			TIME... THOSE OPPOSED?

EXT. SPACE
THE NABOO STARSHIP HEADS TOWARD THE RINGS OF GEONOSIS.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA
THE NABOO STARSHIP LANDS.

INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER - DAY
ANAKIN SWITCHES OFF THE ENGINES. ARTOO AND THREEPIO ARE IN THE NAVIGATION AREA OF THE COCKPIT. PADME IS IN THE CO-PILOT'S SEAT. SHE GETS UP.

				ANAKIN
			HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

				PADME
			TO FIND OBI-WAN.

ANAKIN GETS UP AND GOES OVER TO HER.

				ANAKIN
			NO! YOU'RE NOT!

HE GRABS HER ARM.

				PADME
			LET GO OF ME!

				ANAKIN
			I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO OUT THERE.
			IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

				PADM�
			WHAT?!?

				ANAKIN
			IT'S MY JOB TO PROTECT YOU. I SAID
			IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. YOU'RE NOT
			GOING, AND THAT'S FINAL!

				PADM�
			DON'T YOU GIVE ME ORDERS, ANNIE!
			I'M A SENATOR OF THE GALACTIC
			REPUBLIC. YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY
			TO CONTAIN ME, RESTRAIN ME, OR
			DIRECT ME! YOU REMEMBER YOUR
			PLACE, YOUNG MAN.
				(STANDING UP)
			NOW YOU CAN COME ALONG AND PROTECT
			ME OR STAY HERE. IT'S UP TO YOU.

PADME STORMS OUT OF THE COCKPIT OF THE NABOO STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN STANDS SCRATCHING HIS HEAD, THEN FOLLOWS.

ARTOO BEEPS AND WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
			YES, IT IS, ARTOO. MOST
			CONFUSING. ONE MOMENT THEY'RE
			GENERATING A PLEASANT MUTUAL
			ATTRACTION AND THE NEXT, WAVES OF
			VIOLENT HOSTILITY. EVEN THOUGH
			I'M PROGRAMMED TO UNDERSTAND THEM,
			I DOUBT IF I EVER SHALL.

ARTOO WHISTLES A PLAINTIVE SIGH.

INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS - DAY
ANAKIN AND PADME ENTER THE STALAGMITE CITY. THEY STOP, LOOKING AROUND IN WONDER AT THE EMPTINESS.

				PADME
				(IN A LOW VOICE)
			IT'S EMPTY!

THEY START FORWARD. AS THEY PASS, THE SURFACE OF THE PILLARS SEEMS TO PULSE SLOWLY AND MOVE. HIGH ABOVE WINGED CREATURES GROW FROM THE PILLARS AND DETACH THEMSELVES.

INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
ANAKIN AND PADME CROSS THE SQUARE, REACHING THE MIDDLE. THEY STOP SUDDENLY AS FOUR GEONOSIANS GRABS THEM. ANAKIN REACHES FOR HIS LIGHTSABER.

				PADME
			WAIT!

TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS CARRYING WEAPONS ALIGHT ON THE FLAGSTONES IN FRONT OF THEM.

THE GEONOSIANS PART, AND COUNT DOOKU APPEARS. HE BOWS COURTEOUSLY.

				COUNT DOOKU
			SENATOR AMIDALA, I'VE HEARD SO
			MUCH ABOUT YOU.

				PADM�
			COUNT DOOKU, I ASSUME.

				COUNT DOOKU
			I'M DELIGHTED TO MEET YOU AT
			LAST. WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO
			DISCUSS, SENATOR. I HOPE YOU CAN
			KEEP YOUR YOUNG JEDI UNDER CONTROL.

				PADM�
			DON'T WORRY HE'S HOUSEBROKEN.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY
COUNT DOOKU SITS AT A LARGE CONFERENCE TABLE WITH PADME ON THE FAR
SIDE. ANAKIN STANDS BEHIND HER WITH FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS STANDING BEHIND HIM. JANGO FETT STANDS BEHIND COUNT DOOKU, AND SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS STAND BEHIND HIM.

				PADM�
			YOU ARE HOLDING A JEDI KNIGHT, OBI-
			WAN KENOBI. I AM FORMALLY
			REQUESTING YOU TURN HIM OVER TO
			ME, NOW.

				DOOKU
			HE HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF
			ESPIONAGE, SENATOR, AND WILL BE
			EXECUTED. IN JUST A FEW HOURS, I
			BELIEVE.

COUNT DOOKU SMILES.

				PADM�
			HE IS AN OFFICER OF THE REPUBLIC.
			YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

				DOOKU
			WE DON'T RECOGNISE THE REPUBLIC
			HERE, SENATOR. BUT IF NABOO WERE
			TO JOIN OUR ALLIANCE, I COULD
			EASILY HEAR YOUR PLEA FOR CLEMENCY.

ANAKIN GRABS HIS LIGHTSABER BUT DOESN'T TURN IT ON.

				PADM�
			AND IF I DON'T JOIN YOUR
			REBELLION, I ASSUME THIS JEDI WITH
			ME WILL ALSO DIE?

				DOOKU
			I DON'T WISH TO MAKE YOU TO JOIN
			OUR CAUSE AGAINST YOUR WILL,
			SENATOR, BUT YOU ARE A RATIONAL,
			HONEST REPRESENTATIVE OF YOUR
			PEOPLE AND I ASSUME YOU WANT TO DO
			WHAT'S IN THEIR BEST INTEREST.
			AREN'T YOU FED UP WITH THE
			CORRUPTION, THE BUREAUCRATS, THE
			HYPOCRISY OF IT ALL?.. AREN'T
			YOU? BE HONEST, SENATOR.

				PADM�
			THE IDEALS ARE STILL ALIVE, COUNT,
			EVEN IF THE INSTITUTION IS FAILING.

				DOOKU
			YOU BELIEVE IN THE SAME IDEALS WE
			BELIEVE IN! THE SAME IDEALS WE
			ARE STRIVING TO MAKE PROMINENT.

				PADM�
			IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE, YOU
			SHOULD STAY IN THE REPUBLIC AND
			HELP CHANCELLOR PALPATINE PUT
			THINGS RIGHT.

				DOOKU
			THE CHANCELLOR MEANS WELL, M'LADY
			BUT HE IS INCOMPETENT. HE HAS
			PROMISED TO CUT THE BUREAUCRACY,
			BUT THE BUREAUCRATS ARE STRONGER
			THAN EVER, NO? SENATOR, THE
			REPUBLIC CANNOT BE FIXED. IT IS
			TIME TO START OVER. THE
			DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE REPUBLIC
			IS A SHAM, A SHELL GAME PLAYED
			ON THE VOTERS. IT WILL NOT BE LONG
			BEFORE THE CULT OF GREED, CALLED
			THE REPUBLIC, WILL LOSE EVEN THE
			PRETEXT OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM.

				PADM�
			I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT. I WILL NOT
			FORSAKE ALL I HAVE HONOURED AND
			WORKED FOR AND BETRAY THE
			REPUBLIC. I KNOW OF YOUR TREATIES
			WITH THE TRADE FEDERATION, THE
			COMMERCE GUILDS, AND THE OTHERS,
			COUNT. WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS
			NOT GOVERNMENT THAT HAS BEEN
			BOUGHT OUT BY BUSINESS... IT'S
			BUSINESS BECOMING GOVERNMENT!

				DOOKU
			ARE YOU WILLING TO BETRAY YOUR JEDI
			FRIENDS? WITHOUT YOUR CO-OPERATION
			I CAN DO NOTHING TO STOP THEIR
			EXECUTION.

				PADM�
			WHAT IS TO HAPPEN TO ME? AM I TO BE
			EXECUTED ALSO?

				DOOKU
			I WOULDN'T THINK OF SUCH AN
			OFFENCE. BUT, THERE ARE
			INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A STRONG
			INTEREST IN YOUR DEMISE, M'LADY.
			IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
			POLITICS, I'M AFRAID. IT'S PURELY
			PERSONAL, AND THEY HAVE ALREADY
			PAID GREAT SUMS TO HAVE YOU
			ASSASSINATED. I'M SURE THEY WILL
			PUSH HARD TO HAVE YOU INCLUDED IN
			THE EXECUTIONS. I'M SORRY BUT IF
			YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CO-OPERATE, I
			MUST TURN YOU OVER TO THE
			GEONOSIANS FOR JUSTICE. I'VE DONE
			ALL I CAN FOR YOU.

JANGO FETT MOVES OVER TO ANAKIN.

				JANGO FETT
			I'LL TAKE THAT WEAPON.

ANAKIN HESITATES.

				DOOKU
			YOU MAY CAUSE A LOT OF BLOODSHED,
			MY YOUNG JEDI, BUT YOU WILL NOT
			ESCAPE.

				PADM�
			ANAKIN...

ANAKIN HANDS HIS LIGHTSABER OVER TO JANGO FETT.

INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY
ANAKIN AND PADME ARE STANDING IN THE CENTRE OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A COURTROOM. SEATED BEFORE THEM IN A TALL, BOXED-OFF AREA IS POGGLE THE LESSER, ARCHDUKE OF GEONOSIS. HE IS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS UNDERLING, SUN RIT. OFF TO ONE SIDE THE SEPARATIST SENATORS PO NUDU, TESSEK, AND TOONBUCK TOORA. NEXT TO THEM ARE THE COMMERCE DIGNITARIES, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR AND SAN HILL OF THE INTERGALACTIC BANK CLAN. ALONG THE WALL ABOUT A HUNDRED GEONOSIANS WAIT FOR A VERDICT.

				SUN RIT
			YOU HAVE BEEN CHARGED AND FOUND
			GUILTY OF ESPIONAGE.

				POGGLE
			DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY BEFORE
			YOUR SENTENCE IS CARRIED OUT?

				PADM�
			YOU ARE COMMITTING AN ACT OF WAR,
			ARCHDUKE. I HOPE YOU ARE PREPARED
			FOR THE CONSEQUENCES.

POGGLE LAUGHS. COUNT DOOKU SIMPLY SMILES.

				POGGLE
			WE BUILD WEAPONS, SENATOR... THAT
			IS OUR BUSINESS! OF COURSE WE'RE
			PREPARED!

				NUTE GUNRAY
			GET ON WITH IT. CARRY OUT THE
			SENTENCE. I WANT TO SEE HER SUFFER.

				POGGLE
			YOUR OTHER JEDI FRIEND IS WAITING
			FOR YOU, SENATOR. TAKE THEM TO
			THE ARENA!

FOUR GUARDS TAKE HOLD OF PADME AND ANAKIN. THEY ARE ESCORTED OUT OF THE CHAMBER TO THE SOUNDS OF CHUCKLING.

INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
IN THE GLOOMY TUNNEL, ANAKIN AND PADME ARE TOSSED INTO AN OPEN CART. THE MURMUR OF A VAST CROWD IS HEARD OFFSCREEN. GUARDS EXTEND THEIR ARMS ALONG THE FRAMEWORK AND TIE THEM SO THAT THEY STAND FACING EACH OTHER.

THE DRIVER GETS UP ONTO HIS SEAT.

				ANAKIN
			DON'T BE AFRAID.

				PADM�
			I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE. I'VE BEEN
			DYING A LITTLE BIT EACH DAY SINCE
			YOU CAME BACK INTO MY LIFE.

				ANAKIN
			WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

				PADM�
			I LOVE YOU.

				ANAKIN
			YOU LOVE ME?! I THOUGHT WE
			DECIDED NOT TO FALL IN LOVE. THAT
			WE WOULD BE FORCED TO LIVE A LIE.
			THAT IT WOULD DESTROY OUR LIVES...

				PADM�
			I THINK OUR LIVES ARE ABOUT TO BE
			DESTROYED ANYWAY. MY LOVE FOR YOU
			IS A PUZZLE, ANNIE, FOR WHICH I
			HAVE NO ANSWERS. I CAN'T CONTROL
			IT... AND NOW I DON'T CARE. I
			TRULY, DEEPLY LOVE YOU, AND BEFORE
			WE DIE I WANT YOU TO KNOW.

PADME LEANS TOWARD ANAKIN. BY STRAINING HARD, IT IS JUST POSSIBLE FOR
THEIR LIPS TO MEET. THEY KISS.

				ANAKIN
			I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE CURED OF
			THIS LOVE EITHER. LONG OR SHORT,
			I VOW TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE
			WITH YOU.

THEY KISS AGAIN.

THE DRIVER CRACKS HIS WHIP OVER THE ORRAY HARNESSED BETWEEN THE SHAFTS. THE CART JERKS FORWARD. SUDDENLY, THERE ISA HUGE ROAR AND BLINDING SUNLIGHT AS THEY EMERGE INTO THE ARENA

INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
THE GREAT STADIUM IS PACKED WITH TIER UPON TIER OF YELLING GEONOSIANS. THE CART TRUNDLES TO THE CENTER, WHERE OBI-WAN IS CHAINED TO ONE OF FOUR UPRIGHT POSTS THATARE THREE FEET IN DIAMETER. THE CART STOPS. PADME AND ANAKIN ARE TAKEN DOWN, DRAGGED TO POSTS, AND CHAINED TO THEM. PADME IS IN THE CENTER.

				OBI-WAN
			I WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER IF YOU
			HAD GOTTEN MY MESSAGE.

				ANAKIN
			I RETRANSMITTED IT AS YOU
			REQUESTED, MASTER. THEN WE DECIDED
			TO COME AND RESCUE YOU.

				OBI-WAN
			IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING A GOOD
			JOB SO FAR.

THEIR ARMS ARE PULLED HIGH ABOVE THEIR HEADS, AND THE CART DRIVES AWAY. THERE IS ANOTHER ROAR AS POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS AND DIGNITARIES ARRIVE IN THE ARCHDUCAL BOX AND TAKE THEIR PLACES.

				SUN RIT
			THE FELONS BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN
			CONVICTED OF ESPIONAGE AGAINST THE
			SOVEREIGN SYSTEM OF GEONOSIS.
			THEIR SENTENCE OF DEATH IS TO BE
			CARRIED OUT IN THIS PUBLIC ARENA
			HENCEFORTH.

THE CROWD ROARS AND CHEERS. IN THE BOX, POGGLE THE LESSER RISES. THE CROWD BECOMES QUIET.

				POGGLE
			LET THE EXECUTIONS BEGIN!

THE CROWD GOES WILD.

				ANAKIN
			I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

FROM DIFFERENT GATES AROUND THE ARENA, THREE MONSTERS ARE DRIVEN IN. ONE IS A REEK (BULL-LIKE), ONE IS A NEXU (LION-LIKE), AND ONE IS AN ACKLAY (A KIND OF DINO-LOBSTER). THEY ARE DRIVEN IN BY PICADORS CARRYING LONG SPEARS AND RIDING ORRAYS. THE PICADORS POKE THE MONSTERS TOWARD THE CENTER, THEN RETIRE TO THE PERIMETER.

THE MONSTERS TOSS THEIR HEADS, LOOKING AROUND, ROARING OR SCREECHING. THEN THEY CATCH SIGHT OF THE THREE CAPTIVES AND START MOVING TOWARD THEM.

				OBI-WAN
			TAKE THE ONE THE LEFT. I'LL
			TAKE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT.

				ANAKIN
			WHAT ABOUT PADME?

PADME HAS TURNED AROUND AND IS PULLING HERSELF UP BY THE CHAIN TO THE TOP OF THE POST. WITHIN A MOMENT, SHE IS STANDING ON TOP OF IT, TRYING TO PULL THE CHAIN FREE.

				OBI-WAN
			IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ALREADY ON TOP
			OF THINGS.

THE REEK CHARGES ANAKIN. HE JUMPS UP, AND THE BEAST HITS THE POST HARD. ANAKIN LANDS ONTO ITS BACK, WRAPPING PART OF HIS CHAIN AROUND ITS HORN. THE REEK BACKS OFF, SHAKING ITS HEAD ANGRILY, WHICH TEARS THE CHAIN FROM THE POST

OBI-WAN DUCKS AROUND THE POST AS THE ACKLAY CHARGES. IT KNOCKS THE POST FLAT, SENDING OBI-WAN SPRAWLING. THE ACKLAY CRUNCHES THE POST BETWEEN ITS CLAWS, FREEING THE CHAIN. OBI-WAN LEAPS UP AND RUNS TOWARDS ONE OF THE PICADORS. THE ACKLAY TAKS OFF AFTER HIM.

THE NEXU ARRIVES AT PADME'S POST AND REARS ON ITS HIND LEGS. ONE TOP, PADME STRUGGLES TO TEAR THE CHAIN FREE. THE NEXU ROARS, DISPLAYING WICKED, DRIPPING FANGS.

IN THE ARCHDUCAL BOX, NUTE GUNRAY BEAMS AND RUBS HIS HANDS.

IN THE ARENA, OBI-WAN RUNS AT THE PICADOR. THE ORRAY REARS UP. OBI-WAN GRABS THE PICADOR'S LONG SPEAR AND POLE VAULTS OVER HIM. THE CHASING ACKLAY SMASHES INTO THE ORRAY. IT GOES DOWN. THE PICADOR TUMBLES ONTO THE SAND, WHERE HE IS GRABBED BY THE ACKLAY AND CRUNCHED.

ANAKIN'S REEK STARTS TO BUCK. IT CHARGES AROUND THE ARENA WITH ANAKIN HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE. HE WHIRLS THE FREE LENGTH OF CHAIN AROUND HIS HEAD AND CASTS IT INTO THE REEK'S MOUTH. ITS JAWS CLAMP HARD ON THE CHAIN. ANAKIN YANKS HARD ON THE CHAIN, TURNING THE REEK, BEGINNING TO RIDE IT.

THE NEXU'S CLAWS DIG DEEP INTO THE POST. THE CAT-LIKE CREATURE REACHES THE TOP OF THE POST AND TAKES A SWIPE AT PADME. SHE TURNS AND THE CLAW BARELY CATCHES HER SHIRT RIPPING IT OFF, LEAVING SUPERFICIAL CLAW MARKS ACROSS HER BACK. SHE HITS THE CREATURE WITH HER CHAIN AND IT BACKS OFF DOWN THE POLE. THEN, PADME JUMPS OFF THE POST INTO THE AIR. SHE SWINGS AROUND ON THE CHAIN AND WHACKS THE BEAST HARD ON THE HEAD WITH BOTH HER FEET. IT TUMBLES BACK ONTO THE SAND.

IN THE ARCHDUCAL BOX:

				NUTE GUNRAY
			FOUL!! SHE CAN'T DO THAT... SHOOT
			HER OR SOMETHING!

IN THE ARENA, OBI-WAN RUNS OUT FROM BEHIND THE FALLEN ORRAY AND THROWS THE SPEAR AT THE ACKLAY, HITTING IT IN THE NECK. IT LETS OUT A TERRIBLE SCREECH AND TURNS ON HIM. THE NEXU SPRINGS UP AND MAKES TO LEAP UP AT PADME AGAIN. SHE FINALLY MANAGES TO WORK THE CHAIN LOOSE. ANAKIN COMES CHARGING UP ON THE REEK.

				ANAKIN
			YOU OKAY?

				PADME
				(NODS, GASPING)
			SURE! WELL, SORT OF.

				ANAKIN
			JUMP!!!

THE NEXU SPRINGS. PADME LEAPS FROM THE TOP OF THE POST TO LAND ON THE REEK IN FRONT OF ANAKIN. HE HAULS HER UPRIGHT. THE REEK CHARGES AWAY, AROUND THE ARENA. THE NEXU BOUNDS AFTER IT. THE REEK PASSES THE WOUNDED ACKLAY. THE NEXU SMELLS THE BLOOD AND TURNS ASIDE TO ATTACK THE ACKLAY. THE TWO MONSTERS FIGHT. THE CROWD GROANS AND BOOS.

IN THE ARCHDUCAL BOX, NUTE GUNRAY TURNS ANGRILY TO COUNT DOOKU.

				NUTE GUNRAY
			THIS ISN'T HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO
			BE! JANGO, FINISH HER OFF.

COUNT DOOKU MOTIONS FOR THE BOUNTY HUNTER TO PTAY PUT. BOBA FETT IS ENJOYING THE SPECTACLE.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(SMILING ENIGMATICALLY)
			PATIECE, VICEROY... SHE WILL DIE.
			MAYBE THIS IS THE WAY IT'S
			SUPPOSED TO END.

OBI-WAN RUNS AND JUMPS ON THE BACK OF THE REEK BEHIND ANAKIN. ACROSS THE ARENA, THE NEXU, HAVING CHEWED UP THE ACKLAY, STARTS TO ADVANCE TOWARD THEM.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
ARTOO BEEPS

				C-3PO
			YES, IT HAS BEEN RATHER A LONG
			TIME. DO YOU SUPPOSE SOMETHING'S
			HAPPENED TO THEM?

ARTOO BEEPS AND WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
				(CONTINUING)
			DANGER? OH NO, I SHOULDN'T THINK
			SO. IT LOOKS A VERY DULL PLANET
			TO ME. THEY SHOULD BE BACK
			SHORTLY. JUST STOP WORRYING, ARTOO.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
IN THE ARCHDUCAL BOX, AMID THE UPROAR, COUNT DOOKU FEELS A TAP ON HIS SHOULDER. HE TURNS TO SEE MACE WINDU STANDING BEHIND HIM. COUNT DOOKU MASKS HIS SURPRISE ELEGANTLY AS HE SURVEYS THE ARENA AND SEES JEDI KNIGHTS STANDING AT EVERY ENTRANCE AND EXIT.

				COUNT DOOKU
			MASTER WINDU, HOW PLEASANT OF YOU
			TO JOIN US. YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
			FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH. I WOULD
			THINK THESE TWO NEW BOYS OF YOURS
			COULD USE A LITTLE MORE TRAINING.

				MACE WINDU
			SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU, DOOKU.
			THIS PARTY'S OVER.

MACE WINDU SIGNALS, AND AT STATEGIC PLACES AROUND THE ARENA THERE ARE SUDDEN FLASHES OF LIGHT AS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED JEDI SWITCH ON THEIR LIGHTSABERS. THE CROWD IS SUDDENLY SILENT. COUNT DOOKU'S LIPS CURL IN SLIGHT AMUSEMENT.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(TO MACE WINDU)
			BRAVE, BUT STUPID, MY OLD JEDI
			FRIEND. YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLY
			OUTNUMBERED.

				MACE WINDU
			I DON'T THINK SO. ONE JEDI HAS TO
			BE WORTH A HUNDRED GEONOSIANS.

COUNT DOOKU LOOKS AROUND THE GREAT THEATER. HIS SMILE GROWS.

				COUNT DOOKU
			IT WASN'T THE GEONOSIANS I WAS
			THINKING ABOUT. HOW WELL DO YOU
			THINK ONE JEDI WILL HOLD UP
			AGAINST A THOUSAND BATTLE DROIDS?

COUNT DOOKU SIGNALS. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS START TO POUR INTO ALL PARTS OF THE ARENA.

MACE WINDU DRAWS HIS LIGHTSABER, JANGO FETT DRAWS HIS GUNS AND FIRES AT MACE WINDU, WHO DEFLECTS THE SHOTS. JANGO FETT AND MACE WINDU JUMP INTO THE ARENA, WHERE THEY FIGHT. BOBA FETT WACTHES HIS DAD AND THE JEDI MASTER FIGHT. THE BATTLE BEGINSS. GEONOSIANS FLY AWAY EVERYWHERE. DROIDS FIRE AT JEDI, WHO DEFLECT THE BOLTS AND CULT DOWN THE DROIDS. THE GEONOSIAN TROOPS FIRE RAY GUNS THAT ARE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE JEDI TO DEFLECT.

THE REEK AND THE NEXU ARE SPOOKED BY THE BATTLE. THE REEK BUCKS THE RIDERS OFF ITS BACK AND STAMPEDES AROUND THE ARENA, TRAMPLING DROIDS AND JEDI THAT HAVE MOVED INTO ITS PATH. PADME PICKS UP A DISCARDED PISTOL AND JOINS THE FIGHT. SEVERAL JEDI RUN TO THE CENTER OF THE ARENA AND TOSS LIGHTSABERS TO OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN.

AMONG THE CROWD, JEDI CUT DOWN SWATHS OF GEONOSIANS AND DROIDS. ON THE SAND, JEDI FIGHT, ATTACKING DROIDS. OBI0WAN AND ANAKIN SWING THEIR LIGHTSABERS, CUTTING DROIDS IN HALF. PADME BLASTS AWAY AT DROIDS AND GEONOSIANS.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP
ARTOO WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
			I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
				(ARTOO BEEPS)
			YOU'RE SCARING ME! STOP IMAGINING
			THINGS!

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
AMONG THE TIERS, JEDI ARE SLOWLY BEING DRIVEN BACK. THEY HAVE KILLED HEAPS OF GEONOSIANS AND HAVE KNCOKED OUT PILES OF DROIDS, BUT SHEER NUMBERS ARE TELLING. INDIVIDUAL JEDI ARE BEING CUT DOWN OR BLASTED/ THE REST ARE RETREATING INTO THE ARENA.

ANAKIN AND PADME ARE BACK-TO-BACK, FIGHTING DROIDS AND FLYING GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU FIGHTS FIERCELY WITH JANGO FETT. FINALLY, THE BOUNTY HUNTER FALLS. HIS HELMET GOES FLYING, BOUNCING DOWN THE STEPS, TUMBLING AND ROLLING, KICKED HERE AND THERE BY RANDOM FEET. THE BOUNTY HUNTER'S BODY FALLS TO THE GROUND.

MACE WINDU RUNS TO THE CENTER OF THE ARENA AND FIGHTS BACK-TO-BACK WITH OBI-WAN, AS THEY SWIPE AND MANGLE DROIDS.

				OBI-WAN
			SOMEONE'S GOT TO - SHUT DOWN -
			THESE DROIDS.

				MACE WINDU
			DON'T WORRY! IT'S BEING - TAKEN
			CARE OF!

EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI LEADS A RAIDING PARTY OF ABOUT TWENTY JEDI THROUGH THE LINES OF PARKED BATTLE STARSHIPS. THEY CUT A SWATH THROUGH MASSES OF DROIDS UNTIL THEY ARRIVE AT THE COMMAND STARSHIP. SOME JEDI FALL. THE REST CUT THEIR WAY UP THE RAMPS AND INTO THE COMMAND SHIP.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI AND TEH SURVIVING JEDI FIGHT THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CORRIDORS OF THE COMMAND SHIP, DEFLECTING LASER BOLTS, SLICING DROIDS.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY
THEY BURST ONTO THE BRIDGE AND CHOP DOWN THE COMMAND DROIDS. THE NEIMOIDIANS FLEE IN ALL DIRECTIONS. KE-ADI-MUNDI LEANS OVER THE CONTROL PANEL. HE LOCATES THE ILLUMINATED MASTER SWITCH AND PUNCHES DOWN ON IT. IT GOES DARK. INSTANTLY, ALL THE DROIDS ON THE STARSHIP AND ALL THE DROIDS IN THE ARENA FREEZE!

THERE IS A MOMENT OF STUNNED SILENCE, THEN THE JEDI CHEER. ONE THE BRIDGE, PLO KOON CLAPS KI-ADI-MUNDI ON THE BACK.

				PLO KOON
			WE'VE DONE IT! NOW WE HAVE A
			CHANCE!

SUDDENLY, THERE IS A HARSH BEEPING SOUND. ALL THE DROIDS ON THE STARSHIP AND ALL THE DROIDS IN THE ARENA START FIGHTING AGAIN! KI-ADI-MUNDI STARES IN DISBELIEF AND DISMAY.

				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			THE SYSTEM'S OFF BUT THEY'RE STILL
			ACTIVE. THAT'S A NEW FEATURE. THEY
			ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE CONTROL
			SYSTEM.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME AND AN EXHAUSTED GROUP OF ABOUT TWENTY JEDI STAND IN THE CENTER OF THE ARENA SURROUNDED BY A RING OF BATTLE DROIDS. THE BLOODIED SAND AROUND THEM IS STREWN WITH THE BODIES OF DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS AND JEDI.

AT THE FOOT OF SOME STEPS, BOBA FETT FINDS HIS FATHER'S BATTERED HELMET. HE PICKS IT UP.

KI-ADI-MUNDI AND THE SURVIVORS FROM THE RAIDING PARTY ARE HERDED INTO THE ARENA BY SUPERDROIDS. FROM THE ENCIRCLING TIERS ABOVE, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS LEVEL THEIR WEAPONS MENACINGLY.

IN THE ARCHDUCAL BOX, COUNT DOOKU LIFTS HIS HAND. THE DROIDS LOWER THEIR WEAPONS. THE COUNT CALLS OUT TO THE JEDI.

				COUNT DOOKU
			MASTER WINDU!

SILENCE.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(CONTINUING)
			YOU HAVE FOUGHT GALLANTLY. WORTHY
			OF RECOGNITION IN THE HISTORY
			ARCHIVES OF THE JEDI ORDER. NOW
			IT IS FINISHED.
				(PAUSES BRIEFLY)
			SURRENDER - AND YOUR LIVES WILL BE
			SPARED.

				MACE WINDU
			WE WILL NOT BE HOSTAGES FOR YOU TO
			BARTER WITH DOOKU.

				COUNT DOOKU
			THEN, I'M SORRY, OLD FRIEND. YOU
			WILL HAVE TO BE DESTROYED.

THE DROIDS RAISE THEIR WEAPONS. ANAKIN AND PADME CLASPS HANDS TIGHTLY. COUNT DOOKU RAISES HIS HAND TO GIVE THE ORDER TO FIRE. PADME LOOKS UP SUDDENLT AND WHISPERS TO ANAKIN.

				PADME
			LOOK!

ABOVE, SIX GUNSHIPS ARE DESCENDING FAST THROUGH THE OPEN AREA IN THE ARENA CEILING. THEY LAND IN A CLUSTER AROUND THE HANDFUL OF JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS SPILL OUT AND START FIRING AT THE DROIDS. THERE IS A HELLSTORM OF LASERFIRE THAT BOUNCES OFF THE LASER SHIELDS CREATED BY THE GUNSHIPS. YODA APPEARS AT THE DOOR OF ONE OF THE GUNSHIPS.

				YODA
			COME ON - HURRY! HURRY!

THE SURVIVING JEDI DASH TO THE GUNSHIPS AND SCRAMBLE IN. MACE WINDU HANGS ON TIGHT AS THE GUNSHIP, FIRING ALL ITS WEAPONS, RISES OUT OF THE ARENA UP AND OVER THE TOPMOST RIM.

EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
THE MASSED LINES OF PARKED FEDERATION STARSHIPS AND THE DROIDS SURROUNDING THE ARENA, ARE THEMSELVES SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF REPUBLIC STARSHIPS, DISGORGING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. BEYOND, MORE REPUBLIC STARSHIPS ARE LANDING AND SPEWING OUT TROOPS.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY
MACE WINDU STARES AT THE INCREDIBLE SIGHT.

				YODA
			MORE BATTALIONS TO THE LEFT.
			ENCIRCLE THEM WE MUST, THEN
			DIVIDE.

THE CLONE TROOPERS OPEN FIRE WITH ARTILLERY. EXPLOSIONS WRECK THE PARKED BATTLE STARSHIPS. CLONE TROOPERS ADVANCE, FIRING AT THE MASSED DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS FLY OVERHEAD, EXCHANGING FIRE WITH THE GUNSHIPS AND JEDI FIGHTERS.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
THREEPIO AND ARTOO SEE FLASHES OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP, EXPLODING EVERYWHERE.

				C-3PO
			I'M SURE I HEARD SOMETHING, THIS
			TIME. DIDN'T YOU? IT'S PROBABLY
			JUST A CELEBRATION

ARTOO LETS OUT AN EXHAUSTED BLEEP.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY
GUNSHIP #2 SKIMS THE BATTLEFIELD, FIRING DOWN, DEFLECTING ANSWERING FIRE FROM THE DROIDS.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN AND PADME ARE AT THE OPEN SIDES OF THE GUNSHIP. CLONES FIRE DOWN AT THE DROIDS BELOW.

THE GUNSHIP SLOWS, CIRCLING OVER A DROID GUN-EMPLACEMENT. IT BLASTS IT, BUT SUDDENLY THE GUNSHIP IS ROCKED BY A NEAR MISS. IT LURCHES VIOLENTLY.

				OBI-WAN
			HOLD ON! LOOK OVER THERE...

THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GUNSHIP, THEY SEE A GEONOSIAN SPEEDER RACING PAST. IN THE OPEN COCKPIT IS THE UNMISTAKABLE FIGURE OF COUNT DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			IT'S DOOKU, GO AFTER HIM!

THE PILOT STARTS TO COMPLY, BUT... THERE IS A HUGE BLASTS, THE SHIP LURCHES ON ITS SIDE, AND PADME TUMBLES OUT.

				ANAKIN
				(CONTINUING)
			PADME!!!

ANAKIN STARES DOWN IN HORROR AS PADME HITS THR GROUND BELOW.

				ANAKIN
				(CONTINUING; TO PILOT)
			PUT THE SHIP DOWN! DOWN!

				OBI-WAN
			NO! FORGET HER. WE HAVE TO GO
			AFTER DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			NO WE'RE NOT!! LAND THIS SHIP!

				OBI-WAN
			DON'T LET YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS
			GET IN THE WAY. WE'VE GOT A JOB TO
			DO.

BELOW, PADME HAULS HERSELF TO HER FEET AND WAVES FOR THEM TO GO AFTER DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			I DON'T CARE!.. GO BACK.

				OBI-WAN
			ANAKIN! SHE'S ALL RIGHT! LOOK.

ANAKIN STARES OUT TO SEE PADME RESCUED BY CLONE TROOPERS.

				OBI-WAN
				(CONTINUING)
			FOLLOW THAT SPEEDER!

ON THE GROUND, PADME LOOKS UP AT GUNSHIP #2 AS IT SPEEDS AWAY AFTER COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN FOLLOW THE SPEEDER TO A GEONOSIAN TOWER. THE SPEEDER DECSENDS RAPIDLY; THE GUNSHIP FOLLOWS.

COUNT DOOKU'S SPEEDER PARKS OUTSIDE THE TOWER; THE GUNSHIP PARKS NEXT TO IT. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN LEAP DOWN AND RUN INSIDE THE TOWER.

INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY
COUNT DOOKU THROWS SWITCHES ON A CONTROL PANEL. HIS INTERSTELLAR SAIL SHIP IS GUARDED BY A SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. THE DOORS OF THE EXIT-PORT SLIDE OPEN.

				DROID CAPTAIN
			YOUR EXCELLENCY!

COUNT DOOKU TURNS AS OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN RUN IN THROUGH THE HANGER DOORS. THEY DRAW THEIR LIGHTSABERS. THE DROIDS RAISE THEIR WEAPONS.

				COUNT DOOKU
			THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY, CAPTAIN.
			STAND DOWN. AND LEAVE THEM TO ME.

THE DROIDS LOWER THEIR WEAPONS AND BACK OFF TO THE WALLS. COUNT DOOKU LOOKS AT OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN WITH SLIGHT AMUSEMENT.

				OBI-WAN
				(TO ANAKIN)
			WE MOVE IN TOGETHER - YOU SLOWLY
			ON THE...

				ANAKIN
			I'M TAKING HIM NOW!

				OBI-WAN
			ANAKIN, NO!

				ANAKIN
			YOU'LL PAY FOR ALL THE JEDI YOU'VE
			KILLED TODAY, DOOKU.

ANAKIN CHARGES ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE AT COUNT DOOKU, WHO SMILES FAINTLY, WATCHING HIM COME. ANAKIN RAISES HIS LIGHTSABER. AT THE LAST MOMENT, COUNT DOOKU THRUSTS OUT AN ARM, AND ANAKIN IS LIFTED UP, HURLED ACROSS THE ROOM, AND SLAMMED INTO THE OPPOSITE WALL. HE SLUMPS TO THE FOOT OF THE WALL, SEMI-CONSCIOUS. COUNT DOOKU MOVES TOWARD OBI-WAN

				COUNT DOOKU
			KENOBI, ISN'T IT? AS YOU CAN SEE,
			MY JEDI POWERS ARE FAR BEYOND
			YOURS. NOW, BACK DOWN.

				OBI-WAN
			I DON'T THINK SO.

OBI-WAN LIFTS HIS LIGHTSABER. COUNT DOOKU SMILES.

				COUNT DOOKU
			AH, BUT IF I MUST.

COUNT DOOKU DRAWS HIS LIGHTSABER. HE AND OBI-WAN START TO CIRCLE EACH OTHER.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(CONTINUING)
			I HAVE SPENT THE LAST TEN YEARS
			LEARNING TO USE THE POWER OF THE
			DARK SIDE. IT GIVES ME INFINITELY
			GREATER POWER.

				OBI-WAN
			YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVE IT.

OBI-WAN COMES IN FAST, SWINGING AT COUNT DOOKU'S HEAD. DOOKU PARRIES THE CUT EASILY. AS THEY FIGHT, IT QUICKLY BECOMES CLEAR THAT DOOKU IS THE COMPLETE SWORDSMAN - ELEGANT, GRACEFUL, CLASSICAL - A MASTER OF THE OLD STYLE.

				COUNT DOOKU
			GRAND MASTER KENOBI, YOU
			DISAPPOINT ME. YODA HOLDS YOU IN
			SUCH HIGH ESTEEM.

COUNT DOOKU PARRIED ANOTHER CUT.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(CONTINUING)
			SURELY YOU CAN DO BETTER...?
				(PARRIES)
			NO, I'M SURPRISED. HAS JEDI
			SWORDSMANSHIP DEGENERATED SO
			QUICKLY, OR ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE
			FUN OF ME?
				(CUTS)
			WHICH IS IT?

COUNT DOOKU THRUSTS. OBI-WAN STEPS BACK QUICKLY, PANTING FOR BREATH.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(CONTINUING)
			COME, COME, MASTER KENOBI. PUT ME
			OUT OF MY MISERY.

OBI-WAN TAKES A DEEP BREATH, GETS A FRESH GRIP ON HIS LIGHTSABER AND COMES IN AGAIN. FOR A MOMENT, HE DRIVES COUNT DOOKU BACK. THEN DOOKU'S SUPERIOR SKILL BEGINS TO TELL AGAIN, AND HE FORCES OBI-WAN TO RETREAT.

COUNT DOOKU INCREASES THE TEMPO OF HIS ATTACK. OBI-WAN IS PUSHED TO THE LIMIT TO DEFEND HIMSELF. DOOKU PRESSES. HIS LIGHTSABER FLASHES.

OBI-WAN IS WOUNDED IN THE SHOULDER, THEN THE THIGH. HE STUMBLES BACK AGAINST THE WALL, TRIPS, AND FALLS. HIS LIGHTSABER GOES SKITTERING ACROSS THE FLOOR.

COUNT DOOKU RAISES HIS LIGHTSABER. OBI-WAN LOOKS UP HELPLESSLY. DOOKU'S LIGHTSABER FLASHES DOWN AND CLASHES AGAINST - ANAKIN'S LIGHTSABER! COUNT DOOKU AND ANAKIN STARE EYEBALL TO EYEBALL.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(CONTINUING)
			THAT'S BRAVE OF YOU, BOY - BUT
			FOOLISH. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
			YOU'D HAVE LEARNT YOUR LESSON.

				ANAKIN
			I'M A SLOW LEARNER.

AND ANAKIN CHARGES AT COUNT DOOKU. THE FORCE OF HIS ATTACK CATCHES THE COUNT SLIGHTLY OFF BALANCE. ANAKIN'S LIGHTSABER FLASHES. COUNT DOOKU DRAWS BACK, PUTTING A HAND TO HIS ARM. HE TAKES THE HAND AWAY AND LOOKS AT THE SMEAR OF BLOOD WHEE ANAKIN HAS NICKED HIM.

				COUNT DOOKU
			YOU HAVE UNUSUAL POWERS, YOUNG
			PADAWAN. BUT NOT ENOUGHT TO SAVE
			YOU THIS TIME.

				ANAKIN
			DON'T BET ON IT!

				OBI-WAN
			ANAKIN!

OBI-WAN USES THE FORCE TO CATCH HIS LIGHTSABER AND HE TOSSES IT TO ANAKIN. WITH TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN ATTACKS. COUNT DOOKU PARRIES AND RIPOSTES. IT IS NO CONTEST. ANAKIN IS DRIVEN BACK AGAINST THE WALL. HE LOSES ONE LIGHTSABER. FINALLY COUNT DOOKU, IN ONE FLASHING MOVE, SENDS ANAKIN'S ARM, CUT AT THE ELBOW, FLYING STILL GRIPPING HIS LIGHTSABER. ANAKIN DROPS TO THE GROUND IN AGONY. COUNT DOOKU DRAWS HIMSELF UP TO DELIVER THE COUP DE GRACE.

SUDDENLY, THE GREAT DOORS SLIDE OPEN. THE DROIDS TURN FAST, RAISING THEIR WEAPONS. THROUGH THE THICK SMOKE, EMERGES THE HEROIC FIGURE OF YODA. HE STOPS ON THE SMOKE-FILLED THREASHOLD, FOUR DROIDS LINED UP ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM, GUNS POINTED.

BEFORE THE DROIDS CAN GET OFF A SHOT, YODA RAISES HIS HAND, AND THE DROIDS ARE FLUNG AGAINST THE FAR WALLS AND CRASH TO THE FLOOR IN HEAPS OF SMOKING METAL.

SILENCE. COUNT DOOKU STEPS AWAY FROM ANAKIN TO FACE THE JEDI GRAND MASTER. HIS LIGHTSABER WHIRLS IN A FORMAL SALUTE.

				COUNT DOOKU
			MASTER YODA. AT LAST WE SHALL
			KNOW WHO IS THE MOST POWERFUL.

YODA DRAWS A MINIATURE LIGHTSABER OUT OF HIS CANE. HE SALUTES FORMALLY.

				YODA
			COUNT DOOKU. NO INTEREST IN
			CONTESTS, DO I HAVE.

COUNT DOOKU CHARGES ACROSS THE SPACE AT YODA. HE RAINS DOWN BLOWS UPON THE TINY FIGURE. YODA DOESN'T BUDGE AN INCH. FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE CONTEST, HE PARRIES EVERY CUT AND THRUST THAT DOOKU AIMS. NOTHING THE GREAT SWORDSMAN TRIES GETS THROUGH. HIS ENERGY DRAINS. HIS STROKES BECOME FEEBLER, SLOWER.

YODA ATTACKS! HE FLIES FORWARD. COUNT DOOKU IS FORCED TO RETREAT. WPRDS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO DESCRIBE THE RANGE AND SKILL OF YODA'S SPEED AND SWORDPLAY. HIS LIGHTSABER HIS A HUMMING BLUR OF LIGHT.

COUNT DOOKU'S LIGHTSABER IS SENT CARTWHEELING FROM HIS HAND. HE STAGGERS BACK, GASPING AND SPENT, AGAINST THE CONTROL PANEL. YODA JUMPS ONTO DOOKU'S SHOULDERS, AND IS ABOUT TO DRIVE THE LIGHTSABER INTO THE TOP OF THE COUNT'S HEAD.

				YODA
				(CONTINUING)
			THE END FOR YOU, COUNT, THIS IS.

				COUNT DOOKU
			...NOT YET...

COUNT DOOKU RAISES HIS ARMS AND KNOCKS YODA OFF HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN, WITH ALL HIS MIGHT, HE USES THE FORCE TO PULL ON ONE OF THE CRANES IN THE HANGER. IT COMES CRASHING DOWN ON OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN. BUT IN THE BLINK OF AND EYE, YODA IS UNDER THE CRANE, HOLDING IT UP, USING THE FORCE. YODA CLOSES HIS EYES AND CONCENTRATES.

ANAKIN IS UNCONSCIOUS, AND OBI0WAN TRIES TOGET OUT FROM UNDER THE CRANE. THE FALLEN CRANE TREMBLES AND STARTS TO LIFE. BEHIND IT, THE SOUND OF THE SAIL SHIP'S ENGINES ARE HEARD STARTING UP.

YODA CONCENTRATES HARDER. SLOWLY, THE CRANE RISES. THE SOUND OF THE ENGINES INCREASES. YODA EXERTS EVERY SCRAP OF HIS POWERS. THE CRANE LIFTS CLEAR OF ANAKIN AND IS THROWN TO THE GROUND. DOOKU'S SAIL SHIP TAKES OFF. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN STRUGGLE TO THE EXHAUSTED YODA, BUT IT'S TOO LATE. THE SAIL SHIP RISES INTO THE AIR AND FLIES AWAY. PADM� AND A CLONE CAPTAIN WITH ABOUT TEN TROOPERS APPEAR IN THE DOORWAY.

				PADM�
			ANAKIN!

PADM� RUNS TOO HIM AND THROWS HER ARMS AROUND HIM. ANAKIN IS BARELY ABLE TO STAND UP. THE CLONE CAPTAIN MARCHES UP TO YODA, STOPS, AND SALUTES SMARTLY.

				CLONE CAPTAIN
			RESISTANCE IS AT AN END, GENERAL.
			WHAT ARE YOUR ORDERS ?

YODA LOOKS AT HIM AND SIGHS.

EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN
COUNT DOOKU'S INTERSTELLAR SAIL SHIP GLIDES THROUGH A DESERTED, BURNED-OUT PART OF CORUSCANT. COUNT DOOKU MANOEUVRES THE SHIP INTO ONE OF THE EMPTY BUILDINGS AND LANDS.

INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
THE RAMP LOWERS. COUNT DOOKU EMERGES AND WALKS TO WHERE THE HOODED FIGURE OF DARTH SIDIOUS STANDS WAITING. COUNT DOOKU BOWS.

				COUNT DOOKU
			THE FORCE IS WITH US, MY MASTER.

				DARTH SIDIOUS
			WELCOME HOME, LORD TYRANUS. YOU HAVE
			DONE WELL.

				COUNT DOOKU
			I BRING YOU GOOD NEWS, MY LORD.
			THE WAR HAS BEGUN.

				DARTH SIDIOUS
			EXCELLENT.
			 	(SMILING)
			EVERYTHING IS GOING AS PLANNED.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - SUNSET
THE BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE BASKS IN THE RED GLOW OF THE SETTING SUN.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - SUNSET

				MACE WINDU
			WHERE IS YOUR APPRENTICE?

				OBI-WAN
			ON HIS WAY BACK TO NABOO. HE IS
			ESCORTING SENATOR AMIDALA HOME.

THEY ARE STANDING, LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE TALL WINDOWS AT THE GREAT PLAZA BELOW. YODA SITS IN HIS CHAIR.

				OBI-WAN
				(CONTINUING)
			I MUST ADMIT WITHOUT THE CLONES,
			IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A VICTORY.

				YODA
			VICTORY? VICTORY, YOU SAY?

OBI-WAN TURNS AND LOOKS AT THE SAD LITTLE JEDI SITTING IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBER. APART FROM KI-ADI-MUNDI AND PLO KOON, WHO IS WOUNDED, THE CHAMBER IS EMPTY.

				YODA
				(CONTINUING)
			NOT VICTORY, A DEFEAT, IT WAS...
			MASTER OBI-WAN. BEGUN, THE CLONE
			WAR HAS!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY
IN A ROSE-COVERED ARBOR OVERLOOKING THE SPARKLING LATE, ANAKIN AND PADME STAND BEFORE A NABOO HOLY MAN.

THREEPIO AND ARTOO STAND BY, WATCHING, AS THE HOLY MAN BLESSES THE HAPPY COUPLE AND, AMID GENTLY FALLING ROSE PETALS, ANAKIN AND PADME KISS.

EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY
PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA AND THE OTHER SENATORS, WITH TWO ROYAL GUARDS, STAND LOOKING DOWN AT THE SQUARE BELOW.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS ARE DRAWN UP IN A STRICT FORMATION OR MOVE FORWARDS IN NEAR FILES TO CLIMB THE RAMPS OF THE MILITARY ASSAULT SHIPS.

ON THE BALCONY, PALPATINE'S EXPRESSION IS DEEPLY SAD. EVERYONE WATCHES COMBERLY AS, IN THE SQUARE, LOADED ASSAULT SHIPS TAKE OFF. OTHER LAND IMMEDIATELY IN THEIR PLACE. THE SKY ABOVE IS THICK WITH TRANSPORTS. CLONE TROOPS MARCH AND BOARD THE SHIPS.

THE GREAT CLONE WAR HAS BEGUN...

FADE OUT:

THE END

STAR WARS EPISODE 3: REVENGE OF THE SITH SCRIPT

GEORGE LUCAS


1 EXT. SPACE

A LONG TIME AGO IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY.

A VAST SEA OF STARS SERVES AS THE BACKDROP FOR THE MAIN TITLE, FOLLOWED BY A ROLLUP, WHICH CRAWLS INTO INFINITY.

WAR! THE REPUBLIC IS CRUMBLING UNDER ATTACKS BY THE RUTHLESS SITH LORD, COUNT DOOKU. THERE ARE HEROES ON BOTH SIDES. EVIL IS EVERYWHERE.

IN A STUNNING MOVE, THE FIENDISH DROID LEADER, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, HAS SWEPT INTO THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL AND KIDNAPPED CHANCELLOR PALPATINE, LEADER OF THE GALACTIC SENATE.

AS THE SEPARATIST DROID ARMY ATTEMPTS TO FLEE THE BESIEGED CAPITAL WITH THEIR VALUABLE HOSTAGE, TWO JEDI KNIGHTS LEAD A DESPERATE MISSION TO RESCUE THE CAPTIVE CHANCELLOR. . . .

PAN DOWN TO REVEAL A REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. CONTINUE TO PAN WITH THE CRUISER AS TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS ENTER AND HEAD TOWARD AN ENEMY BATTLE CRUISER. TRUCK WITH THE JEDI FIGHTERS AS THEY MANEUVER IN UNISON, DODGING FLACK AND ENEMY LASER FIRE. R2-D2 IS ON ANAKIN'S SHIP. R4-P17 IS ON OBI-WAN'S SHIP. A GIANT SPACE BATTLE IS REVEALED AS THE TINY JEDI SHIPS CONTINUE THEIR ASSAULT IN A SYNCHRONOUS BALLET.

2 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN BOUNCES THROUGH THE FLACK WITH A FROWN. HIS SHIP ROCKS VIOLENTLY.

3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN SMILES AS HE BLASTS A TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.

ANAKIN: THERE ISN'T A DROID MADE THAT CAN OUT FLY YOU, MASTER, AND NO OTHER WAY TO GET TO THE CHANCELLOR . . .

OBI-WAN: LOOK OUT, FOUR DROIDS INBOUND . . .

4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE

THE TWO JEDI FIGHTERS SWERVE IN UNISON AS FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS ATTACK. AFTER SEVERAL CLEVER MOVES BY THE JEDI, TWO OF THE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS COLLIDE WITH EACH OTHER IN A BALL OF FLAME.

5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF HIS SHIP.

OBI-WAN: WE'VE GOT TO SPLIT THEM UP.

ANAKIN: BREAK LEFT, FLY THROUGH THE GUNS ON THAT TOWER.

OBI-WAN FLIES TO THE LEFT OF A HUGE TOWER ON A REPUBLIC CRUISER. THE TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS FOLLOW.

OBI-WAN: EASY FOR YOU TO SAY . . . WHY AM I ALWAYS THE BAIT?

ANAKIN: DON'T WORRY. I'M COMING AROUND BEHIND YOU.

OBI-WAN DEFTLY MANEUVERS AROUND A LARGE STARSHIP'S SUPERSTRUCTURE, BUT THE TWO DROID FIGHTERS STAY ON HIS TAIL, BLASTING HIM WITH INTENSE LASER FIRE.

OBI-WAN: ANAKIN, THEY'RE ALL OVER ME!

ANAKIN: DEAD AHEAD! CLOSING . . . LOCK ONTO HIM, ARTOO . . .

ARTOO BEEPS HIS REPLY AS ANAKIN SWOOPS IN FOR THE KILL. ANAKIN BLASTS ONE OF THE DROID DROP FIGHTERS. IT EXPLODES.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING, LAUGHS) WE GOT HIM, ARTOO!

ANAKIN BLASTS AWAY AT THE SECOND DROID DROP FIGHTER AS ARTOO BEEPS AN ANGRY WARNING.

ANAKIN: I COPY, ARTOO.

OBI-WAN: I'M GOING DOWN ON THE DECK.

ANAKIN: GOOD IDEA ... I NEED SOME ROOM TO MANEUVER.

OBI-WAN DIVES TOWARD THE SURFACE OF ONE OF THE LARGER TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS AND IS FORCED TO FLY THROUGH A MAELSTROM OF LASER FLACK. HE SKIMS THE SURFACE, FOLLOWED BY THE DROID DROP FIGHTER, WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) CUT RIGHT. DO YOU HEAR ME?! CUT RIGHT. DON'T LET HIM GET A HANDLE ON YOU. COME ON, ARTOO, LOCK ON! LOCK ON!

ARTOO BEEPS. THE CROSSHAIRS MERGE ON THE DROID DROP FIGHTER.

OBI-WAN: HURRY UP! I DON'T LIKE THIS!

OBI-WAN FLIES THROUGH A NARROW GAP BETWEEN TWO TOWERS ON A BATTLESHIP. THE DROID DROP FIGHTER HITS ONE OF OBI-WAN'S WINGS WITH A LASER BLAST, AND PARTS OF THE SHIP GO FLYING AROUND OBI-WAN'S ASTRO DROID, ARFOUR.

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) OUCH!

R-4 BEEPS A BLUE STREAK.

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) DON'T EVEN TRY TO FIX IT, ARFOUR. I'VE SHUT IT DOWN.

ANAKIN: WE'RE LOCKED ON ... WE'VE GOT HIM . . .

ANAKIN DROPS IN BEHIND THE DROID DROP FIGHTER AND BLOWS HIM APART. ARTOO SQUEALS WITH DELIGHT.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) YEAH! WE GOT HIM . . . GOOD GOING, ARTOO.

OBI-WAN: NEXT TIME YOU'RE THE BAIT . . . NOW LET'S FIND THE COMMAND SHIP AND GET ON WITH IT ...

R-4 BEEPS A BLUE STREAK.

ANAKIN: LOCK ONTO THEM, ARTOO. MASTER, GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S SHIP IS DIRECTLY AHEAD.

ARTOO BEEPS A REPLY, AND IT READS OUT IN ANAKIN'S COCKPIT.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) THE ONE CRAWLING WITH VULTURE DROIDS.

6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN: I SEE IT. OH, THIS IS GOING TO BE EASY.

AHEAD IS A TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER WITH BATLIKE DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS STALKING AROUND ON THE HULL. THE VULTURE FIGHTERS TRANSFORM INTO FLIGHT CONFIGURATION, LIFT OFF THE CRUISER, AND ATTACK THE JEDI STARFIGHTERS.

ANAKIN: COME ON, MASTER.

OBI-WAN: NOT THIS TIME. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE. WE NEED HELP. ODD BALL, DO YOU COPY?

ODD BALL: (OS) COPY, RED LEADER.

OBI-WAN: MARK MY POSITION AND FORM YOUR SQUAD UP BEHIND ME . . .

7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ODD BALL: WE'RE ON YOUR TAIL, GENERAL KENOBI. SET S-FOILS IN ATTACK POSITION.

THE PROTECTIVE RAY SHIELD LOWERS ON THE MAIN HANGAR OF THE TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, AND SIX NEW DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EMERGE AND JOIN THE DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS HEADING TOWARD THE JEDI. THE JEDI STARFIGHTERS EXTEND THE STABILITY FOILS ON THE ENDS OF THEIR WINGS.

8 INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN: THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS. TEN VULTURE DROIDS STRAIGHT AHEAD, COMING DOWN THE LEFT SIDE.

ARTOO BEEPS A WORRIED MESSAGE.

OBI-WAN: ADD FIVE TRI-FIGHTERS ON THE RIGHT . . .

ANAKIN: I'M GOING HEAD TO HEAD. SEE YOU.

OBI-WAN: TAKE IT EASY, ANAKIN.

FOUR CLONE FIGHTERS MOVE INTO FORMATION BEHIND THE JEDI.

ODD BALL: I'M ON YOUR RIGHT, RED LEADER.

ANAKIN: INCOMING!!

ARTOO SQUEALS AS FIVE DROID TRI-FIGHTERS PASS BY AT HIGH SPEED ON THE RIGHT.

OBI-WAN: FIVE MORE ON THE RIGHT!

FOUR MORE VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS PASS AT HIGH SPEED FROM THE LEFT. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN CONTINUE TO FLY IN UNISON, BACKING UP EACH OTHER. ARTOO SQUEALS.

ANAKIN: HERE WE GO.

THE JEDI SHIPS SPLIT UP AND MAKE A QUICK LOOP AROUND THE DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ENDING UP BEHIND THEM. BLASTING AWAY. THE DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.

OBI-WAN: I'M GOING HIGH AND RIGHT.

ANAKIN: HANG ON. THERE ARE FOUR MORE OF THEM.

OBI-WAN: STAY WITH ME . . . SWING BACK AND RIGHT . . . HELP ME ENGAGE. BACK OFF ... LET THEM PASS BETWEEN US.

ANAKIN: I'M COMING AROUND. I'M COMING AROUND ON YOUR TAIL.

OBI-WAN: ALL RIGHT, ENGAGE . . . AND HURRY. THESE DROIDS ARE ALL OVER ME LIKE A RASH.

IN ONE INCREDIBLE MOVE, ANAKIN SWINGS IN BEHIND THE DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, BLOWING THEM AWAY ONE BY ONE UNTIL THERE IS ONLY ONE LEFT. ARTOO CHIRPS.

ARTOO LETS OUT A HOWL AS ANAKIN ACCELERATES PAST THE LAST DROID TRI-FIGHTER, SLAMS ON HIS BRAKES, FLIPS THE FIGHTER AROUND, AND BLASTS THE FIGHTER FROM THE FRONT. ARTOO BEEPS FRANTICALLY AS THEY FLY THROUGH THE DEBRIS OF THE DESTROYED SHIPS. ANAKIN LOOKS BEHIND HIM.

ANAKIN: HOW MANY BACK THERE. ARTOO? (ARTOO BEEPS) THREE . . . (CONTINUING) FOUR . . . THAT'S NOT GOOD.

OBI-WAN: ANAKIN, YOU HAVE FOUR ON YOUR TAIL.

ANAKIN: I KNOW. I KNOW!

OBI-WAN: FOUR MORE CLOSING FROM YOUR LEFT.

ANAKIN: I KNOW. I KNOW!

OBI-WAN: BREAK RIGHT AND GO HIGH.

ANAKIN: I'M GOING LOW AND LEFT.

OBI-WAN SHAKES HIS HEAD.

OBI-WAN: (TO HIMSELF) HE STILL HAS MUCH TO LEARN.

ANAKIN SWOOPS LOW AND SKIMS ACROSS A TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, DODGING FLACK AS ARTOO BOUNCES ALONG, TRYING TO GET OUT A SENTENCE.

ANAKIN: HANG ON, ARTOO. OBI-WAN, DO YOU COPY? I'M GOING TO PULL THEM THROUGH THE NEEDLE . . .

OBI-WAN: TOO DANGEROUS. FIRST JEDI RULE: "SURVIVE."

ANAKIN: SORRY, NO CHOICE. COME DOWN HERE AND THIN THEM OUT A LITTLE.

OBI-WAN DROPS IN BEHIND THE DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS CHASING ANAKIN. ARFOUR BEEPS TO OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN: JUST KEEP ME STEADY . . . HOLD ON ... NOT YET. . . NOW BREAK LEFT.

OBI-WAN FIRES AS HE SWINGS ACROSS THE BACK OF THE VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING FOUR OF THEM AWAY. ANAKIN HEADS FOR A TRENCH ALONG THE SURFACE OF ONE OF THE TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS. HE FLIES INTO THE TRENCH, WHICH ENDS IN A CONNING TOWER WITH A SMALL SLIT BETWEEN TWO MAIN STRUTS.

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) YOU'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THERE, ANAKIN. IT'S TOO TIGHT.

ARTOO BEEPS NERVOUSLY.

ANAKIN: EASY, ARTOO . . . WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

OBI-WAN: USE THE FORCE, THINK YOURSELF THROUGH, THE SHIP WILL FOLLOW.

ARTOO SQUEALS IN A PANIC. ON THE VIEW SCREEN ARTOO'S SQUEAL READS OUT, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."

ANAKIN: WRONG THOUGHT, ARTOO.

ANAKIN SLIPS THROUGH THE NARROW GAP. THE TRAILING VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) I'M THROUGH.

OBI-WAN CONTINUES TO FIRE ON THE VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, DRIVING THEM INTO THE EXPLOSION.
A CLONE FIGHTER IS HIT AND EXPLODES, SPEWING DEBRIS. THE CLONE PILOT SPINS OFF INTO SPACE.
FINALLY, OBI-WAN PEELS OFF AND SWINGS AROUND, PULLING UP ALONGSIDE ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN BATTLES THE DROIDS.

ODD BALL: THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM.

CLONE PILOT 2: I'M ON YOUR WING. BREAK LEFT. BREAK LEFT. THEY'RE ALL OVER ME. GET THEM OFF MY . . .

ANAKIN: I'M GOING TO GO HELP THEM OUT!

OBI-WAN: NO, NO! THEY ARE DOING THEIR JOB SO WE CAN DO OURS. HEAD FOR THE COMMAND SHIP!

ANOTHER CLONE FIGHTER IS HIT, BURSTS INTO FLAMES, AND SPINS OFF INTO SPACE. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER RAISES ITS HEAD TO LOCATE ITS TARGET AND FIRES MISSILES AT THEM.

ANAKIN: MISSILES! PULL UP!

ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN BREAK RIGHT AND LEFT, AND THE MISSILES FOLLOW THEM. ANAKIN DOES A BARREL ROLL SPIN, CAUSING THE MISSILES FOLLOWING HIM TO COLLIDE AND EXPLODE. TWO MISSILES CONTINUE TO CHASE OBI-WAN. HE BANKS SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT, THEN TO THE LEFT, CAUSING ONE OF THE MISSILES TO OVERSHOOT.

OBI-WAN: THEY OVERSHOT US . . .

THE SECOND MISSILE STREAKS NEXT TO OBI-WAN�S FIGHTER AND EXPLODES. OBI-WAN'S SHIP ROCKS, AND R-4, SCREAMS AS THE STARFIGHTER RIPS THROUGH THE EXPLOSION. DEBRIS FLIES ALL AROUND THEM.

ANAKIN: THEY'RE COMING AROUND!

OBI-WAN: ALL RIGHT, ARFOUR. NO, NO. NOTHING TOO FANCY.

ANAKIN: SURGE ALL POWER UNITS. ARTOO! STAND BY THE REVERSE THRUSTERS.

ANAKIN SPINS HIS STARFIGHTER. THE MISSILES SPIN AND COLLIDE.

ANAKIN: WE GOT 'EM. ARTOO!

TWO MISSILES CONTINUE TO TRACK OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN: FLYING IS FOR DROIDS.

SUDDENLY, OBI-WAN SHUDDERS, AND HIS SHIP STARTS TO PLUMMET TOWARD THE SURFACE OF THE TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER. THE TRAILING MISSILES FLY INTO WHAT LOOKS LIKE DEBRIS, AND DETONATE. FIVE SILVER BALLS FLY OUT OF THE DEBRIS AND ATTACH THEMSELVES TO THE SHIP. THE BALLS POP OPEN, REVEALING SMALL BUZZDROIDS THAT BEGIN TO CRAWL ACROSS THE SURFACE LIKE SPIDERS.

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) I'M HIT! ANAKIN?

ANAKIN: I SEE THEM . . . BUZZ DROIDS.

THE BUZZ DROIDS CRAWL ACROSS OBI-WAN'S SHIP AND START TO TEAR IT APART. SPARKS ERUPT WHERE THE BUZZ DROIDS BREAK INTO THE WIRING. ONE OF THE BUZZ DROIDS GOES AFTER ARFOUR.

OBI-WAN: ARFOUR, BE CAREFUL. YOU HAVE ONE . . .

ARFOUR'S HEAD GETS RIPPED OFF AND FLIES AWAY.

OBI-WAN: OH DEAR. THEY'RE SHUTTING DOWN ALL THE CONTROLS.

ANAKIN: MOVE TO THE RIGHT SO I CAN GET A CLEAR SHOT AT THEM.

OBI-WAN: THE MISSION. GET TO THE COMMAND SHIP. GET THE CHANCELLOR! I'M RUNNING OUT OF TRICKS HERE.

ANAKIN MOVES INTO POSITION JUST OFF OBI-WAN'S LEFT SIDE AND ANGLES HIS SHIP SO HIS GUNS ARE POINTING AT THE DROIDS CRAWLING OVER OBI-WAN�S STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN FIRES AND VAPORIZES THE TWO BUZZ DROIDS, ALONG WITH THE LEFT WING OF OBI-WAN'S SHIP.

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) IN THE NAME OF ...

ANAKIN: STEADY . . . STEADY . . .

OBI-WAN: ANAKIN, HOLD YOUR FIRE . . . HOLD YOUR FIRE. YOU'RE NOT HELPING HERE.

ANAKIN: I AGREE, BAD IDEA. SWING RIGHT . . . EASE OVER . . . STEADY . . .

OBI-WAN: WAIT . . . WAIT . . . I CAN'T SEE A THING! MY COCKPIT'S FOGGING. THEY'RE ALL OVER ME, ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: MOVE TO THE RIGHT.

OBI-WAN: HOLD ON, ANAKIN. YOU'RE GOING TO GET US BOTH KILLED! GET OUT OF HERE. THERE'S NOTHING MORE YOU CAN DO.

ANAKIN: I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT YOU, MASTER.

ANAKIN MOVES HIS SHIP NEXT TO OBI-WAN'S AND TRIES TO PHYSICALLY KNOCK THE BUZZ DROIDS OFF. THERE ARE FIVE LEFT. HE MANAGES TO GET ONE OFF, BUT BADLY DENTS OBI-WAN'S SHIP IN THE PROCESS. ONE OF THE BUZZ DROIDS TEARS APIECE OFF OF THE FRONT OF OBI-WAN'S SHIP. FLAMES BURST OUT, AND MORE SMOKE BILLOWS OUT, OBSCURING THE JEDI'S VIEW.

ANAKIN KNOCKS OFF THREE OF THE BUZZ DROIDS AND THE FOURTH CRAWLS OUT ONTO ANAKIN'S SHIP AND STARTS ATTACKING ARTOO. ARTOO FIGHTS THE BUZZ DROID.

OBI-WAN: BLAST IT ... I CAN'T SEE . . . MY CONTROLS ARE GONE.

ANAKIN: GET 'EM, ARTOO. WATCH OUT!

OBI-WAN: ARTOO, HIT THE BUZZ DROID'S CENTER EYE.

ARTOO EXTENDS AN ARM AND AIMS A STREAM OF ELECTRICITY AT THE SWERVING BUZZ DROID. THE BUZZ DROID IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE EYE AND FALLS OFF THE SHIP.

ANAKIN: YEAH, YOU GOT HIM!

OBI-WAN: GREAT, ARTOO.

ANAKIN: STAY ON MY WING . . . THE GENERAL'S COMMAND SHIP IS DEAD AHEAD. EASY . . . PULL UP ... HEAD FOR THE HANGAR.

OBI-WAN: HAVE YOU NOTICED THE SHIELDS ARE STILL UP?

ANAKIN: OH?!? SORRY, MASTER.

ANAKIN STREAKS AHEAD OF OBI-WAN'S DISINTEGRATING JEDI FIGHTER AND BLASTS THE SHIELD GENERATOR. IT SPARKS AND EXPLODES.

OBI-WAN: OH, I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

THE SHIELD DOOR DROPS AWAY, AND OBI-WAN CRASHES ON THE DECK OF THE HANGAR BAY, ENGULFED IN A FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A SET OF BLAST DOORS STARTS SLAMMING SHUT ACROSS THE HANGAR OPENING, AS MATERIAL IS SUCKED INTO SPACE.

ANAKIN MANEUVERS AROUND THE ONCOMING JUNK AND FLIES INTO THE HANGAR JUST AS THE BLAST DOORS SLAM SHUT.
OBI-WAN IGNITES HIS LIGHT SABER AND CUTS HIS WAY OUT OF THE COCKPIT. HE JUMPS DEAR JUST AS HIS SHIP EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS RUSH AT HIM FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

ANAKIN JUMPS OUT OF HIS SHIP AND CUTS HIS WAY THROUGH THE BATTLE DROIDS TO WHERE OBI-WAN IS FIGHTING. ARTOO POPS OUT OF THE SHIP AND FOLLOWS ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN: ARTOO, LOCATE THE CHANCELLOR.

ANAKIN: TAP INTO THE SHIP'S COMPUTERS.

THEY CUT DOWN THE LAST OF THE DROIDS AND FOLLOW ARTOO OVER TO A COMPUTER WALL SOCKET. THE TWO JEDI FIGHT OFF FOUR MORE DROIDS AS ARTOO TRIES TO FIND THE CHANCELLOR. FINALLY, A HOLOGRAM OF THE TRADE FEDERATION SHIP APPEARS.

OBI-WAN: THE CHANCELLOR'S SIGNAL IS COMING FROM RIGHT THERE. THE OBSERVATION PLATFORM AT THE TOP OF THAT SPIRE.

ANAKIN: I SENSE COUNT DOOKU . . .

OBI-WAN: I SENSE A TRAP.

ANAKIN: NEXT MOVE?

OBI-WAN: SPRING THE TRAP.

THE JEDI START TO LEAVE; ARTOO FOLLOWS. THE JEDI STOP AND TURN TO ARTOO.

ANAKIN: ARTOO, GO BACK. I NEED YOU TO STAY WITH THE SHIP.

OBI-WAN: HERE, TAKE THIS, AND WAIT FOR ORDERS.

OBI-WAN TOSSES THE COMLINK TO ARTOO.

10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS ENTERS THE BRIDGE OF THE TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER FOLLOWED BY HIS TWO BODYGUARDS. HE WALKS TO THE FRONT OF THE BRIDGE AND STANDS IN FRONT OF THE NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: WHAT'S THE SITUATION, CAPTAIN?

CAPTAIN: TWO JEDI HAVE LANDED IN THE MAIN HANGAR BAY.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: JUST AS COUNT DOOKU PREDICTED.

11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN HEAD FOR THE ELEVATOR. A DOOR OPENS IN THE HALLWAY AND TWO OF GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S BODYGUARDS CONFRONT THE JEDI.

BODYGUARD I: GENERAL KENOBI, ANAKIN SKYWALKER. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

OBI-WAN: WE ARE HERE TO RELIEVE YOU OF CHANCELLOR PALPATINE, NOT JOIN HIM.

AS A DOZEN MORE DROIDS JOIN THE GROUP, THE JEDI IGNITE THEIR LIGHTSABERS AND STAND BACK-TO-BACK.

OBI-WAN: ANAKIN. . .

ANAKIN: READY.

ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN USE THEIR LIGHTSABERS AND CUT A LARGE CIRCLE IN THE FLOOR.

12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

THE TWO JEDI CUT THEIR WAY DOWN SEVERAL FLOORS INTO A LARGE GENERATOR ROOM. HUGE EXPLOSIONS OUTSIDE THE SHIP HAVE CAUSED SEVERAL LARGE PIPES OVERHEAD TO BREAK, AND FLUID IS SPEWING EVERYWHERE. THE JEDI GET UP AND TURN OFF THEIR LIGHT SABERS. ANAKIN DIPS HIS HAND INTO THE FLUID AND SNIFFS IT.

OBI-WAN: . . . FUEL. THE SLIGHTEST CHARGE FROM OUR SABERS WILL SEND THIS SHIP INTO OBLIVION. THAT'S WHY THEY'VE STOPPED SHOOTING.

ANAKIN: WELL THEN, WE'RE SAFE FOR THE TIME BEING.

OBI-WAN: YOUR IDEA OF SAFE IS NOT THE SAME AS MINE.

THEY RUN, EXPLOSIONS RATTLE THE SHIP, AND PIPES CONTINUE TO BURST AROUND THEM, SPILLING MORE FUEL INTO THE HALLWAY. AT THE FAR END, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS DROP INTO THE FUEL. THE SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO THROUGHOUT THE HALLWAY. THEY PASS SEVERAL LARGE POWER GENERATORS, WHICH ARE TOPPED WITH SPARKING EXCESS POWER DISCHARGERS.

ANAKIN: THEY'RE SEALING THIS SECTION OFF.

OBI-WAN: SIX DROIDS COMING OUR WAY!

THE LAST OF THE DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING IN THE DISTANCE.

ANAKIN: KEEP MOVING. THERE MUST BE VENTS . . . THIS WAY.

THEY MOVE ALONG A WALL. ANAKIN CLIMBS UP THE SIDE TO A SMALL VENT. THE FUEL GETS CLOSER TO THE SPARKING DISCHARGERS.

OBI-WAN: WE'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THAT. IT'S TOO SMALL!

THEY MOVE TOWARD A SECOND VENT. OBI-WAN IS SWIMMING IN THE FUEL AS IT REACHES TO WITHIN A COUPLE YARDS OF THE CEILING. ANAKIN FEELS ALONG THE CEILING AND FINDS ANOTHER SMALLER VENT. HE CLOSES HIS EYES AND TRIES TO SENSE AN OPENING, THEN HE MOVES ON. OBI-WAN IS FORCED INTO HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH ONE OF THE SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. IT PULLS THE JEDI UNDER THE FUEL. JUST BEFORE HE IS ABOUT TO DROWN, OBI-WAN DISABLES THE SUPER BATTLE DROID BY PUSHING HIM INTO AN EXHAUST PIPE.

THE FUEL IS UP TO THE JEDI'S CHINS. ANAKIN FINDS A VERY, VERY SMALL METAL GRATE, THEN POUNDS ON IT UNTIL THE TINY GRATE BREAKS LOOSE.

ANAKIN: I FOUND OUR ESCAPE VENT.

OBI-WAN: ANAKIN, THIS IS NO TIME FOR JOKES. WE'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE HERE.

ANAKIN: ONLY IN YOUR MIND. MY MASTER. LOOK, NO STRUCTURE. . . .

ANAKIN GRABS THE SIDE OF THE TINY HOLE AND GIVES IT A BIG YANK, RIPPING A LARGE PANEL LOOSE REVEALING A "MAN-SIZED" WORK SHAFT. THEY SCRAMBLE THROUGH IT AS THE DROIDS SWIM CLOSER.

13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

THE TWO JEDI PULL THEMSELVES THROUGH THE NARROW VENT SHAFT UNTIL THEY REACH A SMALL HATCH IN THE SIDE OF THE TUBE.

OBI-WAN: THAT WON'T HOLD WHEN THE FUEL HITS THOSE POWER DISCHARGERS.

ANAKIN: THE BLAST WILL BREAK THE HULL. THIS SIDE'S PRESSURIZED.

OBI-WAN: YOU STILL HAVE MUCH TO LEARN, ANAKIN.

16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

THE SUPER BATTLE DROIDS CLIMB UP THE VENT SHAFT. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 AND SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS WAIT IN THE GENERATOR ROOM AS THE FUEL CONTINUES TO RISE TOWARD THE POWER DISCHARGER.

ANAKIN GRINS AT OBI-WAN, AND THEY RUN DOWN THE HALLWAY.

20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

THE TWO JEDI WAIT FOR AN ELEVATOR TO ARRIVE. THEY TURN AROUND AND SEE THEY ARE FACE TO FACE WITH THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. THE DROIDS START BLASTING AWAY. ANAKIN DEFLECTS THE BOLTS. OBI-WAN FRANTICALLY PUSHES THE ELEVATOR BUTTON SEVERAL MORE TIMES.

ANAKIN: DESTROYERS!!

FINALLY THE DOOR OPENS, AND THEY RUSH INSIDE UNDER A HAIL OF LASER BOLTS. THE ELEVATOR DOOR SLIDES SHUT. THE JEDI TURN TO SEE BATTLE DROIDS STANDING BEHIND THEM.

34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN LOOKS DOWN AND SEES THE ELEVATOR HEADING TOWARD HIM AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. HE LOOKS AT THE BATTLE DROIDS LEANING OVER HIM WITH THEIR GUNS POINTED AT HIM. HE CALCULATES FOR A MOMENT, THEN GIVES HIMSELF A PUSH AND FLIPS HIMSELF UP INTO THE ELEVATOR SHAFT.

BEFORE ANAKIN CAN ARC INTO A DESCENT DOWN THE SHAFT, THE ELEVATOR RACES UP THROUGH THE SHAFT, CUTTING THE DROIDS IN TWO. ANAKIN LANDS ON THE ELEVATOR AND QUICKLY DROPS BACK THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE CEILING. OBI-WAN IS STARTLED AND IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER.

OBI-WAN: OH, IT'S YOU . . .

35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

THE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS AND THE TWO JEDI CAREFULLY MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE MAIN ROOM OF THE GENERAL'S QUARTERS.
AT THE FAR END SITS SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN MOVE TOWARD THE CHANCELLOR.
AS THEY GET CLOSER TO PALPATINE, THEY SEE A VERY DISTRESSED LOOK ON THE CHANCELLOR'S FACE.

OBI-WAN: (BOWS) CHANCELLOR.

ANAKIN: ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

PALPATINE: (QUIETLY) COUNT DOOKU.

PALPATINE MAKES A SMALL GESTURE WITH HIS HAND. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN TURN AROUND. THE ELEVATOR DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING AS COUNT DOOKU STRIDES INTO THE ROOM. HE IS ABOVE THE JEDI, STANDING ON A BALCONY, WITH TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. THE JEDI TURN TO SEE HIM. HE LOOKS DOWN ON THE JEDI.

OBI-WAN: (QUIETLY TO ANAKIN) THIS TIME WE WILL DO IT TOGETHER.

ANAKIN: I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT.

COUNT DOOKU JUMPS DOWN TO THE MAIN LEVEL.

PALPATINE: GET HELP! YOU'RE NO MATCH FOR HIM. HE'S A SITH LORD.

OBI-WAN: CHANCELLOR PALPATINE, SITH LORDS ARE OUR SPECIALTY.

OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN THROW OFF THEIR CLOAKS AND IGNITE THEIR LIGHTSABERS.

COUNT DOOKU: YOUR SWORDS, PLEASE, MASTER JEDI. WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE A MESS OF THINGS IN FRONT OF THE CHANCELLOR.

OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN MOVE TOWARD DOOKU.

OBI-WAN: YOU WON'T GET AWAY THIS TIME, DOOKU.

OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN CHARGE COUNT DOOKU. A GREAT SWORD FIGHT ENSUES.

COUNT DOOKU: I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS.

ANAKIN: MY POWERS HAVE DOUBLED SINCE THE LAST TIME WE MET, COUNT.

COUNT DOOKU: GOOD. TWICE THE PRIDE, DOUBLE THE FALL.

DOOKU LUNGES AT THE JEDI AND THEY FALL BACK . . .

COUNT DOOKU: (CONTINUING) YOUR MOVES ARE CLUMSY, KENOBI . . . TOO PREDICTABLE. YOU'LL HAVE TO DO BETTER.

AS THE BATTLE PROCEEDS, OBI-WAN AND COUNT DOOKU ARE TIRED. ANAKIN IS STRONGER AS HE BECOMES ANGRY. ANAKIN CONTINUES TO DRIVE THE ATTACK ON DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU THROWS OBI-WAN BACK USING THE FORCE.
ANAKIN AND COUNT DOOKU MOVE UP THE STAIRS. AS THEY REACH THE UPPER LANDING OF THE GENERAL'S QUARTERS, ANAKIN LEAPS OVER COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN REACHES THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, DESTROYING TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU HOLDS OBI-WAN IN THE AIR USING THE FORCE AS HE TURNS AND KICKS ANAKIN OUT OF FRAME. OBI-WAN IS CHOKING.
ANAKIN HITS THE ARCHWAY.
DOOKU SENDS OBI-WAN FLYING. THE JEDI TUMBLES TO THE LOWER LEVEL UNCONSCIOUS. COUNT DOOKU SPINS AROUND AGAIN AND, USING THE FORCE, CAUSES A SECTION OF THE BALCONY TO DROP ONTO OBI-WAN. ANAKIN SPINS AND KICKS COUNT DOOKU, SENDING HIM OVER THE BALCONY. ANAKIN JUMPS, FOLLOWING HIM DOWN TO THE MAIN FLOOR. COUNT DOOKU AND ANAKIN CONTINUE THE FIGHT.

COUNT DOOKU: (CONTINUING) I SENSE GREAT FEAR IN YOU, SKYWALKER. YOU HAVE HATE, YOU HAVE ANGER, BUT YOU DON�T USE THEM.

THE JEDI CATCHES THE LIGHTSABER AS IT DROPS FROM THE SEVERED SITH LORD'S HAND. COUNT DOOKU STUMBLES TO THE FLOOR AS ANAKIN PUTS THE TWO LIGHTSABERS TO HIS NECK. PALPATINE IS GRINNING AS HE WATCHES COUNT DOOKU'S DEFEAT.

PALPATINE: GOOD, ANAKIN, GOOD. I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT. KILL HIM. KILL HIM NOW!

ANAKIN: I SHOULDN'T . . .

PALPATINE: DO IT!!

ANAKIN CUTS OFF COUNT DOOKU'S HEAD. A HUGE EXPLOSION SOMEWHERE DEEP IN THE SHIP RATTLES EVERYTHING.

ANAKIN: ... I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF.

PALPATINE: YOU DID WELL, ANAKIN. HE WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO BE KEPT ALIVE.

ANAKIN DROPS COUNT DOOKU'S LIGHTSABER, MOVING TO PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: YES, BUT HE WAS AN UNARMED PRISONER.

ANAKIN RAISES HIS HANDS TOWARD PALPATINE, WHO IS STRAPPED IN THE ADMIRAL'S CHAIR. THE CHANCELLOR'S RESTRAINTS POP LOOSE.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT, CHANCELLOR. IT'S NOT THE JEDI WAY.

PALPATINE STANDS UP, RUBBING HIS WRISTS.

PALPATINE: IT IS ONLY NATURAL. HE CUT OFF YOUR ARM, AND YOU WANTED REVENGE. IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME, ANAKIN. REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR MOTHER AND THE SAND PEOPLE. NOW, WE MUST LEAVE BEFORE MORE SECURITY DROIDS ARRIVE.

THE SHIP BEGINS TO LIST TO ONE SIDE. ANAKIN RUSHES OVER TO OBI-WAN, LIFTS THE CONTROL CONSOLE FROM ON TOP OF HIM, AND PULLS HIM FREE. HE KNEELS DOWN AND CHECKS OUT HIS UNCONSCIOUS FRIEND. PALPATINE HEADS FOR THE ELEVATORS.

PALPATINE: (CONTINUING) ANAKIN, THERE IS NO TIME. WE MUST GET OFF THE SHIP BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

ANAKIN: HE SEEMS TO BE ALL RIGHT. NO BROKEN BONES, BREATHING'S ALL RIGHT.

PALPATINE: LEAVE HIM, OR WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT.

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, AND PALPATINE HANG PRECARIOUSLY ON THE SIDE OF THE BOTTOMLESS ELEVATOR SHAFT. OBI-WAN REGAINS CONSCIOUSNESS AND TRIES TO LOOK AROUND.

ANAKIN: EASY. . . . WE'RE IN A BIT OF A SITUATION.

OBI-WAN: DID I MISS SOMETHING?

OBI-WAN LOOKS DOWN AND SEES PALPATINE AND THE BOTTOMLESS PIT. THEY HEAR ARTOO BEEPING ON OBI-WAN'S COMLINK. THE SHIP BEGINS TO ROLL, CAUSING THE VERTICAL SHAFT TO MOVE INTO A FORTY-FIVE-DEGREE ANGLE. THEY HEAR THE ELEVATOR BRAKES RELEASE AND LOOK UP TO SEE THE ELEVATOR HEADING TOWARD THEM.

ANAKINN: HOLD ON.

OBI-WAN: WHAT IS THAT?

OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN LOOK UP TO WATCH THE ELEVATOR APPROACH THEM AT HIGH SPEED, THEN OBI-WAN TURNS TO ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) OOPS.

ANAKIN: ARTOO, ARTOO, SHUT DOWN THE ELEVATOR!

OBI-WAN: TOO LATE! JUMP!

THEY FALL ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FEET BEFORE THE TILT OF THE SHIP CATCHES UP WITH THEM, AND THEY HIT THE SIDE OF THE SHAFT AND SLIDE AT GREAT SPEED JUST AHEAD OF THE ELEVATOR. THE SHAFT CONTINUES TO ROTATE UNTIL IT IS COMPLETELY HORIZONTAL.
ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN TAKE OUT AND THROW GRAPPLING HOOKS. THE HOOKS CATCH AND THEY CONTINUE TO FALL. ALL THE DOORS IN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT OPEN UP, AND THE GROUP SWINGS THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR INTO A HALLWAY. THE ELEVATOR ROARS BY.

57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

IT IS EXTREMELY WINDY AS BITS AND PIECES ARE CONTINUALLY SUCKED INTO SPACE. THE HANGAR BAY DOORS ARE CLOSED, BUT GREAT STRESSES ARE BEING EXERTED AS THE SHIP TWISTS, RE-ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE OF CORUSCANT. THEY STOP IN A DOORWAY LEADING INTO THE HANGAR BAY.

OBI-WAN: NONE OF THOSE SHIPS WILL GET US ANYWHERE.

ANAKIN: I AGREE.

PALPATINE: WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

ANAKIN: I DON'T KNOW.

OBI-WAN: DON'T LOOK AT ME. I DON'T KNOW.

ANAKIN AND PALPATINE BOTH LOOK TO OBI-WAN. HE SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER HAS BEEN SUCKED OUT OF THE HANGAR BAY AND IS TOTALED. SUDDENLY, THE SHIP TURNS ON ITS SIDE.

ANAKIN: HERE, CHANCELLOR, LOCK THIS AROUND YOUR WAIST, AND HOLD ON.

OBI-WAN: WE'LL HEAD TOWARD THE BRIDGE AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND AN ESCAPE POD.

ANAKIN HANDS PALPATINE THE END OF A CABLE THAT IS ATTACHED TO HIS UTILITY BELT. PALPATINE ATTACHES IT AROUND HIS WAIST. ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN THROW THEIR UTILITY CABLES TO SOME PIPES IN THE CEILING AND SWING TO A SECOND SET OF PIPES.

58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN GRABS ONTO THE PIPES THAT RUN ALONG WHAT WAS THE CEILING AND IS NOW THE WALL. AS HE MOVES OUT INTO THE HANGAR, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS START FIRING AT HIM. THE JEDI IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER AND DEFLECTS THE BOLTS BACK AT THE DROIDS, BLOWING THEM UP. ANAKIN AND PALPATINE FOLLOW OBI-WAN ALONG THE PIPES RUNNING ALONG THE CEILING OF THE HANGAR. PALPATINE STRUGGLES AGAINST THE ESCAPING AIR OF THE PRESSURIZED HANGAR. PALPATINE LOSES HIS GRIP AS A PIPE BREAKS, CAUSING A RUSH OF STEAM, BUT ANAKIN MANAGES TO MAINTAIN HIS GRASP ON THE PIPE AS THE CHANCELLOR DANGLES ON THE OTHER END OF THE UTILITY CABLE. THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY SPARKS AND EXPLOSIONS AS THE SHIP TWISTS AND TRIES TO BREAK APART. ANAKIN MOVES OUT OF THE STEAM AND STRUGGLES TO PULL PALPATINE BACK TO SAFETY. ANAKIN IS ALMOST PULLED LOOSE IN THE BUFFETING WINDS. THE CEILING BEHIND THEM BUCKLES, CAUSING PIPES TO BREAK, CREATING GEYSERS OF STEAM. SOME BITS OF PIPE GO HURLING INTO THE BLAST DOORS AND OUT INTO SPACE. THEY MAKE IT THROUGH A HANGAR DOORWAY AND CLOSE IT BEHIND THEM.

THEY RUN DOWN THE HALLWAY. SUDDENLY, RAY SHIELDS DROP AROUND THEM, PUTTING THEM IN AN ELECTRONIC BOX IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY.

ANAKIN: RAY SHIELDS!

OBI-WAN TAKES A DEEP BREATH TO EXPRESS HIS TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.

OBI-WAN: WAIT A MINUTE, HOW'D THIS HAPPEN! WE'RE SMARTER THAN THIS.

ANAKIN: APPARENTLY NOT, MASTER. THIS IS THE OLDEST TRAP IN THE BOOK . . . WELL ... I WAS DISTRACTED.

OBI-WAN: OH, SO ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S MY FAULT.

ANAKIN: YOU'RE THE MASTER. I'M JUST A HERO.

OBI-WAN: I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS HERE.

PALPATINE: WHY DON'T WE LET THEM TAKE US TO GENERAL GRIEVOUS. PERHAPS WITH COUNT DOOKU'S DEMISE, WE CAN NEGOTIATE OUR RELEASE.

THE JEDI LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN DISBELIEF.

ANAKIN: I SAY . . . PATIENCE.

OBI-WAN: PATIENCE! THAT'S YOUR PLAN, IS IT?

ANAKIN: YES, ARTOO WILL BE ALONG IN A FEW MOMENTS AND HE'LL RELEASE THE RAY SHIELDS . . .

ARTOO COMES SKIDDING ACROSS THE HALLWAY AND BASHES INTO THE OPPOSITE WALL. HE TAKES A MOMENT TO COMPOSE HIMSELF.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) SEE! NO PROBLEM.

SUDDENLY SEVERAL DOORWAYS OPEN, REVEALING TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS EMERGE FROM BEHIND THE DESTROYER DROIDS.
ARTOO TURNS AND ZAPS ONE OF THE SUPER BATTLE DROIDS WHO THEN KICKS ARTOO OVER.

SUPER BATTLE DROID: DON'T MOVE, DUMMY. OUCH! ZAP THIS.

OBI-WAN: DO YOU HAVE A PLAN B?

62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, AND ARTOO ARE CAPTURED BY GENERAL GRIEVOUS. THEY STAND BEFORE THE ALIEN DROID GENERAL.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: OH YES. GENERAL KENOBI, THE NEGOTIATOR. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU. THAT WASN'T MUCH OF A RESCUE.

A BATTLE DROID WALKS TO GENERAL GRIEVOUS AND HANDS HIM THE JEDI'S LIGHTSABERS.

OBI-WAN: THAT DEPENDS UPON YOUR POINT OF VIEW. HAH!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: AND ANAKIN SKYWALKER ... I WAS EXPECTING SOMEONE WITH YOUR REPUTATION TO BE A LITTLE OLDER.

ANAKIN: GENERAL GRIEVOUS . . . SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE DROID ARMIES. YOU'RE SHORTER THAN I EXPECTED.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: AHHHH, JEDI SCUM . . .

OBI-WAN: ANAKIN, TRY NOT TO UPSET HIM. WE HAVE A JOB TO DO.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: YOUR LIGHTSABERS WILL MAKE A FINE ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION.

OBI-WAN: NOT THIS TIME. AND THIS TIME YOU WON'T ESCAPE.

ANAKIN: ARTOO.

ARTOO CREATES A DISTRACTION BY EXTENDING ALL HIS ARMS, SHOOTING OUT ELECTRICAL PULSES, AND BOUNCING AROUND.
OBI-WAN, HANDS RESTRAINED WITH ELECTROBONDS, SPINS AROUND, REACHES OUT AND, USING THE FORCE, YANKS HIS LIGHTSABER OUT OF THE GENERAL'S HAND, IGNITES IT, AND CUTS HIS BONDS. HE CONTINUES TO SPIN AROUND AND CUTS ANAKIN FREE.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: CRUSH THEM! MAKE THEM SUFFER!

ANAKIN USES THE FORCE TO YANK HIS LIGHTSABER OUT OF THE GENERAL'S HAND.

THE DROIDS THAT SURROUND THEM BEGIN TO FIRE. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN JUMP INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. THE BRIDGE DEGENERATES INTO CHAOS. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN ARE LOCKED IN A PITCHED BATTLE BETWEEN ELECTRO STAFFS AND LASER SWORDS WITH GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S TWO BODYGUARDS.

CHANCELLOR PALPATINE IS TAKEN AWAY BY TWO BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS WALKS AROUND THE BRIDGE DIRECTING THE BATTLE DROIDS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: STAY AND WATCH YOUR STATIONS.

OBI-WAN FIGHTS ONE OF GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S BODYGUARDS. THE BODYGUARD CARRIES AN ELECTRIFIED STAFF ABOUT FIVE FEET LONG. WHEN THE LASER SWORD HITS IT, ELECTRICAL BOLTS FLY EVERYWHERE AND SURROUND THE LASER SWORD. OBI-WAN IS UNABLE TO CUT THE STAFF. THE JEDI GETS WHACKED PRETTY GOOD A COUPLE OF TIMES AND IS KNOCKED HALFWAY ACROSS THE BRIDGE.
OBI-WAN PULLS HIMSELF TOGETHER AND ATTACKS AGAIN, CUTTING OFF THE DROID BODYGUARD'S HEAD. THE DROID BODYGUARD KEEPS ATTACKING. ANAKIN STRUGGLES TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THE OTHER MANIC DROID BODYGUARD. HE CUTS THE DROID BODYGUARD IN HALF. TWO BATTLE DROIDS TRY TO TAKE THE CHANCELLOR AWAY.
ANAKIN FOLLOWS THEM DOWN THE HALLWAY AND CUTS THEM DOWN, RESCUING THE CHANCELLOR.
OBI-WAN FINISHES OFF THE HEADLESS BODYGUARD. IT CRUMBLES TO THE FLOOR IN PIECES.
ALARMS SOUND AS THE GIANT SPACECRAFT BEGINS TO LIST AND FALL OUT OF ORBIT. A PILOT YELLS AT GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

PILOT: SIR, WE ARE FALLING OUT OF ORBIT. ALL AFT CONTROL CELLS ARE DEAD.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: STAY ON COURSE . . . DON'T BOTHER WITH THEM. KEEP THE SHIP IN ORBIT.

OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN DESTROY THE REMAINING DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS RETRIEVES ONE OF THE BODYGUARD'S STAFFS AND FACES OBI-WAN. ANAKIN LEAPS OVER A CONSOLE AND LANDS BEHIND GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: YOU LOSE, GENERAL KENOBI.

ONE OF THE PILOTS STANDS NEXT TO THE GENERAL.

PILOT: THE SHIP IS BREAKING UP!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: WE'VE RUN OUT OF TIME.

OBI-WAN TRIES TO GET AT GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN RUNS AT THE GENERAL FROM THE OPPOSING SIDE. GENERAL GRIEVOUS TURNS AND THROWS HIS ELECTRIFIED STAFF AT THE WINDOW. IT BREAKS, CAUSING CHAOS AS EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT NAILED DOWN IS SUCKED INTO SPACE. GENERAL GRIEVOUS IS THE FIRST ONE SUCKED OUT INTO SPACE. HE FIRES A CABLE FROM HIS ARM THAT ATTACHES TO THE SHIP. HE SWINGS IN AND LANDS FIRMLY ON THE SIDE OF THE SHIP.
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, AND PALPATINE HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE. A BLAST SHIELD CLOSES AROUND WHERE THE WINDOW USED TO BE.

63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN CONTINUES TO FIGHT THE BATTLE DROIDS. THE DROIDS HAVE BACKED HIM INTO A CORNER. OBI-WAN HIDES BEHIND A CONTROL PANEL AS THE DROIDS BLAST AWAY AT HIM. HE JUMPS UP AND OVER THE DROIDS, CUTTING MOST OF THEM DOWN BEFORE HE LANDS. HE DESTROYS THE DROIDS AND JOINS ANAKIN.
ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN CUT THROUGH THE REST OF THE DROIDS AS IF THEY WERE MADE OF BUTTER. PALPATINE STANDS IN SHOCK AS HE WATCHES THE CARNAGE. DROID PARTS ARE FIRING EVERYWHERE. OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN STAND BACK TO BACK AND CUT DOWN THE LAST OF THE DROIDS JUST AS THERE IS A HUGE SHUDDER, FOLLOWED BY MORE ALARMS. SPARKS BEGIN TO FLY OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS.

PALPATINE: THE HULL IS BURNING UP!

64 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

GENERAL GRIEVOUS DETACHES HIS CABLE AND CRAWLS ALONG THE EXTERIOR HULL OF THE FEDERATION CRUISER, USING HIS MAGNETIZED HANDS AND FEET. HE REACHES A ROW OF ESCAPE PODS AND ENTERS AN AIRLOCK.

65 INT. POD BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

GENERAL GRIEVOUS ENTERS THE ESCAPE POD BAY THROUGH THE HATCH. THE DROID GENERAL GOES TO A CONTROL PANEL AND OPENS AN ESCAPE POD.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: TIME TO ABANDON SHIP.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS PULLS A ROW OF SWITCHES, AND ONE BY ONE THE ESCAPE PODS ARE JETTISONED.

66 INT. ESCAPE POD-SPACE

HE GETS IN ONE, THE HATCH CLOSES, AND THE ESCAPE POD BLASTS AWAY FROM THE DAMAGED CRUISER.

67 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN AND ANAKIN GO OVER TO THE NAVIGATOR'S CHAIR.

ANAKIN: ALL THE ESCAPE PODS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED.

OBI-WAN: GRIEVOUS. CAN YOU FLY A CRUISER LIKE THIS?

ANAKIN: YOU MEAN, DO I KNOW HOW TO LAND WHAT'S LEFT OF THIS THING?

ANAKIN SITS IN THE PILOT'S CHAIR AND SEES ON A SCREEN THE BACK HALF OF THE SHIP BREAK AWAY. THERE IS A GREAT JOLT, AND THE SHIP TILTS FORWARD.

OBI-WAN: WELL?

ANAKIN: UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I'D SAY THE ABILITY TO PILOT THIS THING IS IRRELEVANT. STRAP YOURSELVES IN.

OBI-WAN AND PALPATINE STRAP THEMSELVES INTO CHAIRS. ANAKIN STRUGGLES WITH THE CONTROLS OF THE SHIP. THE SHIP STARTS TO GLOW, AND PIECES BREAK OFF. ARTOO MOVES IN ON PALPATINE 'S CONTROLS AND ASSISTS IN FLYING THE CRUISER.

OBI-WAN: STEADY . . . ATTITUDE . . . EIGHTEEN DEGREES.

ARTOO BEEPS.

ANAKIN: PRESSURE RISING. WE'VE GOT TO SLOW THIS WRECK DOWN. OPEN ALL HATCHES, EXTEND ALL FLAPS, AND DRAG FINS.

OBI-WAN: TEMP STEADY. HATCHES OPEN, FLAPS EXTENDED, DRAG FINS . . .

A LARGE PART OF THE SHIP BREAKS AWAY.

ANAKIN: WE LOST SOMETHING.

OBI-WAN: NOT TO WORRY, WE'RE STILL FLYING HALF THE SHIP.

ANAKIN: NOW WE'RE REALLY PICKING UP SPEED . . . I'M GOING TO SHIFT A FEW DEGREES AND SEE IF I CAN SLOW US DOWN.

OBI-WAN: CAREFUL . . . WE'RE HEATING UP-TWELVE THOUSAND . . . THIRTEEN THOUSAND . . .

ANAKIN: WHAT'S OUR SPEED?

OBI-WAN: EIGHT PLUS SIXTY-FORTY. EIGHT PLUS SIXTY-TWENTY. EIGHT PLUS SIXTY. TEMP TEN THOUSAND, NINE THOUSAND . . . WE'RE IN THE ATMOSPHERE . . .

ANAKIN POINTS TO ONE OF THE CONTROLS. ARTOO BEEPS MADLY.

ANAKIN: GRAB THAT . . . KEEP US LEVEL.

OBI-WAN: STEADY. STEADY.

ANAKIN: EASY, ARTOO. HANG ON, THIS MAY GET A LITTLE ROUGH. WE LOST OUR HEAT SHIELDS.

OBI-WAN: FIVE THOUSAND. THREE THOUSAND . . . TWO THOUSAND. FIRESHIPS ON THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT.

FLRESHIP PILOT: WE'LL TAKE YOU IN.

OBI-WAN: COPY THAT. LANDING STRIP'S STRAIGHT AHEAD.

ANAKIN: WE'RE COMING IN TOO HOT.

OBI-WAN: EASY-EASY.

THE SHIP LEAVES A CONTRAIL AS IT STREAKS ACROSS THE CORUSCANT SKYLINE. PALPATINE AND OBI-WAN HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE AS THE SHIP SHAKES AND RATTLES TOWARD AN INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM.

68 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM-AFTERNOON

A LARGE LANDING PLATFORM IN THE INDUSTRIAL PART OF THE CITY IS SURROUNDED BY EMERGENCY FIRE SPEEDERS. THE SMOKING SHIP APPROACHES AS FIVE FIRESHIPS SPRAY IT WITH FOAM. THE SHIP FINALLY MAKES A RATHER HARD LANDING.

OBI-WAN: ANOTHER HAPPY LANDING.

69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON

THE SMALL JEDI SHUTTLE CARRYING PALPATINE AND THE JEDI ARRIVES AT THE LANDING PLATFORM. THERE ARE A DOZEN SENATORS, INCLUDING BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, AND C-3PO, WAITING FOR THEM. PALPATINE, R2-D2, AND ANAKIN GET OUT. OBI-WAN AND MACE STAY IN THE DOORWAY OF THE JEDI SHUTTLE.

ANAKIN: (TO OBI-WAN) ARE YOU COMING, MASTER?

OBI-WAN: OH NO. I'M NOT BRAVE ENOUGH FOR POLITICS. I HAVE TO REPORT TO THE COUNCIL. BESIDES, SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE THE POSTER BOY.

ANAKIN: HOLD ON, THIS WHOLE OPERATION WAS YOUR IDEA. YOU PLANNED IT. YOU LED THE RESCUE OPERATION. YOU HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO TAKE THE BOWS THIS TIME.

OBI-WAN: SORRY, OLD FRIEND. LET US NOT FORGET THAT YOU RESCUED ME FROM THE BUZZ DROIDS. AND YOU KILLED COUNT DOOKU. AND YOU RESCUED THE CHANCELLOR, CARRYING ME UNCONSCIOUS ON YOUR BACK, AND YOU MANAGED TO LAND THAT BUCKET OF BOLTS SAFELY . . .

ANAKIN: ALL BECAUSE OF YOUR TRAINING, MASTER. YOU DESERVE ALL THOSE SPEECHES OF YOUR GREATNESS.

OBI-WAN: . . . THE ENDLESS SPEECHES . . . ANAKIN, LET'S BE FAIR. TODAY, YOU ARE THE HERO AND YOU DESERVE YOUR GLORIOUS DAY WITH THE POLITICIANS.

ANAKIN: ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU OWE ME . . . AND NOT FOR SAVING YOUR SKIN FOR THE TENTH TIME . . .

OBI-WAN: NINTH TIME . . . THAT BUSINESS ON CATO NEMOIDIA DOESN'T COUNT. I'LL SEE YOU AT THE BRIEFING.

ANAKIN SMILES AND WALKS AWAY FROM OBI-WAN.
THE CHANCELLOR AND HIS ENTOURAGE APPROACH MACE.

MACE WLNDU: CHANCELLOR PALPATINE, WHAT A WELCOME SIGHT! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

PALPATINE: YES, THANKS TO YOUR TWO JEDI KNIGHTS. THEY KILLED COUNT DOOKU, BUT GENERAL GRIEVOUS HAS ESCAPED ONCE AGAIN.

MACE WLNDU: GENERAL GRIEVOUS WILL RUN AND HIDE AS HE ALWAYS DOES. HE IS A COWARD.

PALPATINE: THAT MAYBE TRUE, BUT WITH COUNT DOOKU DEAD, HE IS THE LEADER OF THE DROID ARMY, AND I ASSURE YOU, THE SENATE WILL VOTE TO CONTINUE THE WAR AS LONG AS GRIEVOUS IS ALIVE.

MACE WLNDU: THEN THE JEDI COUNCIL WILL MAKE FINDING GRIEVOUS OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY.

BAIL, ANAKIN, AND THE CROWD WALK AWAY FROM THE PLATFORM TOWARD THE SENATE BUILDING GRAND HALLWAY.

BAIL ORGANA: SKYWALKER, THE REPUBLIC CANNOT PRAISE YOU ENOUGH.

ANAKIN AND BAIL ORGANA, WALKING IN THE HALLWAY.

ANAKIN: THANK YOU, SENATOR ORGANA. THE KIDNAPPING WAS A BOLD MOVE BY THE SEPARATISTS, BUT IT WAS A MISTAKE THAT OBI-WAN AND I WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

ARTOO AND THREEPIO FOLLOW BEHIND THE CROWD.

C-3PO: IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE AS BAD AS ALL THAT.

ARTOO BEEPS.

C-3PO: (CONTINUING) WELL, THERE, I AGREE WITH YOU. IN FACT, I COULD DO WITH A TUNE-UP MYSELF.

70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON

ANAKIN IS AT THE BACK OF THE CROWD OF SENATORS, TALKING WITH BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 AND C-3PO SCOOT ALONG AHEAD OF THEM.

BAIL ORGANA: THE END OF COUNT DOOKU WILL SURELY BRING AN END TO THIS WAR, AND AN END TO THE CHANCELLOR'S DRACONIAN SECURITY MEASURES.

ANAKIN: I WISH THAT WERE SO, BUT THE FIGHTING IS GOING TO CONTINUE UNTIL GENERAL GRIEVOUS IS SPARE PARTS . . . THE CHANCELLOR IS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

BEHIND A ROW OF LARGE COLUMNS, A SHADOWY FIGURE FOLLOWS THE JEDI AND THE SENATOR. ANAKIN SENSES THE FIGURE.

BAIL ORGANA: I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN WITH THE SENATE.

ANAKIN: EXCUSE ME.

BAIL ORGANA: CERTAINLY.

ANAKIN STOPS, AND BAIL GOES OFF AFTER PALPATINE AND THE OTHERS. ANAKIN GOES BEHIND ONE OF THE GIANT COLUMNS TO MEET UP WITH THE SHADOWY FIGURE, WHO IS REVEALED TO BE SENATOR PADME AMDALA. THEY EMBRACE AND KISS.

PADME: OH, ANAKIN! THANK GOODNESS, YOU'RE BACK.

ANAKIN: I MISSED YOU, PADME. I'VE MISSED YOU SO.

PADME: THERE WERE WHISPERS . . . THAT YOU'D BEEN KILLED. I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH UNBEARABLE DREAD.

ANAKIN: I'M BACK, I'M ALL RIGHT. IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN APART FOR A LIFETIME. AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ... IF THE CHANCELLOR HADN'T BEEN KIDNAPPED. I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD HAVE EVER BROUGHT US BACK FROM THE OUTER RIM SIEGES.

ANAKIN STARTS TO GIVE HER ANOTHER KISS. SHE STEPS BACK.

PADME: WAIT, NOT HERE . . .

HE GRABS HER AGAIN.

ANAKIN: YES, HERE! I'M TIRED OF ALL THIS DECEPTION. I DON'T CARE IF THEY KNOW WE'RE MARRIED.

PADME: ANAKIN, DON'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU'RE IMPORTANT TO THE REPUBLIC ... TO ENDING THIS WAR. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING, BUT I WON'T LET YOU GIVE UP YOUR LIFE AS A JEDI FOR ME . . .

ANAKIN: I'VE GIVEN MY LIFE TO THE JEDI ORDER, BUT I'D ONLY GIVE UP MY LIFE, FOR YOU.

PADME: (PLAYFULLY) I WOULDN'T LIKE THAT. I WOULDN'T LIKE THAT ONE BIT. PATIENCE, MY HANDSOME JEDI . . . COME TO ME LATER.

ANAKIN EMBRACES HER, THEN LOOKS AT HER.

ANAKIN: ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE TREMBLING. WHAT'S GOING ON?

PADME: I'M JUST EXCITED TO SEE YOU.

ANAKIN: THAT'S NOT IT. I SENSE MORE . . . WHAT IS IT?

PADME: NOTHING . . . NOTHING . . .

ANAKIN: YOU'RE FRIGHTENED. (A LITTLE ANGRY) TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON!

PADME BEGINS TO CRY.

PADME: YOU'VE BEEN GONE FIVE MONTHS . . . IT'S BEEN VERY HARD FOR ME. I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALONE. THERE'S . . .

ANAKIN: . . . IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?

PADME: (PEEVED, ANGRY) NO! WHY DO YOU THINK THAT? YOUR JEALOUSY UPSETS ME SO MUCH, ANAKIN. I DO NOTHING TO BETRAY YOU, YET YOU STILL DON'T TRUST ME. NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

ANAKIN: (SHEEPISH) I'M AFRAID OF LOSING YOU, PADME . . . THAT'S ALL.

PADME: I WILL NEVER STOP LOVING YOU, ANAKIN. MY ONLY FEAR IS LOSING YOU.

ANAKIN: IT'S JUST THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THIS . . .

PADME: SOMETHING WONDERFUL HAS HAPPENED.

THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER FOR A LONG MOMENT.

PADME: (CONTINUING) I'M . . . ANNIE, I'M PREGNANT.

ANAKIN IS STUNNED. HE THINKS THROUGH ALL OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS. HE TAKES HER IN HIS ARMS.

ANAKIN: THAT'S . . . THAT'S WONDERFUL.

PADME: WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

ANAKIN: WE'RE NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT? THIS IS A HAPPY MOMENT. THE HAPPIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A SMALL NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE LANDS. BATTLE DROIDS SURROUND THE RAMP AS GENERAL GRIEVOUS DESCENDS ONTO THE PLATFORM. SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 APPROACHES.

SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: THE PLANET IS SECURE, SIR. THE POPULATION IS UNDER CONTROL.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: GOOD. WHERE IS THE SEPARATIST COUNCIL?

SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: THIS WAY, SIR ...

GENERAL GRIEVOUS TAKES THE ELEVATOR TO AN UPPER LEVEL. HE ENTERS A CONFERENCE ROOM AND PRESSES A SERIES OF BUTTONS ON THE TABLE, AND BOWS.

72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY

A HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS APPEARS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: YES, LORD SIDIOUS.

DARTH SLDIOUS: GENERAL GRIEVOUS, I SUGGEST YOU MOVE THE SEPARATIST LEADERS TO MUSTAFAR.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: IT WILL BE DONE, MY LORD.

DARTH SLDIOUS: THE END OF THE WAR IS NEAR, GENERAL, AND I PROMISE YOU, VICTORY IS ASSURED.

THE HOLOGRAM OF SIDIOUS TALKS TO GRIEVOUS ABOUT THE DEATH OF COUNT DOOKU.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: BUT THE LOSS OF COUNT DOOKU?

DARTH SLDIOUS: HIS DEATH WAS A NECESSARY LOSS, WHICH WILL ENSURE OUR VICTORY. SOON I WILL HAVE A NEW APPRENTICE . . . ONE FAR YOUNGER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN LORD TYRANUS.

73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT

PADME STANDS IN THE BALCONY BRUSHING HER HAIR. ANAKIN LEANS AGAINST THE WALL, WATCHING HER LOVINGLY.

ANAKIN: . . . EVERY SECOND I WAS THINKING OF YOU. PROTECTING THE ENDLESS, NAMELESS OUTER RIM SETTLEMENTS BECAME A TORTURE . . . THE BATTLES WERE EASY, THE LONGING BECAME UNBEARABLE . . . I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS I AM AT THIS MOMENT.

PADME: ANNIE, I WANT TO HAVE OUR BABY BACK HOME ON NABOO. WE COULD GO TO THE LAKE COUNTRY WHERE NO ONE WOULD KNOW . . . WHERE WE WOULD BE SAFE. I COULD GO EARLY-AND FIX UP THE BABY'S ROOM. I KNOW THE PERFECT SPOT, RIGHT BY THE GARDENS.

ANAKIN: YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!

PADME: IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I'M SO IN LOVE . . .

ANAKIN: NO, IT'S BECAUSE I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.

PADME: SO LOVE HAS BLINDED YOU?

ANAKIN: WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT . . .

PADME: BUT IT'S PROBABLY TRUE!

THEY LAUGH.

ANAKIN: I HAVEN'T LAUGHED IN SO LONG . . .

PADME: NEITHER HAVE I.

74 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM

THE VIEW IS STRANGELY DISTORTED AND DISORIENTING. PADME IS ON A TABLE IN AN ALIEN MEDICAL CHAMBER. SHE IS GIVING BIRTH AND IS SCREAMING.

PADME: ANAKIN, HELP ME! HELP, ANAKIN! ANAKIN, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU.

SHE SCREAMS AND DIES.

75 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT

ANAKIN AWAKENS IN A PANIC. HE IS COVERED IN SWEAT. HE LOOKS OVER IN THE BED AND SEES PADME SOUND ASLEEP NEXT TO HIM. ANAKIN GETS OUT FROM UNDER THE SHEETS AND SITS ON THE SIDE OF THE BED. HE IS BREATHING HEAVILY. HE PUTS HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND WEEPS. HE REGAINS HIS COMPOSURE AND LEAVES THE ROOM DOWN A SET OF STAIRS. PADME AWAKENS, REALIZES ANAKIN IS GONE.

PADME: ANAKIN??

SHE GETS OUT OF BED AND GOES DOWNSTAIRS TO LOOK FOR HIM.

76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT

ANAKIN WALKS DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS ONTO A LARGE VERANDA. THE VAST CITY PLANET OF CORUSCANT, SMOLDERING FROM THE BATTLE, IS SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM. HE IS DISTRAUGHT.
PADME DESCENDS THE STAIRS AND JOINS ANAKIN ON THE VERANDA. SHE TAKES HIS HAND. HE DOESN'T LOOK AT HER.

PADME: WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

ANAKIN: NOTHING . . .

ANAKIN TOUCHES THE JAPOR SNIPPET AROUND PADME'S NECK, THAT ANAKIN GAVE HER WHEN HE WAS A SMALL BOY.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) I REMEMBER WHEN I GAVE THIS TO YOU.

PADME: ANAKIN, HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR US TO BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER?

ANAKIN: IT WAS A DREAM.

PADME: BAD?

ANAKIN: LIKE THE ONES I USED TO HAVE ABOUT MY MOTHER JUST BEFORE SHE DIED.

PADME: AND?

ANAKIN: IT WAS ABOUT YOU.

THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER. A MOMENT OF CONCERN PASSES BETWEEN THEM.

PADME: TELL ME.

ANAKIN: IT WAS ONLY A DREAM.

PADME GIVES HIM A LONG, WORRIED LOOK. ANAKIN TAKES A DEEP BREATH.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) YOU DIE IN CHILDBIRTH . . .

PADME: AND THE BABY?

ANAKIN: I DON'T KNOW.

PADME: IT WAS ONLY A DREAM.

ANAKIN TAKES PADME IN HIS ARMS.

ANAKIN: . . . I WON'T LET THIS ONE BECOME REAL, PADME.

THEY EMBRACE, THEN PART.

PADME: ANAKIN, THIS BABY WILL CHANGE OUR LIVES. I DOUBT THE QUEEN WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW ME TO SERVE IN THE SENATE, AND IF THE COUNCIL DISCOVERS YOU ARE THE FATHER, YOU WILL BE EXPELLED FROM THE JEDI ORDER.

ANAKIN: I KNOW �.

PADME: ANAKIN, DO YOU THINK OBI-WAN MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP US?

ANAKIN: (SUSPICIOUS) HAVE YOU TOLD HIM ANYTHING?

PADME: NO, BUT HE'S YOUR MENTOR, YOUR BEST FRIEND . . . HE MUST SUSPECT SOMETHING.

ANAKIN: HE'S BEEN A FATHER TO ME, BUT HE'S STILL ON THE COUNCIL. DON'T TELL HIM ANYTHING!

PADME: I WON'T, ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: I DON'T NEED HIS HELP . . . OUR BABY IS A BLESSING, NOT A PROBLEM.

77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY

YODA AND ANAKIN SIT IN YODA 'S ROOM, DEEP IN THOUGHT.

YODA: PREMONITIONS . . . PREMONITIONS . . . HMMMM . . . THESE VISIONS YOU HAVE . . .

ANAKIN: THEY ARE OF PAIN, SUFFERING, DEATH . . .

YODA: YOURSELF YOU SPEAK OF, OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW?

ANAKIN: SOMEONE . . .

YODA: . . . CLOSE TO YOU?

ANAKIN: YES.

YODA: CAREFUL YOU MUST BE WHEN SENSING THE FUTURE, ANAKIN. THE FEAR OF LOSS IS A PATH TO THE DARK SIDE.

ANAKIN: I WON'T LET THESE VISIONS COME TRUE, MASTER YODA.

YODA: DEATH IS A NATURAL PART OF LIFE. REJOICE FOR THOSE AROUND YOU WHO TRANSFORM INTO THE FORCE. MOURN THEM, DO NOT. MISS THEM, DO NOT. ATTACHMENT LEADS TO JEALOUSY. THE SHADOW OF GREED, THAT IS.

ANAKIN: WHAT MUST I DO, MASTER YODA?

YODA: TRAIN YOURSELF TO LET GO OF EVERYTHING YOU FEAR TO LOSE.

78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY

ANAKIN HURRIES DOWN A TEMPLE HALLWAY, HEADING TOWARD A JEDI BRIEFING ROOM. SEVERAL JEDI ARE EXITING.

79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY

ANAKIN RUSHES INTO THE BRIEFING ROOM. BY THE TIME HE REACHES THE CHAMBER, THE LAST OF THE JEDI ARE LEAVING. ONLY OBI-WAN REMAINS AT THE FRONT OF THE LECTURE HALL. HE IS SHUTTING OFF SOME HOLOGRAMS AND ELECTRONIC CHARTS AND MAPS.

OBI-WAN: YOU MISSED THE REPORT ON THE OUTER RIM SIEGES.

ANAKIN: I'M SORRY, I WAS HELD UP. I HAVE NO EXCUSE.

OBI-WAN: IN SHORT, THEY ARE GOING VERY WELL. SALEUCAMI HAS FALLEN, AND MASTER VOS HAS MOVED HIS TROOPS TO BOZ PITY.

ANAKIN: WHAT'S WRONG THEN?

OBI-WAN: THE SENATE IS EXPECTED TO VOTE MORE EXECUTIVE POWERS TO THE CHANCELLOR TODAY.

ANAKIN: WELL, THAT CAN ONLY MEAN LESS DELIBERATING AND MORE ACTION. IS THAT BAD? IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO END THIS WAR.

OBI-WAN: ANAKIN, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR FRIEND PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: BE CAREFUL OF WHAT?

OBI-WAN: HE HAS REQUESTED YOUR PRESENCE.

ANAKIN: WHAT FOR?

OBI-WAN: HE WOULD NOT SAY.

ANAKIN: HE DIDN'T INFORM THE JEDI COUNCIL? THAT'S UNUSUAL, ISN'T IT?

OBI-WAN: ALL OF THIS IS UNUSUAL, AND IT'S MAKING ME FEEL UNEASY. YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COUNCIL AND THE CHANCELLOR ARE STRESSED.

ANAKIN: I KNOW THE COUNCIL HAS GROWN WARY OF THE CHANCELLOR'S POWER, MINE ALSO FOR THAT MATTER. AREN'T WE ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO SAVE THE REPUBLIC? WHY ALL THIS DISTRUST?

OBI-WAN: THE FORCE GROWS DARK, ANAKIN, AND WE ARE ALL AFFECTED BY IT. BE WARY OF YOUR FEELINGS.

80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY

ANAKIN STANDS WITH PALPATINE AT HIS WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE VASTNESS OF CORUSCANT. SEVERAL BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. A BROWN HAZE HANGS OVER THE LANDSCAPE.

PALPATINE: ANAKIN, THIS AFTERNOON THE SENATE IS GOING TO CALL ON ME TO TAKE DIRECT CONTROL OF THE JEDI COUNCIL.

ANAKIN: THE JEDI WILL NO LONGER REPORT TO THE SENATE?

PALPATINE: THEY WILL REPORT TO ME . . . PERSONALLY. THE SENATE IS TOO UNFOCUSED TO CONDUCT A WAR. THIS WILL BRING A QUICK END TO THINGS.

ANAKIN: I AGREE, BUT THE JEDI COUNCIL MAY NOT SEE IT THAT WAY.

PALPATINE: THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE MUST ALL ENDURE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION IN THE NAME OF SECURITY.

ANAKIN: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR, THE COUNCIL IS IN NO MOOD FOR MORE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.

PALPATINE: THANK YOU, MY FRIEND, BUT IN THIS CASE I HAVE NO CHOICE . . . THIS WAR MUST BE WON.

ANAKIN: EVERYONE WILL AGREE ON THAT.

PALPATINE: ANAKIN, I'VE KNOWN YOU SINCE YOU WERE A SMALL BOY. I HAVE ADVISED YOU OVER THE YEARS WHEN I COULD ... I AM VERY PROUD OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS. YOU HAVE WON MANY BATTLES THE JEDI COUNCIL THOUGHT WERE LOST . . . AND YOU SAVED MY LIFE. I HOPE YOU TRUST ME, ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: OF COURSE.

PALPATINE: I NEED YOUR HELP, SON.

ANAKIN: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

PALPATINE: I FEAR THE JEDI. THE COUNCIL KEEPS PUSHING FOR MORE CONTROL. THEY'RE SHROUDED IN SECRECY AND OBSESSED WITH MAINTAINING THEIR AUTONOMY . . . IDEALS. I FIND SIMPLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE IN A DEMOCRACY.

ANAKIN: I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE JEDI ARE DEDICATED TO THE VALUES OF THE REPUBLIC, SIR.

PALPATINE: NEVERTHELESS, THEIR ACTIONS WILL SPEAK MORE LOUDLY THAN THEIR WORDS. I'M DEPENDING ON YOU.

ANAKIN: FOR WHAT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

PALPATINE: TO BE THE EYES, EARS, AND VOICE OF THE REPUBLIC . . .

ANAKIN THINKS ABOUT THIS.

PALPATINE: (CONTINUING) ANAKIN . . . I'M APPOINTING YOU TO BE MY PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE ON THE JEDI COUNCIL.

ANAKIN: ME? A MASTER? I AM OVERWHELMED, SIR, BUT THE COUNCIL ELECTS ITS OWN MEMBERS. THEY WILL NEVER ACCEPT THIS.

PALPATINE: I THINK THEY WILL . . . THEY NEED YOU MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S OFFICE-DAY

PADME, BAIL ORGANA, AND SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, AND GIDDEAN DANU SIT IN SENATOR ORGANA 'S OFFICE.

BAIL ORGANA: NOW THAT HE HAS CONTROL OF THE JEDI COUNCIL, THE CHANCELLOR HAS APPOINTED GOVERNORS TO OVERSEE ALL STAR SYSTEMS IN THE REPUBLIC.

FANG ZAR: WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

BAIL ORGANA: THE DECREE WAS POSTED THIS MORNING.

PADME: DO YOU THINK HE WILL DISMANTLE THE SENATE?

MON MOTHMA: WHY BOTHER? AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, THE SENATE NO LONGER EXISTS.

GIDDEAN DANU: THE CONSTITUTION IS IN SHREDS. AMENDMENT AFTER AMENDMENT . . . EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVES, SOMETIMES A DOZEN IN ONE DAY.

BAIL ORGANA: WE CAN'T LET A THOUSAND YEARS OF DEMOCRACY DISAPPEAR WITHOUT A FIGHT.

EVERYONE LOOKS AT EACH OTHER, A LITTLE WORRIED AT THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT WAS JUST SAID.

TERR TANEEL: WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

BAIL ORGANA: I APOLOGIZE. I DIDN'T MEAN TO SOUND LIKE A SEPARATIST.

MON MOTHMA: WE ARE NOT SEPARATISTS TRYING TO LEAVE THE REPUBLIC. WE ARE LOYALISTS, TRYING TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY IN THE REPUBLIC.

BAIL ORGANA: IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR TO MANY OF US THAT THE CHANCELLOR HAS BECOME AN ENEMY OF DEMOCRACY.

PADME: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT HAS COME TO THIS! CHANCELLOR PALPATINE IS ONE OF MY OLDEST ADVISORS. HE SERVED AS MY AMBASSADOR WHEN I WAS QUEEN.

GLDDEAN DANU: SENATOR, I FEAR YOU UNDERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF CORRUPTION THAT HAS TAKEN HOLD IN THE SENATE.

MON MOTHMA: THE CHANCELLOR HAS PLAYED THE SENATORS WELL. THEY KNOW WHERE THE POWER LIES, AND THEY WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SHARE IN IT. PALPATINE HAS BECOME A DICTATOR AND WE HAVE HELPED HIM TO DO IT.

BAIL ORGANA: WE CAN'T SIT AROUND DEBATING ANY LONGER, WE HAVE DECIDED TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO STOP IT. SENATOR MON MOTHMA AND I ARE PUTTING TOGETHER AN ORGANIZATION . . .

PADME: SAY NO MORE. SENATOR ORGANA. I UNDERSTAND. AT THIS POINT, IT'S BETTER TO LEAVE SOME THINGS UNSAID.

BAIL ORGANA: YES. I AGREE AND WE MUST NOT DISCUSS THIS WITH ANYONE, WITHOUT EVERYONE IN THIS GROUP AGREEING.

MON MOTHMA: THAT MEANS THOSE CLOSEST TO YOU . . . EVEN FAMILY ... NO ONE CAN BE TOLD.

THEY ALL NOD THEIR HEADS. PADME CONSIDERS THIS FOR A MOMENT.

PADME: AGREED.

82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY

ANAKIN STANDS PENSIVELY IN FRONT OF THE JEDI COUNCIL CHAMBERS. THE DOOR OPENS.

83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY

ANAKIN ENTERS AND STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. HE IS SURROUNDED BY THE JEDI COUNCIL MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, THE HOLOGRAMS OF PLO KOON AND KI-ADI-MUNDI.

MACE: ANAKIN SKYWALKER, WE HAVE APPROVED YOUR APPOINTMENT TO THE COUNCIL AS THE CHANCELLOR'S PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE.

ANAKIN: I WILL DO MY BEST TO UPHOLD THE PRINCIPLES OF THE JEDI ORDER.

YODA: ALLOW THIS APPOINTMENT LIGHTLY, THE COUNCIL DOES NOT. DISTURBING IS THIS MOVE BY CHANCELLOR PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: I UNDERSTAND.

MACE: YOU ARE ON THIS COUNCIL, BUT WE DO NOT GRANT YOU THE RANK OF MASTER.

ANAKIN REACTS WITH ANGER.

ANAKIN: WHAT? ! HOW CAN YOU DO THIS?? THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS, IT'S UNFAIR . . . I'M MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY OF YOU. HOW CAN YOU BE ON THE COUNCIL AND NOT BE A MASTER?

MACE: TAKE A SEAT, YOUNG SKYWALKER.

ANAKIN: FORGIVE ME, MASTER.

ANAKIN GOES AND SITS IN ONE OF THE EMPTY CHAIRS. EVERYONE IS EMBARRASSED. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, SPEAKS.

KL-ADI-MUNDI: WE HAVE SURVEYED ALL SYSTEMS IN THE REPUBLIC, AND HAVE FOUND NO SIGN OF GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

YODA: HIDING IN THE OUTER RIM, GRIEVOUS IS. THE OUTLYING SYSTEMS, YOU MUST SWEEP.

OBI-WAN: IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME . . . WE DO NOT HAVE MANY SHIPS TO SPARE.

MACE: WE CANNOT TAKE SHIPS FROM THE FRONT LINE.

OBI-WAN: AND YET, IT WOULD BE FATAL FOR US TO ALLOW THE DROID ARMIES TO REGROUP.

YODA: MASTER KENOBI, OUR SPIES CONTACT, YOU MUST, AND THEN WAIT.

KL-ADI-MUNDI: WHAT ABOUT THE DROID ATTACK ON THE WOOKIEES?

MACE: IT IS CRITICAL WE SEND AN ATTACK GROUP THERE, IMMEDIATELY!

OBI-WAN: HE'S RIGHT, THAT IS A SYSTEM WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE. IT'S THE MAIN NAVIGATION ROUTE FOR THE SOUTHWESTERN QUADRANT.

ANAKIN: I KNOW THAT SYSTEM WELL. IT WOULD TAKE US LITTLE TIME TO DRIVE THE DROIDS OFF THAT PLANET.

MACE: SKYWALKER, YOUR ASSIGNMENT IS HERE WITH THE CHANCELLOR, AND KENOBI MUST FIND GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

YODA: GO, I WILL. GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE WOOKIEES, I HAVE.

MACE: IT IS SETTLED THEN. YODA WILL TAKE A BATTALION OF CLONES TO REINFORCE THE WOOKIEES ON KASHYYYK. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH US ALL.

ANAKIN IS DISAPPOINTED.

84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON

ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN WALK THROUGH ONE OF THE MASSIVE JEDI TEMPLE HALLWAYS. ANAKIN IS FURIOUS.

ANAKIN: WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE IS THIS, PUT ME ON THE COUNCIL AND NOT MAKE ME A MASTER!?? THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE JEDI. IT'S INSULTING!

OBI-WAN: CALM DOWN, ANAKIN. YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN A GREAT HONOR. TO BE ON THE COUNCIL AT YOUR AGE . . . IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. LISTEN TO ME, ANAKIN. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO THE CHANCELLOR. THE COUNCIL DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN HE INTERFERES IN JEDI AFFAIRS.

ANAKIN: I SWEAR TO YOU, I DIDN'T ASK TO BE PUT ON THE COUNCIL . . .

OBI-WAN: BUT IT'S WHAT YOU WANTED! YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH CHANCELLOR PALPATINE SEEMS TO HAVE PAID OFF.

ANAKIN: THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

OBI-WAN: ANAKIN, REGARDLESS OF HOW IT HAPPENED, YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A DELICATE SITUATION.

ANAKIN: YOU MEAN DIVIDED LOYALTIES.

OBI-WAN: I WARNED YOU THERE WAS TENSION BETWEEN THE COUNCIL AND THE CHANCELLOR. I WAS VERY CLEAR. WHY DIDN'T YOU LISTEN? YOU WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.

ANAKIN: THE COUNCIL IS UPSET I'M THE YOUNGEST TO EVER SERVE.

OBI-WAN: NO, IT IS NOT. ANAKIN, I WORRY WHEN YOU SPEAK OF JEALOUSY AND PRIDE. THOSE ARE NOT JEDI THOUGHTS. THEY'RE DANGEROUS, DARK THOUGHTS.

ANAKIN: MASTER, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY ABILITIES. I KNOW WHERE MY LOYALTIES LIE.

OBI-WAN: I HOPE SO . . .

ANAKIN: I SENSE THERE'S MORE TO THIS TALK THAN YOU'RE SAYING.

OBI-WAN: ANAKIN, THE ONLY REASON THE COUNCIL HAS APPROVED YOUR APPOINTMENT IS BECAUSE THE CHANCELLOR TRUSTS YOU.

ANAKIN: AND?

OBI-WAN: ANAKIN, LOOK, I AM ON YOUR SIDE. I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE YOU PUT IN THIS SITUATION.

ANAKIN: WHAT SITUATION?

OBI-WAN: (TAKES A DEEP BREATH) THE COUNCIL WANTS YOU TO REPORT ON ALL OF THE CHANCELLOR'S DEALINGS. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE'S UP TO.

ANAKIN: THEY WANT ME TO SPY ON THE CHANCELLOR? THAT'S TREASON!

OBI-WAN: WE ARE AT WAR, ANAKIN. THE JEDI COUNCIL IS SWORN TO UPHOLD THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REPUBLIC, EVEN IF THE CHANCELLOR DOES NOT.

ANAKIN: WHY DIDN'T THE COUNCIL GIVE ME THIS ASSIGNMENT WHEN WE WERE IN SESSION?

OBI-WAN: THIS ASSIGNMENT IS NOT TO BE ON RECORD. THE COUNCIL ASKED ME TO APPROACH YOU ON THIS PERSONALLY.

ANAKIN: THE CHANCELLOR IS NOT A BAD MAN, OBI-WAN. HE BEFRIENDED ME. HE'S WATCHED OUT FOR ME EVER SINCE I ARRIVED HERE.

OBI-WAN: THAT IS WHY YOU MUST HELP US, ANAKIN. OUR ALLEGIANCE IS TO THE SENATE, NOT TO ITS LEADER WHO HAS MANAGED TO STAY IN OFFICE LONG AFTER HIS TERM HAS EXPIRED.

ANAKIN: MASTER, THE SENATE DEMANDED THAT HE STAY LONGER.

OBI-WAN: YES, BUT USE YOUR FEELINGS, ANAKIN. SOMETHING IS OUT OF PLACE.

ANAKIN: YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO SOMETHING AGAINST THE JEDI CODE. AGAINST THE REPUBLIC. AGAINST A MENTOR . . . AND A FRIEND. THAT'S WHAT'S OUT OF PLACE HERE. WHY ARE YOU ASKING THIS OF ME?

OBI-WAN: THE COUNCIL IS ASKING YOU.

85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A JEDI GUNSHIP HEADS FOR THE HUGE CLONE LANDING PLATFORM.

86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY

YODA, MACE, AND OBI-WAN RIDE IN THE GUNSHIP AS IT HEADS FOR THE CLONE LANDING PLATFORM. MACE AND OBI-WAN ARE SITTING.

OBI-WAN : ANAKIN DID NOT TAKE TO HIS ASSIGNMENT WITH MUCH ENTHUSIASM.

YODA: TOO MUCH UNDER THE SWAY OF THE CHANCELLOR, HE IS. MUCH ANGER THERE IS IN HIM. TOO MUCH PRIDE IN HIS POWERS.

MACE: IT'S VERY DANGEROUS, PUTTING THEM TOGETHER. I DON'T THINK THE BOY CAN HANDLE IT. I DON'T TRUST HIM.

OBI-WAN: HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. I TRUST HIM WITH MY LIFE.

MACE:I WISH I DID.

OBI-WAN: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MASTER, IS HE NOT THE CHOSEN ONE? IS HE NOT TO DESTROY THE SITH AND BRING BALANCE TO THE FORCE?

MACE: SO THE PROPHECY SAYS.

YODA: A PROPHECY . . . THAT MISREAD COULD HAVE BEEN.

OBI-WAN: HE WILL NOT LET ME DOWN. HE NEVER HAS.

YODA: I HOPE RIGHT YOU ARE. AND NOW DESTROY THE DROID ARMIES ON KASHYYYK, I WILL. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.

THE GUNSHIP LANDS AND THE RAMP LOWERS. YODA EXITS THE GUNSHIP. MACE AND OBI-WAN STAND AND GIVE HIM A BRIEF BOW THEN TAKE OFF IN THE GUNSHIP.

87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET

PADME'S SPEEDER PULLS UP TO THE LANDING PLATFORM. CAPTAIN TYPHO ESCORTS PADME ONTO THE VERANDA, WHERE TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE AND MOTEE) ARE WAITING. PADME TURNS TO CAPTAIN TYPHO.

PADME: THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: REST WELL. MY LADY.

CAPTAIN TYPHO GETS BACK INTO THE SPEEDER, AND IT DISAPPEARS INTO THE CITYSCAPE. THE HANDMAIDENS, MOTEE AND ELLE, APPROACH PADME AS THE SHADOW OF A FIGURE MOVES IN THE BACKGROUND. C-3PO IS STANDING NEARBY.

PADME: I'LL BE UP IN A WHILE.

MOTEE: YES, MY LADY.

C-3PO STANDS, CONFUSED, AS THE HANDMAIDENS TURN AND EXIT.

C-3PO: IS THERE ANYTHING I MIGHT DO FOR YOU, MY LADY?

PADME: YES, MAKE SURE ALL THE SECURITY DROIDS ARE WORKING. THANK YOU, THREEPIO.

THE GOLDEN DROID TURNS AND EXITS.

PADME STANDS AND WATCHES THE SUNSET. THE SHADOWY FIGURE MOVES TOWARD HER. SHE SENSES SOMETHING.

ANAKIN: BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT?

PADME JUMPS AND TURNS AROUND.

PADME: YOU STARTLED ME.

HE SITS NEXT TO HER ON THE BENCH.

ANAKIN: HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

PADME: HE KEEPS KICKING.

ANAKIN: HE?! WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S A BOY?

PADME: (LAUGHS) MY MOTHERLY INTUITION.

SHE PUTS HIS HAND ON HER BELLY.

ANAKIN: WHOA! WITH A KICK THAT STRONG, IT'S GOT TO BE A GIRL.

THEY LAUGH.

PADME: I HEARD ABOUT YOUR APPOINTMENT. ANAKIN. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

ANAKIN: I MAY BE ON THE COUNCIL, BUT . . . THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT ME AS A JEDI MASTER.

PADME: PATIENCE. IN TIME, THEY WILL RECOGNIZE YOUR SKILLS.

ANAKIN: THEY STILL TREAT ME AS IF I WERE A PADAWAN LEARNER. . . THEY FEAR MY POWER, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

PADME: ANAKIN . . .

ANAKIN: SOMETIMES, I WONDER WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE JEDI ORDER . . . I THINK THIS WAR IS DESTROYING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REPUBLIC.

PADME: HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THAT WE MAY BE ON THE WRONG SIDE?

ANAKIN: (SUSPICIOUS) WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

PADME: WHAT IF THE DEMOCRACY WE THOUGHT WE WERE SERVING NO LONGER EXISTS, AND THE REPUBLIC HAS BECOME THE VERY EVIL WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO DESTROY?

ANAKIN: I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. AND YOU'RE SOUNDING LIKE A SEPARATIST!

PADME: ANAKIN, THIS WAR REPRESENTS A FAILURE TO LISTEN . . . NOW, YOU'RE CLOSER TO THE CHANCELLOR THAN ANYONE. PLEASE, PLEASE ASK HIM TO STOP THE FIGHTING AND LET DIPLOMACY RESUME.

ANAKIN: (GROWING ANGRY) DON'T ASK ME TO DO THAT, PADME. MAKE A MOTION IN THE SENATE, WHERE THAT KIND OF A REQUEST BELONGS. I'M NOT YOUR ERRAND BOY. I'M NOT ANYONE'S ERRAND BOY!

PADME: WHAT IS IT?

ANAKIN: NOTHING.

PADME: DON'T DO THIS . . . DON'T SHUT ME OUT. LET ME HELP YOU.

ANAKIN: YOU CAN'T HELP ME . . . I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

THEY LOOK IN EACH OTHER'S EYES.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) I SENSE . . . THERE ARE THINGS YOU ARE NOT TELLING ME.

PADME IS STARTLED AT THIS.

PADME: I SENSE THERE ARE THINGS YOU ARE NOT TELLING ME.

PADME SMILES. ANAKIN IS A LITTLE EMBARRASSED.

PADME: (CONTINUING) HOLD ME . . . LIKE YOU DID BY THE LAKE ON NABOO, SO LONG AGO . . . WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING BUT OUR LOVE ... NO POLITICS, NO PLOTTING ... NO WAR.

88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT

ANAKIN LANDS HIS SPEEDER AND EXITS.
ANAKIN RUNS UP THE STAIRS AT THE GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE.
ANAKIN RUNS THROUGH THE HALLWAY AND ENTERS PALPATINE'S BOX, WHERE THE CHANCELLOR IS SITTING WITH MAS AMEDDA AND SLY-MOORE, WATCHING THE MAN CALAMARI BALLET DOING "SQUID LAKE."

ANAKIN: YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, CHANCELLOR.

PALPATINE: YES, ANAKIN! COME CLOSER. I HAVE GOOD NEWS. OUR CLONE INTELLIGENCE UNITS HAVE DISCOVERED THE LOCATION OF GENERAL GRIEVOUS. HE IS HIDING IN THE UTAPAU SYSTEM.

ANAKIN: AT LAST, WE'LL BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THAT MONSTER AND END THIS WAR.

PALPATINE: I WOULD WORRY ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE WISDOM OF THE COUNCIL IF THEY DIDN'T SELECT YOU FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT. YOU ARE THE BEST CHOICE BY FAR � BUT, THEY CAN'T ALWAYS BE TRUSTED TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

ANAKIN: THEY TRY.

PALPATINE: SIT DOWN, (TO HIS AIDES) LEAVE US.

ANAKIN SITS NEXT TO PALPATINE. THE CHANCELLOR LEANS OVER TO HIM.

PALPATINE: (CONTINUING) ANAKIN, YOU KNOW I'M NOT ABLE TO RELY ON THE JEDI COUNCIL. IF THEY HAVEN'T INCLUDED YOU IN THEIR PLOT, THEY SOON WILL.

ANAKIN: I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND.

PALPATINE: YOU MUST SENSE WHAT I HAVE COME TO SUSPECT . . . THE JEDI COUNCIL WANT CONTROL OF THE REPUBLIC . . . THEY'RE PLANNING TO BETRAY ME.

ANAKIN: I DON'T THINK . . .

PALPATINE: ANAKIN, SEARCH YOUR FEELINGS. YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?

ANAKIN: I KNOW THEY DON'T TRUST YOU . . .

PALPATINE: OR THE SENATE . . . OR THE REPUBLIC . . . OR DEMOCRACY FOR THAT MATTER.

ANAKIN: I HAVE TO ADMIT MY TRUST IN THEM HAS BEEN SHAKEN.

PALPATINE: WHY? THEY ASKED YOU TO DO SOMETHING THAT MADE YOU FEEL DISHONEST, DIDN'T THEY?

ANAKIN DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING. HE SIMPLY LOOKS DOWN.

PALPATINE: (CONTINUING) THEY ASKED YOU TO SPY ON ME, DIDN'T THEY?

ANAKIN: I DON'T KNOW ... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

PALPATINE: REMEMBER BACK TO YOUR EARLY TEACHINGS. ANAKIN. "ALL THOSE WHO GAIN POWER ARE AFRAID TO LOSE IT." EVEN THE JEDI.

ANAKIN: THE JEDI USE THEIR POWER FOR GOOD.

PALPATINE: GOOD IS A POINT OF VIEW, ANAKIN. AND THE JEDI POINT OF VIEW IS NOT THE ONLY VALID ONE. THE DARK LORDS OF THE SITH BELIEVE IN SECURITY AND JUSTICE ALSO, YET THEY ARE CONSIDERED BY THE JEDI TO BE. . .

ANAKIN: . . . EVIL.

PALPATINE: . . . FROM A JEDI'S POINT OF VIEW. THE SITH AND THE JEDI ARE SIMILAR IN ALMOST EVERY WAY, INCLUDING THEIR QUEST FOR GREATER POWER. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE SITH ARE NOT AFRAID OF THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE. THAT IS WHY THEY ARE MORE POWERFUL.

ANAKIN: THE SITH RELY ON THEIR PASSION FOR THEIR STRENGTH. THEY THINK INWARD, ONLY ABOUT THEMSELVES.

PALPATINE: AND THE JEDI DON'T?

ANAKIN: THE JEDI ARE SELFLESS . . . THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT OTHERS.

PALPATINE SMILES.

PALPATINE: OR SO YOU'VE BEEN TRAINED TO BELIEVE. WHY IS IT, THEN, THAT THEY HAVE ASKED YOU TO DO SOMETHING YOU FEEL IS WRONG?

ANAKIN: I'M NOT SURE IT'S WRONG.

PALPATINE: HAVE THEY ASKED YOU TO BETRAY THE JEDI CODE? THE CONSTITUTION? A FRIENDSHIP? YOUR OWN VALUES? THINK. CONSIDER THEIR MOTIVES. KEEP YOUR MIND CLEAR OF ASSUMPTIONS. THE FEAR OF LOSING POWER IS A WEAKNESS OF BOTH THE JEDI AND THE SITH.

ANAKIN IS DEEP IN THOUGHT.

PALPATINE: (CONTINUING) DID YOU EVER HEAR THE TRAGEDY OF DARTH PLAGUEIS "THE WISE"?

ANAKIN: NO.

PALPATINE: I THOUGHT NOT. IT'S NOT A STORY THE JEDI WOULD TELL YOU. IT'S A SITH LEGEND. DARTH PLAGUEIS WAS A DARK LORD OF THE SITH, SO POWERFUL AND SO WISE HE COULD USE THE FORCE TO INFLUENCE THE MIDI-CHLORIANS TO CREATE LIFE ... HE HAD SUCH A KNOWLEDGE OF THE DARK SIDE THAT HE COULD EVEN KEEP THE ONES HE CARED ABOUT FROM DYING.

ANAKIN: HE COULD ACTUALLY SAVE PEOPLE FROM DEATH?

PALPATINE: THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE IS A PATHWAY TO MANY ABILITIES SOME CONSIDER TO BE UNNATURAL.

ANAKIN: WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

PALPATINE: HE BECAME SO POWERFUL . . . THE ONLY THING HE WAS AFRAID OF WAS LOSING HIS POWER, WHICH EVENTUALLY, OF COURSE, HE DID. UNFORTUNATELY, HE TAUGHT HIS APPRENTICE EVERYTHING HE KNEW, THEN HIS APPRENTICE KILLED HIM IN HIS SLEEP. (SMILES) PLAGUEIS NEVER SAW IT COMING. IT'S IRONIC HE COULD SAVE OTHERS FROM DEATH, BUT NOT HIMSELF.

ANAKIN: IS IT POSSIBLE TO LEARN THIS POWER?

PALPATINE: NOT FROM A JEDI.

89 EXT. KASHYYYK-DAY

A WOOKIEE CATAMARAN FLANKED BY WOOKIEE HELICOPTERS APPROACHES THE TREE HOUSING THE HOLOGRAM AREA.

90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY

YODA AND VARIOUS JEDI SPEAK VIA HOLOGRAM. THE DISCUSSION INCLUDES OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI AND PLO KOON.

KL-ADI-MUNDI: (HOLO) PALPATINE THINKS GENERAL GRIEVOUS IS ON UTAPAU. WE HAVE HAD NO REPORTS OF THIS FROM OUR AGENTS.

MACE: (HOLO) HOW COULD THE CHANCELLOR HAVE COME BY THIS INFORMATION AND WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT? WE HAVE HAD CONTACT WITH BARON PAPANOIDA AND HE SAID NO ONE WAS THERE.

ANAKIN: A PARTIAL MESSAGE WAS INTERCEPTED IN A DIPLOMATIC PACKET FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF UTAPAU.

YODA: ACT ON THIS, WE MUST. THE CAPTURE OF GENERAL GRIEVOUS WILL END THIS WAR. QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY WE SHOULD PROCEED.

OBI-WAN: DOES EVERYONE AGREE?

ALL THE JEDI CONCUR.

ANAKIN: THE CHANCELLOR HAS REQUESTED THAT I LEAD THE CAMPAIGN.

THEY ALL LOOK AT ANAKIN A BIT DISTURBED.

MACE: (A LITTLE PEEVED) THE COUNCIL WILL MAKE UP ITS OWN MIND WHO IS TO GO, NOT THE CHANCELLOR.

KL-ADI-MUNDI: YES, THIS DECISION IS OURS TO MAKE.

ANAKIN IS EMBARRASSED AND BECOMES SULLEN.

YODA: A MASTER IS NEEDED, WITH MORE EXPERIENCE.

MACE: GIVEN OUR RESOURCES, I RECOMMEND WE SEND ONLY ONE JEDI . . . MASTER KENOBI.

ANAKIN: HE WAS NOT SO SUCCESSFUL THE LAST TIME HE MET GRIEVOUS.

OBI-WAN THROWS ANAKIN A DIRTY LOOK.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) NO OFFENSE, MY MASTER, BUT I'M ONLY STATING A FACT.

OBI-WAN: OH NO, YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT, BUT I DO HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE WITH HIS WAYS OF COMBAT.

YODA: OBI-WAN, MY CHOICE IS.

KL-ADI-MUNDI: I CONCUR. MASTER KENOBI SHOULD GO.

YODA: I AGREE.

ALL THE JEDI CONCUR.

MACE: VERY WELL. COUNCIL IS ADJOURNED.

ANAKIN IS ANGRY.

MACE: (CONTINUING) OBI-WAN, PREPARE TWO CLONE BRIGADES AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN. IF THIS REPORT IS TRUE, THERE'S NO TELLING HOW MANY BATTLE DROIDS HE MAY HAVE WITH HIM.

91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY

YODA GETS OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND WALKS TO THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: THE DROIDS HAVE STARTED UP THEIR MAIN POWER GENERATORS.

YODA: THEN NOW THE TIME IS, COMMANDER.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: YES, SIR.

THE BATTLE BEGINS.

92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY

A WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN LETS OUT A ROAR AS THE WOOKIEE ARMY RUSHES TO FACE THE DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS RACE ACROSS THE WATER AGAINST THE WOOKIEES AND CLONE TROOPERS ON THE BEACH. DROID GUNSHIPS PROVIDE AIR SUPPORT, WHILE A SPIDER DROID EMERGES FROM THE WATERY DEPTHS. A BRAVE WOOKIEE PLACES AN EXPLOSIVE ON A SEPARATIST TANK AND JUMPS OFF JUST BEFORE THE TANK EXPLODES. FROM THE HOLOGRAM AREA, YODA OBSERVES THE ONGOING BATTLE.

93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING

PADME'S APARTMENT BUILDING IS SURROUNDED BY THE SMOG-SHROUDED CITY OF CORUSCANT.

94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING

PADME AND OBI-WAN SIT ON ONE OF THE COUCHES.

OBI-WAN: HAS ANAKIN BEEN TO SEE YOU?

PADME: SEVERAL TIMES . . . I WAS SO HAPPY TO HEAR HE WAS ACCEPTED ON THE JEDI COUNCIL.

OBI-WAN: I KNOW ... HE DESERVES IT. HE IS IMPATIENT, STRONG WILLED, VERY OPINIONATED, BUT TRULY GIFTED.

THEY LAUGH.

PADME: YOU'RE NOT JUST HERE TO SAY HELLO. SOMETHING IS WRONG, ISN'T IT?

OBI-WAN: YOU SHOULD BE A JEDI, PADME.

PADME: YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT HIDING YOUR FEELINGS.

OBI-WAN: IT'S ANAKIN . . . HE'S BECOMING MOODY AND DETACHED. HE'S BEEN PUT IN A DIFFICULT POSITION AS THE CHANCELLOR'S REPRESENTATIVE . . . BUT I THINK IT'S MORE THAN THAT. I WAS HOPING HE MAY HAVE TALKED TO YOU.

PADME: WHY WOULD HE TALK TO ME ABOUT HIS WORK?

OBI-WAN STUDIES HER.

OBI-WAN: NEITHER OF YOU IS VERY GOOD AT HIDING YOUR FEELINGS EITHER.

PADME: DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

OBI-WAN: I KNOW HOW HE FEELS ABOUT YOU.

PADME: (NERVOUS) WHAT DID HE SAY?

OBI-WAN: NOTHING. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

PADME IS A LITTLE FLUSTERED. SHE STANDS AND OBI-WAN FOLLOWS. SHE WALKS TO THE BALCONY.

PADME: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

OBI-WAN: I KNOW YOU BOTH TOO WELL. I CAN SEE YOU TWO ARE IN LOVE. PADME, I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

PADME LOOKS DOWN AND DOESN'T ANSWER.

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) I FEAR YOUR RELATIONSHIP HAS CONFUSED HIM. HE'S CHANGED CONSIDERABLY SINCE WE RETURNED . . .

THEY STAND ON THE BALCONY AND LOOK OFF AT THE EARLY MORNING CITY. OBI-WAN STARTS TO LEAVE. PADME STAYS LOOKING OFF INTO THE DISTANT CITY.

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) PADME, I'M NOT TELLING THE COUNCIL ABOUT ANY OF THIS. I ... I HOPE I DIDN'T UPSET YOU. WE'RE ALL FRIENDS, I CARE ABOUT BOTH OF YOU . . .

PADME: THANK YOU, OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN: PLEASE DO WHAT YOU CAN TO HELP HIM.

95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY

PADME, MON MOTHMA, AND FIVE OTHER SENATORS (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) SIT IN PADME'S LIVING ROOM. C-3PO SERVES DRINKS TO THE GUESTS.

PADME: WE CANNOT LET THIS TURN INTO ANOTHER WAR.

BAIL ORGANA: ABSOLUTELY, THAT IS THE LAST THING WE WANT.

MON MOTHMA: WE ARE HOPING TO FORM AN ALLIANCE IN THE SENATE TO STOP THE CHANCELLOR FROM FURTHER SUBVERTING THE CONSTITUTION, THAT'S ALL.

PADME: I KNOW A JEDI I FEEL IT WOULD BE WISE TO CONSULT.

BANA BREEMU: THAT WOULD BE DANGEROUS.

MON MOTHMA: WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE JEDI STAND IN ALL THIS.

PADME: I ONLY WISH TO DISCUSS THIS WITH ONE . . . ONE I TRUST.

GIDDEAN DANU: GOING AGAINST THE CHANCELLOR WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE JEDI IS RISKY.

PADME: THE JEDI AREN'T ANY HAPPIER WITH THE SITUATION THAN WE ARE . . .

CHI EEKWAY: PATIENCE, SENATOR.

FANG ZAR: WE HAVE SO MANY SENATORS ON OUR SIDE, SURELY THAT WILL PURSUADE THE CHANCELLOR.

BANA BREEMU: WHEN YOU PRESENT THE "PETITION OF THE TWO THOUSAND" TO THE CHANCELLOR, THINGS MAY CHANGE.

BAIL ORGANA: LET US SEE WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH IN THE SENATE, BEFORE WE INCLUDE THE JEDI.

PADME TAKES A DEEP BREATH IN FRUSTRATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT.

96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN AND OBI-WAN WALK ONTO A LANDING PLATFORM OVERLOOKING A DOCKING BAY WHERE THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS AND ARMORED WEAPONS, TANKS, ETC., ARE BEING LOADED ONTO A MASSIVE REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP.

ANAKIN: YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ME ON THIS ONE, MASTER.

OBI-WAN: OH, I AGREE. HOWEVER IT MAY TURN OUT JUST TO BE A WILD BANTHA CHASE.

OBI-WAN STARTS TO TURN AND LEAVE.

ANAKIN: MASTER!

OBI-WAN STOPS AND ANAKIN WALKS OVER TO HIM.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) MASTER, I'VE DISAPPOINTED YOU. I HAVE NOT BEEN VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR TRAINING . . . I HAVE BEEN ARROGANT AND I APOLOGIZE . . . I'VE JUST BEEN SO FRUSTRATED WITH THE COUNCIL. YOUR FRIENDSHIP MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.

OBI-WAN: YOU ARE STRONG AND WISE, ANAKIN, AND I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU. I HAVE TRAINED YOU SINCE YOU WERE A SMALL BOY. I HAVE TAUGHT YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW. AND YOU HAVE BECOME A FAR GREATER JEDI THAN I COULD EVER HOPE TO BE, AND YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE MORE TIMES THAN I CAN REMEMBER. BUT BE PATIENT, ANAKIN. IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THE COUNCIL MAKES YOU A JEDI MASTER.

OBI-WAN STARTS DOWN THE RAMP, THEN TURNS BACK.

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) DON'T WORRY. I HAVE ENOUGH CLONES WITH ME TO TAKE THREE SYSTEMS THE SIZE OF UTAPAU. I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE SITUATION . . . EVEN WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

ANAKIN: WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS A FIRST TIME.

OBI-WAN LAUGHS.

THEY TALK FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES BEFORE ANAKIN WATCHES OBI-WAN DEPART.

ANAKIN: OBI-WAN, MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.

OBI-WAN: GOOD-BYE, OLD FRIEND. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.

OBI-WAN HEADS DOWN A RAMP TOWARD THE WAITING REPUBLIC CRUISER.

97 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

THE REPUBLIC CRUISER LIFTS OFF AND HEADS FOR SPACE.

98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE

CLONE TROOPERS STAND AT ATTENTION IN ROWS ON THE FLOOR OF THE HANGAR DECK, WAITING TO BOARD LANDING CRAFT. OBI-WAN STANDS NEXT TO HIS BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- TALKING TO SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS WITH THEIR HELMETS OFF. A HOLOGRAM OF THE PLANET UTAPAU IS PROJECTED BY R4-G9 INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE HANGAR.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: FORTUNATELY, MOST OF THE CITIES ARE CONCENTRATED ON THIS SMALL CONTINENT HERE . . . ON THE FAR SIDE.

OBI-WAN: I'LL KEEP THEM DISTRACTED UNTIL YOU GET THERE. JUST DON'T TAKE TOO LONG.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: COME ON, BOSS, WHEN HAVE I EVER LET YOU DOWN?

THEY LAUGH.

OBI-WAN: (LAUGHING) CATO NEMOIDIA . . . FOR STARTERS.

OBI-WAN CLIMBS INTO HIS JEDI FIGHTER.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: THAT WAS ANAKIN WHO WAS LATE. I BELIEVE.

OBI-WAN: VERY WELL, THE BURDEN IS ON ME NOT TO DESTROY ALL THE DROIDS BEFORE YOU GET THERE.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE

OBI-WAN BLASTS THE BLUE JEDI FIGHTER OUT OF THE REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER AND INTO THE HYPERSPACE RING. HE HEADS FOR THE PLANET UTAPAU.

100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAY

THE CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT RACES THROUGH THE CITY AND HEADS FOR THE SENATE OFFICE BUILDING LANDING PLATFORM. WAITING ON THE LANDING PLATFORM IS A LONE JEDI. THE TRANSPORT LANDS, AND CHANCELLOR PALPATINE EMERGES WITH FOUR ROYAL GUARDS AND MAS AMEDDA. THE FOUR ROYAL GUARDS MOVE OFF IN ANOTHER DIRECTION AS PALPATINE GREETS ANAKIN, WHO HAS BEEN WAITING FOR HIM.

PALPATINE: WELL, ANAKIN, DID YOU SEE YOUR FRIEND OFF?

ANAKIN: HE WILL SOON HAVE GRIEVOUS'S HEAD.

PALPATINE: WE CAN ONLY HOPE THE COUNCIL DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE.

ANAKIN: THE COUNCIL WAS VERY SURE IN ITS DECISION.

THEY EXIT THE LANDING PLATFORM.

101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY

THEY ENTER THE MAIN HALLWAY OF THE SENATE OFFICE BUILDING. THEY PASS SEVERAL SENATORS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS FROM NABOO.

JAR JAR: HELLOO ANNIE. GOOD EN TO SEE YOUSA . . .

THE GUNGAN WAVES TO ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: HI, JAR JAR.

JAR JAR: OOPSIN DA CHANCELLOR!! SO SORRY, YOUR HIGHNESS, SIR.

ANAKIN TURNS BACK TO THE CHANCELLOR.

PALPATINE: THERE ARE RUMORS IN THE SENATE ABOUT MASTER KENOBI. MANY BELIEVE HE IS NOT FIT FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT.

ANAKIN: NOT FIT? WHY WOULD ANYONE THINK THAT?

PALPATINE: THEY SAY HIS MIND HAS BECOME FOGGED BY THE INFLUENCE OF A CERTAIN FEMALE SENATOR.

ANAKIN: THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WHO?!?

PALPATINE: (SLYLY) NO ONE KNOWS WHO SHE IS ... ONLY THAT SHE IS A SENATOR.

ANAKIN: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I WOULD KNOW.

PALPATINE: SOMETIMES THE CLOSEST ARE THE ONES WHO CANNOT SEE.

ANAKIN BECOMES WORRIED.

PALPATINE: (CONTINUING) IDLE SENATE GOSSIP IS RARELY TRUE AND NEVER ACCURATE. I'M SURE YOUR MASTER WILL DO FINE.

102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM

PADME CALLS OUT IN PAIN. OBI-WAN IS NEAR HER AND SOFTLY SPEAKS TO HER.

OBI-WAN: SAVE YOUR ENERGY.

PADME: I CAN'T!

OBI-WAN: DON'T GIVE UP, PADME. DON'T GIVE UP . . .

103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY

ANAKIN IS IN THE LIVING ROOM, WORKING. HE SITS ON THE COUCH WHERE OBI-WAN WAS SITTING. PADME ENTERS AND CROSSES BEHIND HIM.

ANAKIN: I SENSE SOMEONE FAMILIAR . . . OBI-WAN'S BEEN HERE, HASN'T HE?

PADME: HE CAME BY THIS MORNING.

ANAKIN: WHAT DID HE WANT?

PADME LOOKS AT HIM FOR A MOMENT. ANAKIN SEEMS TENSE.

PADME: HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

ANAKIN: YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT US, DIDN'T YOU?

SHE CONTINUES TO WALK TO THE BEDROOM, HE FOLLOWS.

PADME: HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND, ANAKIN. HE SAYS YOU'RE UNDER A LOT OF STRESS.

ANAKIN: AND HE'S NOT?

PADME: YOU HAVE BEEN MOODY LATELY.

ANAKIN: I'M NOT MOODY . . .

PADME: ANAKIN! DON'T DO THIS AGAIN.

ANAKIN: I DON'T KNOW ... I FEEL . . . LOST.

PADME: LOST? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE ALWAYS SO SURE OF YOURSELF. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

ANAKIN: OBI-WAN AND THE COUNCIL DON'T TRUST ME.

PADME: THEY TRUST YOU WITH THEIR LIVES. OBI-WAN LOVES YOU AS A SON.

ANAKIN: SOMETHING'S HAPPENING . . . I'M NOT THE JEDI I SHOULD BE. I AM ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL JEDI, BUT I'M NOT SATISFIED ... I WANT MORE, AND I KNOW I SHOULDN'T.

PADME: YOU EXPECT TOO MUCH OF YOURSELF.

THEY STOP IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW IN THE BEDROOM. ANAKIN PUTS HIS HAND ON HER BELLY.

ANAKIN: I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE YOU.

PADME: SAVE ME?

ANAKIN: FROM MY NIGHTMARES.

PADME: IS THAT WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

ANAKIN: I WON'T LOSE YOU, PADME.

PADME: I'M NOT GOING TO DIE IN CHILDBIRTH, ANNIE. I PROMISE YOU.

ANAKIN: NO, I PROMISE YOU! I AM BECOMING SO POWERFUL WITH MY NEW KNOWLEDGE OF THE FORCE, I WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP YOU FROM DYING.

PADME LOOKS ANAKIN IN THE EYE.

PADME: YOU DON'T NEED MORE POWER, ANAKIN. I BELIEVE YOU CAN PROTECT ME AGAINST ANYTHING, JUST AS YOU ARE.

THEY EMBRACE AND KISS.

104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE

OBI-WAN BLASTS OUT OF THE BLUE JEDI FIGHTER'S HYPERSPACE RING AND HEADS FOR THE PLANET UTAPAU. THE BLUE FIGHTER SKIMS OVER THE PLANET'S SURFACE, FLAT EXCEPT FOR A FEW GIANT SINKHOLES.

105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

OBI-WAN LANDS HIS SHIP ON A PLATFORM PROJECTING OUT OF THE SIDE OF A GIANT SINKHOLE. ALL IS QUIET. A LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR, TION MEDON, COMES OUT TO GREET THE SHIP. OBI-WAN CLIMBS OUT OF HIS FIGHTER AS A SHORT GROUND CREW LOOKS OVER HIS SHIP. ON A LEDGE ABOVE THE LANDING PLATFORM, GRIEVOUS'S BODYGUARDS WATCH AS OBI-WAN TALKS TO TION MEDON.

TLON MEDON: GREETINGS, YOUNG JEDI. WHAT BRINGS YOU TO OUR REMOTE SANCTUARY?

OBI-WAN: UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAR.

TLON MEDON: THERE IS NO WAR HERE UNLESS YOU'VE BROUGHT IT WITH YOU.

OBI-WAN: WITH YOUR KIND PERMISSION, I SHOULD LIKE SOME FUEL AND TO USE YOUR CITY AS A BASE AS I SEARCH NEARBY SYSTEMS FOR GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

A GROUND CREW RUSHES OUT AND REFUELS OBI-WAN�S FIGHTER. TION MEDON LEANS CLOSE TO OBI-WAN AND SPEAKS QUIETLY.

TLON MEDON: HE IS HERE! WE ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE. THEY ARE WATCHING US.

OBI-WAN: I UNDERSTAND.

TLON MEDON: THE TENTH LEVEL . . . THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS . . .

OBI-WAN: TELL YOUR PEOPLE TO TAKE SHELTER. IF YOU HAVE WARRIORS, NOW IS THE TIME.

OBI-WAN STARTS BACK TOWARD HIS STARFIGHTER AS TION MEDON LEAVES THE LANDING PLATFORM. GRIEVOUS'S BODYGUARDS RETREAT FROM THE OVERHEAD PLATFORM. OBI-WAN CLIMBS BACK INTO HIS BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. HIS ASTRO UNIT (R4-G9) TURNS TO HIM:

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) GEENINE, TAKE THE FIGHTER BACK TO THE SHIP. I'M STAYING HERE. TELL CODY I'VE MADE CONTACT.

THE LITTLE ASTRO DROID BEEPS A REPLY.

106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY

ON A HIGH BALCONY, TION MEDON LOOKS DOWN ON THE LANDING PLATFORM. A FEW STEPS BEHIND HIM STANDS ONE OF GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S BODYGUARDS. THEY WATCH THE CANOPY LOWER.

TLON MEDON: I TOLD YOU, ALL HE WANTED WAS FUEL.

BODYGUARD: WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

TLON MEDON: HE DIDN'T SAY.

THEY WATCH AS THE BLUE JEDI FIGHTER TAKES OFF.

107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY

OBI-WAN ALSO WATCHES HIS SHIP TAKE OFF. HE IS HIDING IN THE HALLWAY. HE QUIETLY MOVES FARTHER INTO THE CITY.

108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY

OBI-WAN QUICKLY RUSHES UP A STAIRWAY CUT INTO THE SIDE OF THE SINKHOLE. IT'S HARD TO SEE HIM. IN AN ALCOVE, HE CAREFULLY SURVEYS THE CITY, THEN QUICKLY MOVES ON.

109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY

OBI-WAN MAKES HIS WAY THROUGH THE CITY, LOOKING UP AT THE TENTH LEVEL WITH ELECTRO-BINOCULARS FROM HIS UTILITY BELT. HE TRIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW HE IS GOING TO GET UP THERE. HE HEARS STRANGE BELLOWING CRIES AND HE INVESTIGATES.
HE COMES ACROSS A CORRAL FILLED WITH ABOUT HALF A DOZEN DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS ARE STANDING AROUND.
OBI-WAN WALKS UP TO THE WRANGLERS AND USES THE FORCE WITH HIS SLIGHT HAND MOVEMENTS.

OBI-WAN: I NEED TRANSPORTATION.

WRANGLER: (SUBTITLED, IN NATIVE TONGUE) YOU NEED TRANSPORTATION.

OBI-WAN: GET IT FOR ME.

WRANGLER: (SUBTITLED, IN NATIVE TONGUE) I WILL GET IT FOR YOU.

ONE OF THE WRANGLERS TURNS TO THE OTHERS AND CHATTERS AWAY IN HIS STRANGE TONGUE. OBI-WAN WALKS ALONG THE LINE OF DRAGON/LIZARDS, CHECKING OUT EACH ONE. HE LOOKS AT THEIR TEETH, LEGS, ETC. FINALLY HE PATS ONE ON THE NECK.

OBI-WAN: THIS ONE.

THE WRANGLER BRINGS THE CHOSEN ONE OVER TO HIM.

WRANGLER: BOGA. SHE ANSWERS TO BOGA.

OBI-WAN: GOOD GIRL, BOGA.

OBI-WAN SWINGS ONTO THE BACK OF THE LIZARD. THE BEAST REARS UP AND SCURRIES OUTSIDE TO THE EDGE OF THE SINKHOLE.

110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY

THE LIZARD BOGA REARS UP ON HER HIND LEGS AGAIN, THEN CLIMBS THE WALL OF THE SHEER CLIFF AND STARTS MOVING UP TOWARD THE TENTH LEVEL. THE CITY APPEARS TO BE DESERTED. OBI-WAN IS ALERT TO ANY MOVEMENT.

111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS STANDS BEFORE THE COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, INCLUDING NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, AND PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN HIDES ABOVE THE ASSEMBLY AND WATCHES INTENTLY.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THE ARMIES OF THE REPUBLIC TRACK US HERE. I AM SENDING YOU TO THE MUSTAFAR SYSTEM IN THE OUTER RIM. IT IS A VOLCANIC PLANET WHICH GENERATES A GREAT DEAL OF SCANNING INTERFERENCE. YOU WILL BE SAFE THERE.

NUTE GUNRAY: SAFE? CHANCELLOR PALPATINE MANAGED TO ESCAPE YOUR GRIP, GENERAL, WITHOUT COUNT DOOKU. I HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO KEEP US SAFE.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: BE THANKFUL, VICEROY, YOU HAVE NOT FOUND YOURSELF IN MY GRIP . . . YOUR SHIP IS WAITING.

OBI-WAN IS DEEP IN THOUGHT.

112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

THE JEDI REMOVES HIS CLOAK AND JUMPS DOWN BEHIND THE GENERAL.

OBI-WAN: HELLO, THERE!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: GENERAL KENOBI, YOU ARE A BOLD ONE. I FIND YOUR BEHAVIOR BEWILDERING . . . SURELY YOU REALIZE YOU'RE DOOMED, (TO DROIDS) KILL HIM!

ABOUT A HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS SURROUND OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, AND HIS BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN LOOKS AROUND, THEN WALKS RIGHT UP TO GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: ENOUGH OF THIS.

THE BODYGUARDS RAISE THEIR POWER STAFFS TO KNOCK OBI-WAN AWAY, BUT OBI-WAN DUCKS AS THE DEADLY STAFFS WHISTLE OVER HIS HEAD. THE JEDI'S LIGHTSABER IGNITES, AND OBI-WAN DEFTLY CUTS ONE BODYGUARD IN TWO. HIS STAFF FLIES INTO THE AIR AND IS CAUGHT BY GENERAL GRIEVOUS. THE OTHER THREE BODYGUARDS ATTACK OBI-WAN WITH AN INTENSE FURY.
OBI-WAN USES THE FORCE TO RELEASE APIECE OF EQUIPMENT FROM THE CEILING. IT DROPS ON THE BODYGUARDS, SMASHING THEM. OBI-WAN WALKS TOWARD GRIEVOUS, SLASHING THE LAST BODYGUARD TO PIECES. BATTLE DROIDS MOVE TOWARD OBI-WAN.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: BACK AWAY. I WILL DEAL WITH THIS JEDI SLIME MYSELF.

OBI-WAN: YOUR MOVE.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: YOU FOOL. I HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN YOUR JEDI ARTS BY COUNT DOOKU HIMSELF. ATTACK, KENOBI.

HIS ARMS SEPARATE AND GRAB ALL FOUR LIGHTSABERS ON HIS BELT. HIS FOUR ARMS CREATE A FLASHING DISPLAY OF SWORDSMANSHIP.

OBI-WAN: YOU FORGET I TRAINED THE JEDI THAT DEFEATED COUNT DOOKU!

OBI-WAN IS HARD-PRESSED TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THE DEADLY ONSLAUGHT. THEY FIGHT ACROSS THE CONTROL ROOM AS THE BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS TRY TO PICK OFF THE JEDI. OBI-WAN MOUNTS A FEROCIOUS COUNTERATTACK AND CUTS OFF ONE OF GRIEVOUS'S HANDS. A LOUD EXPLOSION IS HEARD ECHOING THROUGHOUT THE SINKHOLE. GENERAL GRIEVOUS AND OBI-WAN GLANCE TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CONTROL CENTER AND SEE CLONE TROOPS IN THE DISTANCE, ATTACKING DROIDS IN THE SINKHOLE. ON THE FAR WALL OF THE SINKHOLE, CLONES CAN BE SEEN RAPPELLING ONTO BALCONIES.

OBI-WAN: I MAY NOT DEFEAT YOUR DROIDS, BUT MY TROOPS CERTAINLY WILL.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: ARMY OR NOT, YOU MUST REALIZE YOU ARE DOOMED.

OBI-WAN: I DON'T THINK SO.

TWENTY CLONES SUDDENLY RAPPEL INTO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CONTROL CENTER, RAY GUNS BLAZING. CHAOS. LASER BOLTS FLY EVERYWHERE AS THE DROIDS RETURN FIRE. OBI-WAN ATTACKS GENERAL GRIEVOUS, WHO DEFENDS HIMSELF RIGOROUSLY WITH ONE OF HIS BODYGUARD'S ELECTRO-STAFFS. OBI-WAN USES THE FORCE TO HURL GENERAL GRIEVOUS BACKWARDS. HE FALLS ONTO A LOWER PLATFORM AND OBI-WAN JUMPS DOWN AFTER HIM.

113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

MORE CLONES RAPPEL INTO THE CONTROL CENTER AND BLAST AWAY AT THE REMAINING DROIDS.
THE JEDI CUTS DOWN SEVERAL DROIDS AS HE RACES TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CONTROL CENTER. OBI-WAN SPOTS GENERAL GRIEVOUS RACING TOWARD ONE OF THE LANDING PLATFORMS IN THE MIDST OF THE BATTLE. GENERAL GRIEVOUS JUMPS ONTO A WHEEL SCOOTER AND TAKES OFF DOWN THE WALL OF THE SINKHOLE. OBI-WAN WHISTLES FOR HIS LIZARD BOGA, WHO RUNS TO HIM. OBI-WAN JUMPS ON.

114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

THE CHASE BEGINS. OBI-WAN DROPS HIS LIGHTSABER WHILE RIDING BOGA.

115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET

THE SUN IS SETTING AS THE LIGHTS COME ON IN THE MASSIVE SENATE OFFICE BUILDING. THE SKY IS RED.

116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET

PALPATINE LISTENS TO A DELEGATION FROM THE SENATE, WHICH INCLUDES PADME AND FIVE OTHER SENATORS: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, AND MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN STANDS TO ONE SIDE OF PALPATINE.

PALPATINE: I UNDERSTAND YOUR RESERVATIONS COMPLETELY, SENATOR, AND I ASSURE YOU THE APPOINTMENT OF GOVERNORS WILL IN NO WAY COMPETE WITH THE DUTIES OF THE SENATE.

PADME: MAY I TAKE IT THEN, THAT THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION?

PALPATINE: I WANT THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT TO END AS MUCH AS YOU DO, MY LADY, AND WHEN IT DOES I GUARANTEE AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO DEMOCRACY . . .

PADME: YOU ARE PURSUING A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO THE WAR, THEN.

PALPATINE: YOU MUST TRUST ME TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS, SENATOR. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE.

FANGZAR: BUT SURELY . . .

THE CHANCELLOR TURNS ON FANG ZAR.

PALPATINE: I HAVE SAID I WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT, THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR YOUR . . . COMMITTEE.

PADME: ON BEHALF OF THE "DELEGATION OF TWO THOUSAND," I THANK YOU, CHANCELLOR.

PALPATINE: I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO MY ATTENTION, SENATOR.

PADME GIVES ANAKIN A FRUSTRATED LOOK, THEN TURNS AND EXITS WITH THE OTHER FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE TURNS TO ANAKIN.

PALPATINE: (CONTINUING) THEIR SINCERITY IS TO BE ADMIRED, ALTHOUGH I SENSE THERE IS MORE TO THEIR REQUEST THAN THEY ARE TELLING US.

ANAKIN: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

PALPATINE: THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

ANAKIN: SURELY SENATOR AMIDALA CAN BE TRUSTED . . .

PALPATINE: THESE ARE UNSTABLE TIMES FOR THE REPUBLIC, ANAKIN. SOME SEE INSTABILITY AS AN OPPORTUNITY. SENATOR AMIDALA IS HIDING SOMETHING. I CAN SEE IT IN HER EYES.

ANAKIN: I'M SURE YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

PALPATINE: I'M SURPRISED YOUR JEDI INSIGHTS ARE NOT MORE SENSITIVE TO SUCH THINGS.

ANAKIN: I SIMPLY DON'T SENSE BETRAYAL IN SENATOR AMIDALA.

PALPATINE STUDIES ANAKIN CAREFULLY AND GIVES HIM A SKEPTICAL LOOK.

PALPATINE: YES, YOU DO, BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO ADMIT IT. THERE IS MUCH CONFLICT IN YOU, ANAKIN.

117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING

KI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, AND AAYLA SECURA TALK VIA HOLOGRAMS.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: MASTER WINDU, MAY I INTERRUPT? GENERAL KENOBI HAS MADE CONTACT WITH GENERAL GRIEVOUS, AND WE
HAVE BEGUN OUR ATTACK.

MACE WLNDU: THANK YOU, COMMANDER. ANAKIN, DELIVER THIS REPORT TO THE CHANCELLOR. HIS REACTION WILL GIVE US A CLUE TO HIS
INTENTIONS.

ANAKIN: YES, MASTER.

ANAKIN LEAVES THE ROOM. COMMANDER CODY'S HOLOGRAM DISAPPEARS.

MACE WINDU: I SENSE A PLOT TO DESTROY THE JEDI. THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE SURROUNDS THE CHANCELLOR.

KL-ADI-MUNDI: IF HE DOES NOT GIVE UP HIS EMERGENCY POWERS AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF GRIEVOUS, THEN HE SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM
OFFICE.

MACE WINDU: THAT COULD BE A DANGEROUS MOVE ... THE JEDI COUNCIL WOULD HAVE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE IN ORDER TO SECURE A PEACEFUL TRANSITION . . .

KL-ADI-MUNDI: . . . AND REPLACE THE CONGRESS WITH SENATORS WHO ARE NOT FILLED WITH GREED AND CORRUPTION.

YODA: TO A DARK PLACE THIS LINE OF THOUGHT WILL CARRY US. HMMMMM. . . . GREAT CARE WE MUST TAKE.

118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

ANAKIN BRINGS NEWS TO PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: CHANCELLOR, WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED A REPORT FROM MASTER KENOBI. HE HAS ENGAGED GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

PALPATINE: WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT MASTER KENOBI IS UP TO THE CHALLENGE.

ANAKIN: I SHOULD BE THERE WITH HIM.

PALPATINE: IT IS UPSETTING TO ME TO SEE THAT THE COUNCIL DOESN'T SEEM TO FULLY APPRECIATE YOUR TALENTS. DON'T YOU WONDER WHY THEY WON'T MAKE YOU A JEDI MASTER?

ANAKIN: I WISH I KNEW. MORE AND MORE I GET THE FEELING THAT I AM BEING EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNCIL. I KNOW THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT THE FORCE THAT THEY ARE NOT TELLING ME.

PALPATINE: THEY DON'T TRUST YOU, ANAKIN. THEY SEE YOUR FUTURE. THEY KNOW YOUR POWER WILL BE TOO STRONG TO CONTROL. ANAKIN, YOU MUST BREAK THROUGH THE FOG OF LIES THE JEDI HAVE CREATED AROUND YOU. LET ME HELP YOU TO KNOW THE SUBTLETIES OF THE FORCE.

THEY WALK INTO THE HALLWAY.

ANAKIN: HOW DO YOU KNOW THE WAYS OF THE FORCE?

PALPATINE: MY MENTOR TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FORCE . . . EVEN THE NATURE OF THE DARK SIDE.

THEY STOP.

ANAKIN: YOU KNOW THE DARK SIDE?!?

PALPATINE: ANAKIN, IF ONE IS TO UNDERSTAND THE GREAT MYSTERY, ONE MUST STUDY ALL ITS ASPECTS, NOT JUST THE DOGMATIC, NARROW VIEW OF THE JEDI. IF YOU WISH TO BECOME A COMPLETE AND WISE LEADER, YOU MUST EMBRACE A LARGER VIEW OF THE FORCE. BE CAREFUL OF THE JEDI, ANAKIN. (PAUSING) THEY FEAR YOU. IN TIME THEY WILL DESTROY YOU. LET ME TRAIN YOU.

ANAKIN: I WON'T BE A PAWN IN YOUR POLITICAL GAME. THE JEDI ARE MY FAMILY.

PALPATINE: ONLY THROUGH ME CAN YOU ACHIEVE A POWER GREATER THAN ANY JEDI. LEARN TO KNOW THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE, ANAKIN, AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE YOUR WIFE FROM CERTAIN DEATH.

ANAKIN: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

PALPATINE: USE MY KNOWLEDGE, I BEG YOU . . .

ANAKIN: YOU'RE A SITH LORD!

ANAKIN IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER.

PALPATINE: I KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN TROUBLING YOU . . . LISTEN TO ME. DON'T CONTINUE TO BE A PAWN OF THE JEDI COUNCIL! EVER SINCE I'VE KNOWN YOU, YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A LIFE GREATER THAN THAT OF AN ORDINARY JEDI . . . A LIFE OF SIGNIFICANCE, OF CONSCIENCE.

ANAKIN: YOU'RE WRONG!

PALPATINE: ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME?

ANAKIN: I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO.

PALPATINE: I KNOW YOU WOULD. I CAN FEEL YOUR ANGER. IT GIVES YOU FOCUS, MAKES YOU STRONGER.

ANAKIN RAISES HIS LIGHTSABER TO PALPATINE'S THROAT. THERE IS A TENSE MOMENT, THEN ANAKIN RELAXES, AND THEN TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER.

ANAKIN: I AM GOING TO TURN YOU OVER TO THE JEDI COUNCIL.

PALPATINE: OF COURSE YOU SHOULD. BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE OF THEIR INTENTIONS, ARE YOU? WHAT IF I AM RIGHT AND THEY ARE PLOTTING TO TAKE OVER THE REPUBLIC?

ANAKIN: I WILL QUICKLY DISCOVER THE TRUTH OF ALL THIS.

PALPATINE: YOU HAVE GREAT WISDOM, ANAKIN. KNOW THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE. THE POWER TO SAVE PADME.

ANAKIN STARES AT HIM FOR A MOMENT.
PALPATINE TURNS AND MOVES TO HIS OFFICE.

PALPATINE: (CONTINUING) I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE. YOU HAVE TIME TO DECIDE MY FATE. PERHAPS YOU'LL RECONSIDER AND HELP ME RULE THE GALAXY FOR THE GOOD OF ALL . . .

PALPATINE SITS BEHIND HIS DESK.

119 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

OBI-WAN GIVES THE LIZARD A SWIFT KICK WITH THE HEEL OF HIS BOOT, AND THEY TAKE OFF DOWN THE VERTICAL SIDE OF THE SHEER CLIFF. AS GENERAL GRIEVOUS REACHES THE LANDING PLATFORM WHERE HIS SHUTTLE IS WAITING. OBI-WAN DROPS ONTO THE TOP OF THE STARSHIP WITH HIS LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS SPINS HIS SCOOTER AROUND AND TAKES OFF UP THE VERTICAL CLIFF FACE WITH OBI-WAN AND HIS LIZARD IN HOT PURSUIT. THE SINKHOLE IS ENGULFED IN A GREAT BATTLE BETWEEN CLONES AND DROIDS. THE PEOPLE OF UTAPAU COWER IN WHATEVER SHELTER THEY CAN FIND.

120 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAY

A LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS ON LIZARDS ATTACK THE DROID ARMY.

OBI-WAN AND GENERAL GRIEVOUS RACE THROUGH THE CITY AT BREAKNECK SPEED. PASSING THROUGH BATTLE ZONES, NARROWLY ESCAPING EXPLOSIONS, LASER BOLTS, AND TROOPS FROM BOTH SIDES.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS LAYS THE SCOOTER DOWN AS HE GOES AROUND SHARP TURNS. OBI-WAN'S LIZARD BREATHES HARD AS SHE TRIES TO KEEP UP. THEY DESTROY DROIDS, EQUIPMENT, AND CLONE TROOPS AS THE JEDI AND THE GENERAL CUT A SWATH OF DESTRUCTION THROUGH THE CITY.

121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS WORKS HIS WAY OUT ONTO THE RIM OF THE SINKHOLE, PASSING SOME WIND BLADES. THE EVIL DROID GENERAL RELEASES THE BRAKES ON THE LETHAL BLADES, AND THEY BEGIN TO SPIN, CUTTING OFF OBI-WAN'S ACCESS TO THE GENERAL. OBI-WAN'S LIZARD PULLS UP SHORT IN FRONT OF THE BLADES. GENERAL GRIEVOUS LAUGHS AND TALKS INTO A COMLINK.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: PREPARE TO MOVE OUT OF ORBIT. I WILL BE UP IN A FEW MOMENTS.

OBI-WAN SIZES UP THE SITUATION, LOOKING FOR A WAY TO GET TO GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

THE GENERAL ACCELERATES OFF THE EDGE, ACTIVATING HIS CLAWS, DROPS, AND CLINGS TO ANOTHER NEARBY GROUPING OF WINDMILLS. OBI-WAN'S LIZARD ATTEMPTS TO JUMP TO FOLLOW AND BARELY MAKES IT, ALMOST FALLING INTO THE PRECIPICE BELOW.

122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS ROARS THROUGH THE STONE BLOCK TUNNEL SYSTEM, RIDING UP ON THE CURVED WALLS AS HE GOES AROUND CORNERS OR PASSES ONCOMING TRAFFIC. OBI-WAN RACES AFTER THE DROID, HIS LIZARD MOVING ONTO THE CEILING AS THEY PASS TRAFFIC. OBI-WAN CATCHES UP WITH GENERAL GRIEVOUS, AND THEY CHARGE THROUGH THE TUNNEL, SIDE BY SIDE. OBI-WAN GRABS THE DROID'S ELECTRONIC STAFF.

123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

EXTENDING FROM THE WALL OF A SMALL SINKHOLE IS A SECRET LANDING PLATFORM WITH A SMALL FEDERATION FIGHTER SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. OBI-WAN AND GENERAL GRIEVOUS RACE OUT OF THE TUNNEL SYSTEM AND ONTO THE LANDING PLATFORM.

OBI-WAN YANKS ON THE STAFF, THEN JUMPS OFF HIS LIZARD ONTO THE GENERAL'S SCOOTER, KNOCKING BOTH WARRIORS TO THE GROUND. GENERAL GRIEVOUS PULLS OUT A LASER PISTOL AND FIRES AT OBI-WAN. THE JEDI REACHES OUT HIS HAND, GRABS THE GENERAL'S ELECTRO-STAFF AND SPINS THE STAFF, BLOCKING THE LASER BOLTS.

OBI-WAN CHARGES GENERAL GRIEVOUS, SWINGING THE STAFF AND HITTING THE DROID IN THE STOMACH, KNOCKING THE GUN AWAY. GENERAL GRIEVOUS IS HIT BY THE STAFF, AND THE FORCE BENDS HIS FOREARM. HE PULLS OBI-WAN CLOSE TO HIM, AND THEY ENGAGE IN A FURIOUS FIGHT. THE ELECTRO-STAFF IS KNOCKED AWAY. THE TWO ENGAGE IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT. OBI-WAN STRUGGLES TO AVOID THE DEADLY BLOWS OF THE BRUTAL, UNSTOPPABLE DROID.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S STOMACHPLATE IS LOOSE. OBI-WAN GRABS IT AND RIPS IT OFF, REVEALING THE ALIEN LIFE FORM'S GUTS ENCASED IN A BAG IN THE DROID'S CHEST. GENERAL GRIEVOUS GRABS OBI-WAN, HOISTS HIM OVER HIS HEAD, AND TOSSES HIM ACROSS THE PLATFORM. OBI-WAN DANGLES OFF THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM. HE CLUTCHES THE RIM, TRYING TO HOLD ON. THE DROID THEN GRABS THE STAFF AND CHARGES OBI-WAN. AT THE LAST SECOND, OBI-WAN REACHES OUT HIS HAND AND USES THE FORCE TO RETRIEVE THE DROID'S LASER PISTOL.

THE JEDI FIRES SEVERAL BLASTS IN THE STOMACH AREA OF THE ALIEN DROID, AND HE EXPLODES FROM THE INSIDE OUT. THE SMOLDERING DROID FALLS TO THE GROUND. OBI-WAN HAS KILLED GENERAL GRIEVOUS. HE PULLS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE PLATFORM AND WALKS BY THE DESTROYED CARCASS.

OBI-WAN: SO UNCIVILIZED . . .

OBI-WAN BRUSHES HIMSELF OFF. HE THROWS THE PISTOL ONTO THE PLATFORM, PICKS UP THE ELECTRO-STAFF, AND JUMPS ON BOGA. THE TRUSTY BEAST REARS UP AND TAKES OFF INTO THE TUNNEL SYSTEM.

124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING

MACE AND THE JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) ARE PREPARING TO BOARD A JEDI GUNSHIP TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. ANAKIN ENTERS THE HANGAR.

ANAKIN: MASTER WINDU, I MUST TALK TO YOU.

MACE WINDU: WHAT IS IT, SKYWALKER? WE ARE IN A HURRY. WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED WORD THAT OBI-WAN HAS DESTROYED GENERAL GRIEVOUS. WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO MAKE SURE THE CHANCELLOR RETURNS EMERGENCY POWERS BACK TO THE SENATE.

ANAKIN: HE WON'T GIVE UP HIS POWER. I'VE JUST LEARNED A TERRIBLE TRUTH. I THINK CHANCELLOR PALPATINE IS A SITH LORD.

MACE WINDU: A SITH LORD?

ANAKIN: YES. THE ONE WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

MACE WINDU: HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

ANAKIN: HE KNOWS THE WAYS OF THE FORCE. HE HAS BEEN TRAINED TO USE THE DARK SIDE.

MACE WINDU: ARE YOU SURE?

ANAKIN: ABSOLUTELY.

MACE WINDU: THEN OUR WORST FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED. WE MUST MOVE QUICKLY IF THE JEDI ORDER IS TO SURVIVE.

ANAKIN: MASTER, THE CHANCELLOR IS VERY POWERFUL. YOU WILL NEED MY HELP IF YOU ARE GOING TO ARREST HIM.

MACE WINDU: FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, STAY OUT OF THIS AFFAIR. I SENSE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION IN YOU, YOUNG SKYWALKER. THERE IS MUCH FEAR THAT CLOUDS YOUR JUDGMENT.

ANAKIN: I MUST GO, MASTER.

MACE WINDU: NO. IF WHAT YOU TOLD ME IS TRUE, YOU WILL HAVE GAINED MY TRUST, BUT FOR NOW REMAIN HERE.

ANAKIN: YES, MASTER.

MACE WINDU: WAIT FOR US IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBER UNTIL WE RETURN.

ANAKIN: YES, MASTER.

ANAKIN WATCHES AS THE JEDI LEAVE IN THEIR SHIP.

125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING

(INTERCUT)

PADME IS ALONE IN HER APARTMENT, THINKING OF ANAKIN. ANAKIN SITS ALONE IN THE JEDI COUNCIL CHAMBER THINKING OF PADME.

PALPATINE: (V.O.) YOU DO KNOW, DON'T YOU, IF THE JEDI DESTROY ME, ANY CHANCE OF SAVING HER WILL BE LOST.

PADME: I TRULY, DEEPLY LOVE YOU. BEFORE I DIE. I WANT YOU TO KNOW.

C-3PO: MY LADY, ARE YOU. . . . ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

ANAKIN: I CAN'T DO THIS ... I CAN'T LET HER DIE.

ANAKIN RUSHES OUT OF THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND TO HIS SPEEDER. THE HANGAR DOOR OPENS AND HE LIFTS OFF.

126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING

THE SKY IS STILL BLUE AS A JEDI GUNSHIP LANDS ON THE SENATE OFFICE BUILDING LANDING PLATFORM.
FOUR JEDI EXIT THE SHUTTLE AND ENTER THE SENATE OFFICE BUILDING. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN, LIKE GUNFIGHTERS OUT OF THE OLD WEST, WALK THROUGH THE MASSIVE HALLWAY, FOUR ACROSS.

127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

THE FOUR JEDI ENTER THE LOBBY, RAISING THEIR ARMS, AND SEND THE CHANCELLOR'S AIDE, DAR WAC, FLYING AGAINST THE WALL, ALONG WITH TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. THEY STORM INTO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE.

128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR�S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

MACE ARRIVES WITH THREE JEDI TO ARREST PALPATINE.

PALPATINE: MASTER WINDU. I TAKE IT GENERAL GRIEVOUS HAS BEEN DESTROYED THEN. I MUST SAY, YOU'RE HERE SOONER THAN EXPECTED.

MACE WINDU: IN THE NAME OF THE GALACTIC SENATE OF THE REPUBLIC, YOU ARE UNDER ARREST, CHANCELLOR.

MACE WINDU AND THE OTHER JEDI IGNITE THEIR LIGHTSABERS.

PALPATINE: ARE YOU THREATENING ME, MASTER JEDI?

MACE: THE SENATE WILL DECIDE YOUR FATE.

PALPATINE: (BURST OF ANGER) I AM THE SENATE!

MACE: NOT YET!

PALPATINE STANDS, A LASER SWORD APPEARS OUT OF HIS CLOAK SLEEVE, AND HE SPINS TOWARD THE JEDI.

PALPATINE: IT'S TREASON, THEN.

A CLOSE SHOT OF PALPATINE AS THE FIGHT BEGINS. CLOSE SHOTS OF THREE JEDI GETTING CUT DOWN BY PALPATINE. PALPATINE AND MACE CONTINUE TO FIGHT.

JEDI MASTER MACE WINDU AND THE SITH LORD FIGHT THEIR WAY DOWN THE HALLWAY AND INTO THE MAIN OFFICE AREA. PALPATINE IS ABLE TO USE THE FORCE TO SLAM MACE AGAINST THE WALL, BUT HE RECOVERS BEFORE THE CHANCELLOR CAN CUT HIM DOWN.

ANAKIN LANDS HIS SPEEDER, JUMPS OUT, AND RUNS DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR TOWARD THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE.

IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE, MACE CUTS THE WINDOW BEHIND THE CHANCELLOR'S DESK, AND IT CRASHES AWAY. MACE IS FORCED OUT ONTO THE LEDGE, WHICH IS TWENTY STORIES UP. THEY FIGHT OVER THE PRECIPICE. ANAKIN ARRIVES TO SEE PALPATINE AND MACE FIGHTING.

THEY STOP AS MACE FORCES PALPATINE TO DROP HIS SWORD. PALPATINE AND MACE START YELLING AT EACH OTHER.

MACE WINDU: YOU ARE UNDER ARREST, MY LORD.

PALPATINE: ANAKIN! I TOLD YOU IT WOULD COME TO THIS. I WAS RIGHT. THE JEDI ARE TAKING OVER.

MACE WLNDU: YOU OLD FOOL. THE OPPRESSION OF THE SITH WILL NEVER RETURN. YOUR PLOT TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE REPUBLIC IS OVER . . . YOU HAVE LOST . . .

PALPATINE: NO! NO! YOU WILL DIE!

PALPATINE RAISES HIS HANDS, AND LIGHTNING BOLTS SHOOT OUT. THEY ARE BLOCKED BY MACE'S LIGHTSABER. PALPATINE IS PUSHED BACK AGAINST THE WINDOW SILL.

PALPATINE: HE IS A TRAITOR, ANAKIN.

MACE WLNDU: HE'S THE TRAITOR. STOP HIM!

PALPATINE: COME TO YOUR SENSES, BOY. THE JEDI ARE IN REVOLT. THEY WILL BETRAY YOU, JUST AS THEY BETRAYED ME.

MACE WLNDU: AARRRRGGGHHHHH . . .

PALPATINE: YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THEM, ANAKIN. DON'T LET HIM KILL ME.

MACE WLNDU: AARRRRGGGHHHHH . . .

PALPATINE: I AM YOUR PATHWAY TO POWER. I HAVE THE POWER TO SAVE THE ONE YOU LOVE. YOU MUST CHOOSE. YOU MUST STOP HIM.

MACE WLNDU: DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, ANAKIN.

PALPATINE: HELP ME! DON'T LET HIM KILL ME. I CAN'T HOLD ON ANY LONGER. AHHHHHHH . . . AHHHHHHH . . . AHHHHHHH . . .

MACE PUSHES PALPATINE OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE LEDGE. AS THE JEDI MOVES CLOSER, THE BOLTS FROM PALPATINE'S HANDS BEGIN TO ARCH BACK ON HIM. THE CHANCELLOR'S FACE BEGINS TO TWIST AND DISTORT. HIS EYES BECOME YELLOW AS HE STRUGGLES TO INTENSIFY HIS POWERS.

PALPATINE: I CAN'T ... I GIVE UP. HELP ME. I AM WEAK ... I AM TOO WEAK. DON'T KILL ME. I GIVE UP. I'M DYING. I CAN'T HOLD ON ANY LONGER.

MACE WLNDU: YOU SITH DISEASE. I AM GOING TO END THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

ANAKIN: YOU CAN'T KILL HIM, MASTER. HE MUST STAND TRIAL.

MACE WLNDU: HE HAS TOO MUCH CONTROL OF THE SENATE AND THE COURTS. HE IS TOO DANGEROUS TO BE KEPT ALIVE.

PALPATINE: I'M TOO WEAK. DON'T KILL ME. PLEASE.

ANAKIN: IT IS NOT THE JEDI WAY . . .

MACE RAISES HIS SWORD TO KILL THE CHANCELLOR.

ANAKIN: (CONTINUING) HE MUST LIVE . . .

PALPATINE: PLEASE DON'T, PLEASE DON'T . . .

ANAKIN: I NEED HIM . . .

PALPATINE: PLEASE DON'T . . .

ANAKIN: NO!!!

JUST AS MACE IS ABOUT TO SLASH PALPATINE, ANAKIN STEPS IN AND CUTS OFF THE JEDI'S HAND HOLDING THE LIGHTSABER.

AS MACE STARES AT ANAKIN IN SHOCK, PALPATINE SPRINGS TO LIFE.
THE FULL FORCE OF PALPATINE'S POWERFUL BOLTS BLASTS MACE. HE ATTEMPTS TO DEFLECT THEM WITH HIS ONE GOOD HAND, BUT THE FORCE IS TOO GREAT. AS BLUE RAYS ENGULF HIS BODY, HE IS FLUNG OUT THE WINDOW AND FALLS TWENTY STORIES TO HIS DEATH. NO MORE SCREAMS. NO MORE MOANS. PALPATINE LOWERS HIS ARM.

PALPATINE: POWER! UNLIMITED POWER!

HIS FACE HAS CHANGED INTO A HORRIBLE MASK OF EVIL. ANAKIN LOOKS ON IN HORROR. PALPATINE CACKLES.

ANAKIN: WHAT HAVE I DONE?

ANAKIN SITS.

PALPATINE: YOU ARE FULFILLING YOUR DESTIN, ANAKIN. BECOME MY APPRENTICE. LEARN TO USE THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE.

ANAKIN: I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU ASK.

PALPATINE: GOOD.

ANAKIN: JUST HELP ME SAVE PADME'S LIFE. I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER. I WON'T LET HER DIE. I WANT THE POWER TO STOP DEATH.

PALPATINE: TO CHEAT DEATH IS A POWER ONLY ONE HAS ACHIEVED, BUT IF WE WORK TOGETHER, I KNOW WE CAN DISCOVER THE SECRET.

ANAKIN KNEELS BEFORE PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: I PLEDGE MYSELF TO YOUR TEACHINGS. TO THE WAYS OF THE SITH.

PALPATINE: GOOD. GOOD. THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH YOU. A POWERFUL SITH YOU WILL BECOME. HENCEFORTH, YOU SHALL BE KNOWN AS DARTH . . . VADER.

ANAKIN: THANK YOU. MY MASTER.

PALPATINE: RISE, DARTH VADER.

PALPATINE MOVES OVER TO HIS DESK.

129 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY

YODA WINCES, CLOSES HIS EYES, AND HOLDS HIS HEAD. HE FEELS A DISTURBANCE IN THE FORCE.

130 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EVENING

PALPATINE IS PUTTING ON HIS DARK CLOAK: HE IS NOW FULLY DARTH SIDIOUS.

PALPATINE: BECAUSE THE COUNCIL DID NOT TRUST YOU, MY YOUNG APPRENTICE, I BELIEVE YOU ARE THE ONLY JEDI WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PLOT. WHEN THE JEDI LEARN WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED HERE, THEY WILL KILL US, ALONG WITH ALL THE SENATORS.

ANAKIN: I AGREE. THE JEDI'S NEXT MOVE WILL BE AGAINST THE SENATE.

PALPATINE: EVERY SINGLE JEDI, INCLUDING YOUR FRIEND OBI-WAN KENOBI, IS NOW AN ENEMY OF THE REPUBLIC. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, DON'T YOU?

ANAKIN: I UNDERSTAND, MASTER.

PALPATINE: WE MUST MOVE QUICKLY. THE JEDI ARE RELENTLESS; IF THEY ARE NOT ALL DESTROYED, IT WILL BE CIVIL WAR WITHOUT END. FIRST, I WANT YOU TO GO TO THE JEDI TEMPLE. WE WILL CATCH THEM OFF BALANCE. DO WHAT MUST BE DONE, LORD VADER. DO NOT HESITATE. SHOW NO MERCY. ONLY THEN WILL YOU BE STRONG ENOUGH WITH THE DARK SIDE TO SAVE PADME.

ANAKIN: WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER JEDI SPREAD ACROSS THE GALAXY?

PADME: WHAT IF THEY START AN INQUISITION? I'VE OPPOSED THIS WAR. WHAT WILL YOU DO IF I BECOME A SUSPECT?

ANAKIN: THAT WON'T HAPPEN. I WON'T LET IT.

PADME: OH, ANAKIN, I'M AFRAID.

ANAKIN TAKES PADME IN HIS ARMS.

ANAKIN: HAVE FAITH, MY LOVE. EVERYTHING WILL SOON BE SET RIGHT. THE CHANCELLOR HAS GIVEN ME A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION. THE SEPARATISTS HAVE GATHERED IN THE MUSTAFAR SYSTEM. I'M GOING THERE TO END THIS WAR. WAIT FOR ME UNTIL I RETURN . . . THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT, I PROMISE.

ANAKIN: I WON'T LOSE YOU THE WAY I LOST MY MOTHER! I'VE BECOME MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY JEDI HAS EVER DREAMED OF AND I'VE DONE IT FOR YOU. TO PROTECT YOU.

PADME: COME AWAY WITH ME. HELP ME RAISE OUR CHILD. LEAVE EVERYTHING ELSE BEHIND WHILE WE STILL CAN.

ANAKIN: DON'T YOU SEE, WE DON'T HAVE TO RUN AWAY ANYMORE. I HAVE BROUGHT PEACE TO THE REPUBLIC. I AM MORE POWERFUL THAN THE CHANCELLOR. I CAN OVERTHROW HIM, AND TOGETHER YOU AND I CAN RULE THE GALAXY. MAKE THINGS THE WAY WE WANT THEM TO BE.

PADME: I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M HEARING . . . OBI-WAN WAS RIGHT. YOU'VE CHANGED.

ANAKIN: I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT OBI-WAN. THE JEDI TURNED AGAINST ME. DON'T YOU TURN AGAINST ME.

THEY CIRCLE EACH OTHER UNTIL OBI-WAN IS NEAR PADME. HE PLACES HIS HAND ON HER.

ANAKIN: DON'T LECTURE ME, OBI-WAN. I SEE THROUGH THE LIES OF THE JEDI. I DO NOT FEAR THE DARK SIDE AS YOU DO. I HAVE BROUGHT PEACE, JUSTICE, FREEDOM, AND SECURITY TO MY NEW EMPIRE.

ANAKIN: I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE JEDI WERE PLOTTING TO TAKE OVER . . .

OBI-WAN: FROM THE SITH!!! ANAKIN, CHANCELLOR PALPATINE IS EVIL.

ANAKIN: FROM THE JEDI POINT OF VIEW! FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, THE JEDI ARE EVIL.

OBI-WAN: WELL, THEN YOU ARE LOST!

ANAKIN: THIS IS THE END FOR YOU, MY MASTER. I WISH IT WERE OTHERWISE.

ANAKIN JUMPS AND FLIPS ONTO OBI- WAN'S PLATFORM. THE FIGHTING CONTINUES AGAIN UNTIL OBI-WAN JUMPS TOWARD THE SAFETY OF THE BLACK SANDY EDGE OF THE LAVA RIVER. HE YELLS AT ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN: IT'S OVER, ANAKIN. I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND.

ANAKIN: YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER!

OBI-WAN: DON'T TRY IT.

ANAKIN FOLLOWS, AND OBI-WAN CUTS HIS YOUNG APPRENTICE AT THE KNEES, THEN CUTS OFF HIS LEFT ARM IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. ANAKIN TUMBLES DOWN THE EMBANKMENT AND ROLLS TO A STOP NEAR THE EDGE OF THE LAVA.

ANAKIN STRUGGLES TO PULL HIMSELF UP THE EMBANKMENT WITH HIS MECHANICAL HAND. HIS THIN LEATHER GLOVE HAS BEEN BURNED OFF. HE KEEPS SLIDING DOWN IN THE BLACK SAND.

OBI-WAN: (CONTINUING) . . . YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE! IT WAS SAID THAT YOU WOULD, DESTROY THE SITH, NOT JOIN THEM. IT WAS YOU WHO WOULD BRING BALANCE TO THE FORCE, NOT LEAVE IT IN DARKNESS.

OBI-WAN PICKS UP ANAKIN'S LIGHT SABER AND BEGINS TO WALK AWAY. HE STOPS AND LOOKS BACK.

ANAKIN: I HATE YOU!

OBI-WAN: YOU WERE MY BROTHER, ANAKIN. I LOVED YOU.

QUI -GON: (V.O.) PATIENCE. YOU WILL HAVE TIME. I DID NOT. WHEN I BECAME ONE WITH THE FORCE I MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY. WITH MY TRAINING, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MERGE WITH THE FORCE AT WILL. YOUR PHYSICAL SELF WILL FADE AWAY, BUT YOU WILL STILL RETAIN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS. YOU WILL BECOME MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY SITH.

YODA: ETERNAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

QUI-GON: (V.O.) THE ABILITY TO DEFY OBLIVION CAN BE ACHIEVED, BUT ONLY FOR ONESELF. IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY A SHAMAN OF THE WHILLS. IT IS A STATE ACQUIRED THROUGH COMPASSION, NOT GREED.

YODA: . . . TO BECOME ONE WITH THE FORCE, AND INFLUENCE STILL HAVE . . . A POWER GREATER THAN ALL, IT IS.

QUI-GON: (V.O.) YOU WILL LEARN TO LET GO OF EVERYTHING. NO ATTACHMENT, NO THOUGHT OF SELF. NO PHYSICAL SELF.
