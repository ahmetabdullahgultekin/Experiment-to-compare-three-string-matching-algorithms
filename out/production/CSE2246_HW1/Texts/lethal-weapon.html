                             BY SHANE BLACK




     FADE IN:

     CITY OF ANGELS

     LIES SPREAD OUT BENEATH US IN ALL ITS  SPLENDOR,  LIKE  A
     BARGAIN BASEMENT PROMISED LAND.

     CAMERA SOARS, DIPS, WINDS ITS WAY SLOWLY  DOWN,  DOWN,
     BRINGING US IN OVER THE CITY AS WE:

     SUPER MAIN TITLES.

     TITLES END, AS WE --

     SPIRAL DOWN TOWARD A LUSH, HIGH-RISE APARTMENT COMPLEX.
     THE MOON REFLECTED IN GLASS.

     CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE IN THROUGH BILLOWING CURTAINS,
     INTO THE INNER SANCTUM OF A  PENTHOUSE  APARTMENT,  AND
     HERE, BOYS AND GIRLS, IS WHERE WE LOSE OUR BREATH,
     BECAUSE --

     SPREAD-EAGLED ON A SUMPTUOUS DESIGNER SOFA LIES THE
     SINGLE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE CITY.
     BLONDE HAIR. A SATIN NIGHTGOWN THAT POSITIVELY  GLOWS.
     SAM COOKE MUSIC, CROONING FROM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR
     SPEAKERS.

     PASTEL COLORS. WINDOW  WALLS.  NEW  WAVE  FURNITURE  TOR-
     TURED INTO WEIRD SHAPES.  IT LOOKS LIKE ROBOTS LIVE HERE.

     ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE SLEEPING VENUS  LIES  AN  OPEN
     BOTTLE OF PILLS ... NEXT TO THAT, A MIRROR DUSTED WITH
     COCAINE.

     SHE ROUSES HERSELF TO SMEAR SOME POWDER  ON  HER  GUMS.
     AS SHE DOES, WE SEE FROM HER EYES THAT SHE IS THOROUGHLY,
     COMPLETELY WHACKED OUT OF HER MIND...

     SHE STANDS, STUMBLES ACROSS THE ROOM, PAUSING TO GLANCE
     AT A PHOTOGRAPH ON THE WALL:

     TWO MEN.  SOLDIERS.  YOUNG, ROUGH-HEWN, ARMS AROUND EACH
     OTHER.

     THE GIRL THROWS OPEN THE GLASS DOORS ... STEPS OUT ONTO A
     BALCONY, AND THERE, BENEATH HER, LIES  ALL  OF  NIGHTTIME
     L.A.  PANORAMIC SPLENDOR.  HER HAIR FLIES, HER EXPRESSION.
     RAPT, AS SHE STANDS AGAINST THIS SEA OF TECHNOLOGY.  SHE
     IS BEAUTIFUL.

     ON THE BALCONY RAILING BESIDE HER  STAND  THREE  POTTED
     PLANTS.

     THE GIRL SEES THEM, PICKS ONE UP.  LOOKS OVER THE BALCONY
     RAILING ... IT IS TEN STORIES DOWN TO THE PARKING LOT.
     SHE SQUINTS, HOLDS THE PLANT OVER THE EDGE.

                         GIRL
               RED CAR.

     DROPS THE PLANT.  DOWN IT GOES, SPIRALLING END OVER END
     -- UNTIL, FINALLY ... BAM --  !  SHATTERS.  DIRT  FLIES.  A
     RED CHEVY IS NOW MINUS A WINDSHIELD.  THE GIRL TAKES
     ANOTHER PLANT.

                         GIRL
               GREEN CAR.

     SHE DROPS IT.  GREEN DODGE.  TEN STORIES BELOW, BAM
     IMPACT CITY.  SCRATCH ONE PAINT JOB.  GRABS THE FINAL
     PLANT AND HOLDS IT OUT, SAYING:

                         GIRL
               BLUE CAR.

     POW.  GLASS SHATTERS.  DIRT SPRAYS.  A BLUE BMW THIS
     TIME.  THE GIRL LOVES THIS GAME ... HER EXPRESSION IS
     SLIGHTLY CRAZED.  SHE REACHES FOR ANOTHER PLANT --
     THERE AREN'T ANY.  HER SMILE FADES -- AND FOR A MOMENT,
     JUST A MOMENT, THE DULLNESS LEAVES HER EYES AND SHE IS
     SUDDENLY, INCREDIBLY SOBER.  AND TEARS FILL HER EYES AS
     SHE LOOKS OVER THE EDGE --

                         GIRL
               YELLOW CAR.

     AND JUMPS THE RAILING. PLUMMETS, HEAD  OVER  HEELS  LIKE  A
     RAG DOLL. HITS THE YELLOW CAR  SPOT  ON.  SHE  LIES,  DEAD,
     LIKE AN EXTINGUISHED DREAM.  STILL BEAUTIFUL.

                                                  CUT TO:

1A   EXT. BENEATH THE PIER    NIGHT                         1A

     FOUR TOUGH-LOOKING DOCK WORKERS ARE CAMPED  OUT  UNDER  THE
     PIER, WARMING THEMSELVES AROUND A SMALL BONFIRE, LAUGHING
     LOUDLY.  CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS DANGLE ABOVE THEM FROM THE
     PIER, AND EMPTY BEER CANS LITTER THE SAND AROUND THEM.

     CAMERA PUSHES IN TO DISCOVER AN OLD COLLIE TIED TO ONE OF
     THE PILINGS. THEN WE REALIZE THAT THE  DOG  IS  BEING  TOR-
     MENTED BY THE DOCK WORKERS.  THEY FLICK LIGHTED MATCHES
     AT HIM.  SHAKE THEIR BEERS AND SPRAY HIM IN THE FACE.
     THESE GUYS ARE NOT ROCKET SCIENTISTS.

     THE DOG COWERS, TUGGING BN THE ROPE.  TRIES  TO  GET  AWAY.
     ALL TO THE GREAT AMUSEMENT OF ITS TORMENTORS.

     ONE OF THEM TURNS, LAUGHING --

     AS A SHADOWY FIGURE STRIDES CALMLY UP TO THE FIRE:
     LONG HAIR.
     CIGARETTE DANGLING FROM-LOWER LIP.
     SHIRT-TAILS HANGING LOOSE BELOW THE WAIST.

     NOTHING THREATENING IN HIS MANNER AS HE PLOPS DOWN  BESIDE
     THE MEN, SMILING.
     THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY ON THEIR GUARD.

                         RIGGS (FIGURE)
               HAPPY HOLIDAYS.  MIND IF I JOIN
               YOU?

                         PUNK  #1
               YES.

                         PUNK  #2
               FUCK OFF.

     RIGGS SMILES AT HIM INNOCENTLY.  STROKES THE COLLIE'S FUR
     WITH ONE HAND.
     WITH THE OTHER, HE REACHES INTB A PAPER SACK AND PRODUCES,
     A SPANKING NEW BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS, POSSIBLY THE FINEST
     DRINK MANKIND HAS  YET  PRODUCED.

                         RIGGS
               I NEED HELP DRINKING THIS.  COOL?

     THE DOCK WORKERS EXCHANGE GLANCES.  THERE SEEMS TO BE NO
     HARM IN THIS.  ONE OF THEM FROWNS:

                         PUNK  #1
               YOU A HOMO?

                         RIGGS
               DO I LOOK LIKE A HOMO?

                         PUNK  #1
               YOU GOT LONG HAIR.  HOMOS GOT LONG
               HAIR.

                         PUNK #3
               I HATE HOMOS.  ARRGGH.

     RIGGS SHAKES HIS HEAD, LAUGHS.

                         RIGGS
               BOY, YOU GUYS ARE TERRIFIC.  YOU
               MAKE ME LAUGH, YOU JUST DO.

     AT WHICH POINT, APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH, PUNK #4 SHAKES A
     BEER AND SPRAYS IT IN THE OLD COLLIE'S FACE.

     THE DOG PULLS  AWAY,  WHINING.
     RIGGS LEANS FORWARD.

                         RIGGS
               THIS YOUR DOG?  NICE DOG.

     AND THEN, HE PROCEEDS TO DO A PECULIAR THING:
     HE STARTS TO TALK TO THE DOG --
     IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE DOG'S OWN LANGUAGE.
     VERY WEIRD, FOLKS...
     HE COOS, SNUFFLES, BARKS SOFTLY, THEN WITHDRAWS,
     LISTENING, HIS EAR TO THE DOG'S MUZZLE.
     RIGGS NODS.  FROWNS.
     THE OTHERS LOOK  ON,  PUZZLED.
     THEN RIGGS LOOKS AT EACH OF THE FOUR DOCK WORKERS.

                         RIGGS
               HUH-  YOU KNOW WHAT?  HE SAYS HE
               DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SPRAY BEER IN
               HIS FACE.  HE SAYS HE JUST HATES
               THAT.

     A PAUSE.  UNCOMFORTABLE.  THEN --

                         PUNK #1
               OH, HE DOES ... ?
                    (BEAT)
               WELL, MISTER, WHY DON'T YOU ASK
               HIM WHAT HE LIKES...?

     THE OTHERS SNICKER.  RIGGS SIMPLY NODS.

                         RIGGS
               OKAY.

     AND ONCE AGAIN, BEGINS TO CONFER WITH THE DOG.  LISTENS
     INTENTLY, PIECING TOGETHER WHAT HE IS HEARING.

                         RIGGS
               WHAT ... ? YOU WANT ...  OH.  OH,
               HELL NO, I COULDN'T DO  THAT  ...
               NOSSIRREE BOB,  YOU  LITTLE  NUT.

     HE RUFFLES THE DOG'S HAIR.
     THE MEN ARE MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER AS RIGGS TURNS AND
     SAYS:

                         RIGGS
                    (CHUCKLING)
               GET THIS: HE WANTS  ME  TO  BEAT
               THE SHIT OUT OF YOU GUYS.

     EVERYTHING STOPS.  A CLOUD PASSES OVER THE ASSEMBLED
     FACES AND A  PIN-DROPPING  SILENCE  ENSUES.

     RIGGS, COMPLETELY HEEDLESS, ONCE AGAIN ATTENDS TO THE DOG:

                         RIGGS
               WHAT'S THAT ... ?  THE ONE ... IN THE
               MIDDLE...  'IS A STUPID FAT DUCK'...
               WHAT ... ?
                    (LISTENS AGAIN)
               OH ... OH!  A 'STUPID FAT FUCK!'
               RIGHT.

     HE LOOKS UP, SHAKES HIS HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               BOY, THIS DOG IS PISSED.

     THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE GRABS RIGGS BY THE COLLAR.
     HOISTS HIM TO HIS FEET.  GULP.

     STANDS, STARING DOWN AT RIGGS, WHOSE EYES ARE COMPLETELY
     NEUTRAL, LIKE A SNAKE'S.

                         PUNK #1
               BUDDY, YOU'RE SHORTENING YOUR
               LIFE SPAN.

     HE FLICKS OPEN A MEAN-LOOKING SWITCHBLADE.

     RIGGS IS DEAD MEAT.

     SO WHY THEN, DOES HE CHOOSE THIS MOMENT TO EXECUTE A
     THREE STOOGES' ROUTINE, CONSISTING OF NOSE TWEAK, EYE
     GOUGE, AND ROTATING FIST THAT BOBS THE DOCK WORKER ON
     THE HEAD... ?

     HE'S NUTS OR SOMETHING ...

     RIGGS STEPS BACK AND ADOPTS A NEUTRAL FIGHTING STANCE.
     THE OTHERS BEGIN TO CIRCLE.

     THE DOG BARKS.  RIGGS TURNS TO THE DOG, BUT HIS EYES NEVER
     LEAVE HIS GRINNING ATTACKERS.

                         RIGGS
                    (TO THE COLLIE)
               WHAT'S THAT ... ?  YOU WANT ME TO
               TAKE THE KNIFE AWAY... AND BREAK
               HIS ELBOW... ?

     CIRCLING ...

     RIGGS, WATCHING THEM, HIS EYES BEGINNING TO DANCE ...
     BREATHING SLOW AND EVEN...

                         RIGGS
               BUT THAT WOULD BE EXCRUCIATINGLY
               PAINFUL ...

     SOMETHING INSIDE RIGGS IS GEARING UP ... THE OTHERS CAN
     PERHAPS SENSE IT, THEIR SMILES FALTER A BIT,  THEY  CROUCH,
     COMBAT-READY...
     RIGGS, EYES BLAZING ...

                         RIGGS
               AND IF I SEPARATED THE FAT ONE'S
               SHOULDER... HE'D PROBABLY SCREAM...

     NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.  WE KNOW FROM THE LOOK IN RIGGS' EYES
     HE'S NUTS.  HE WANTS THE FIGHT, BADLY, ALL FOUR OF THEM
     AT ONCE ...

     AND THEN PUNK #1 SPRINGS...
     BIG MISTAKE.

     NEEDLESS TO SAY, MINCEMEAT IS MADE OF THE  FOUR  MEDDLESOME
     DOG-TORTURERS.

     THE BEACH IS LITTERED WITH THEIR WRITHING FORMS AS RIGGS
     DOES, FINALLY, WHAT HE SET OUT TO DO:

     UNTIES THE DOG.

     STARTS TO GO.
     AS HE DOES, HE PATS HIS SHIRT ...

     PATS HIS JEANS ... REALIZES HIS WALLET HAS FLOWN FREE
     DURING THE FRACAS.

     SCOOPS TO RETRIEVE IT FROM ITS RESTING PLACE ON THE  SAND,

     WHERE IT LIES OPEN, AND AS IT LIES OPEN, YES,  FOLKS,  THAT
     IS A BADGE WE SEE.

     RIGGS, WE REALIZE, IS AN OFFICER OF THE LAW.

     HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE AND NOTICES THE COLLIE, SEATED.
     FROWNS:

                         RIGGS
               OKAY, SKEEZIX.  GO ON.  GET OUTTA
               HERE.

     HE BEGINS TO WALK AWAY.  THE DOG REMAINS CLOSE AT HIS
     HEELS.  FOLLOWING HIM.

                        RIGGS
               NO, NO.  DON'T FOLLOW ME.  I'M AN
               ASSHOLE.  GO AWAY.

     THE DOG SITS OBEDIENTLY AND RIGGS WALKS AWAY.
     HE CAN'T HELP IT, LOOKS BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER...

     SEES THE DOG WATCHING HIM WITH A BESEECHING EXPRESSION.
     PITIFUL.

                         RIGGS
               AW, SHIT.

     HE SIGNALS THE DOG.

                         RIGGS
               AWRIGHT.  MOVE IT.  LET'S GO.

     THE COLLIE BARKS HAPPILY AND DASHES TOWARD HIM THROUGH
     THE SURF, KICKING UP SAND AND WATER.

     AS THEY SHUFFLE OFF AGAINST THE PALM-LINED SKYLINE, WE
     HEAR, SUPERED, RIGGS' VOICE.

                         RIGGS (V.O.)
               SO.  YOU LIVE IN THE AREA?  WHAT'S
               YOUR MAJOR ... ?

     AND SO ON AS WE ...

     PALM TREES CAST SHADOWS  ON  THE  LAWN.  TOYS,  LOTS  OF  THEM,
     LITTERED ACROSS THE LAWN.  A BIG WHEEL, A G.I. JOE FIGURE.
     CHRISTMAS LIGHTS  ARE  STRUNG  ACROSS  THE  EAVES.

     A REAL GUN, A .38  POLICE  SPECIAL,  DANGLING  IN  ITS  HOL-
     STER FROM THE BACK OF A CHAIR.  NEXT TO IT -- A REAL
     BADGE, GLEAMING  IN  THE  LIGHT.  IT  IDENTIFIES  ITS  OWNER
     AS LAPD ROBBERY/HOMICIDE.

     A BIRTHDAY CAKE COMES INTO FRAME.  A SET OF MATRONLY
     HANDS PLACES IT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF --

8    DETECTIVE ROGER  MURTAUGH                                      8

     SEATED IN THE  BATHTUB.  HE  GROANS,  THROWS  A  TOWEL  OVER
     HIMSELF, AND MUTTERS IN MOCK INDIGNATION:  ROGER IS
     TOUGH:  AN OLD-FASHIONED FIGHTER, WEARS HIS PAST LIKE A
     SCAR.  PIERCING EYES; CYNICAL.  HE IS SURROUNDED BY HIS
     FAMILY; WIFE AND THREE  CHILDREN,  NAMES  AND  AGES  AS
     FOLLOWS:  TRISH:  ROUGHLY  THIRTY-EIGHT.  SHE  USED  TO  BE   A

     AGE  SEVEN.  EYES  LIKE  SAUCERS.   ADORABLE.   RIANNE:
     HEARTBREAKER STUFF, SEVENTEEN.  TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY
     FOLKS.  THE CAKE IS A REAL BEAUTY.

                         CARRIE
               MAKE A WISH, DADDY.

                         RIANNE
               GO FOR IT, DAD.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (SMILES)
               GO FOR IT, HUH...?  OKAY, I'LL
               GO FOR IT.

     HE BLOWS OUT THE CANDLES.  APPLAUSE.  HIS   GAZE   LINGERS
     ON -- THE CAKE.  OR RATHER, THE MESSAGE SCRAWLED ATOP IT
     IN ICING:           WELCOME TO THE BIG 50

     THE PRESENTS ARRIVE.

                                               CUT  TO:

9    EXT. SIMI VALLEY - MORNING                                    9

     THE SCORCHED LANDSCAPE STRETCHES OUT  BENEATH  A  LATTICE-
     WORK OF HIGH-TENSION POWER LINES.  ONLY SCRUB GRASS
     GROWS HERE. RUSTED RAILROAD TRACKS  WANDER  INTO  THE  DIS-
     TANCE, AND NESTLED BESIDE THEM, LIKE THE  LAST  STOP  BE-
     FORE DEATH -- SITS A LONELY  TRAILER  HOME.  BATTERED  TV
     ANTENNA.  A DIRT YARD WHICH HOUSES A BEAT-UP PICKUP
     TRUCK. DEAD GARDEN  SPROUTING  WEEDS.  THE  GROUND  BEGINS
     TO TREMBLE ... LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE, RATTLING THE POWER
     POLES, AS, WITHOUT WARNING -- AN  EXPRESS  TRAIN  BLASTS
     BY CAMEPA AND STREAKS PAST THE TRAILER  AT  SEVENTY  MILES
     AN HOUR.

10   INT. TRAILER HOME                                            10

     NOW WE ARE INSIDE, THE RUMBLING FAINTER ... AND  WE  ARE
     LOOKING AT A TIRED, CHISELED FACE.  ETCHED  WITH  LINE  AND
     SHADOW. EYES CLOSED, AS THE  SHADOWS  FROM  THE  SPEEDING
     TRAIN STROBE ACROSS DETECTIVE SERGEANT MARTIN RIGGS.
     MORNING IS NOT A GOOD TIME FOR  RIGGS.  THE  CLOCK  RADIO
     SUDDENLY BLARES TO LIFE:  "SILVER BELLLLS ... IT'S
     CHRISTMAS TIIIME IN THE CITY..."  RIGGS SNAPS AWAKE
     INSTANTLY.  ALERT.  TENSE.  FACE BATHED IN SWEAT.

11   ANOTHER ANGLE

     HE IS NOT ALONE.  IN THE DOORWAY SITS A THOROUGHLY
     LOVEABLE BLACK LABRADOR.  SITTING  STOCK  STILL.  STAR3.NG
     AT RIGGS, WATCHING HIM  SLEEP.  TAIL  GOING  THUMP-THUMP-
     THUMP ON THE CARPET.

     RIGGS SITS UP.  STARES AT THE DOG.

                         RIGGS
               SAM, TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY ...
               OF THE REST OF MY LIFE.

     HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE.  INHALES.
     COUGHS AND HACKS.

     THE TRAIN THROBS BY OUTSIDE, RATTLING HIS SKULL ...

                                            CUT TO:

12   INT. MURTAUGH HOME - SAME TIME                               12

     AND IT IS A TYPICAL MORNING FOR DETECTIVE ROGER MURTAUGH.
     CHAOS. THE  TELEVISION  BLARES.  YOUNG  CARRIE  MURTAUGH
     WAILS LIKE A BANSHEE.  HER BROTHER NICK TELLS HER TO
     SHUT UP. TRISH MURTAUGH IS BURNING  EGGS  IN  THE  KITCHEN.
     ROGER MURTAUGH ENTERS THEN, FIXING  HIS  TIE.  THE  FOLLOW-
     ING DIALOGUE IS FAST AND FURIOUS, TOSSED  OVER  THE  SHOUL-
     DER AS MURTAUGH SCURRIES TO AND FRO,  GETTING  DRESSED:

                         MURTAUGH
               HONEY, WHAT'S THIS ON MY TIE?

     SHE  LOOKS.

                         TRISH
               AN  UGLY   SPOT?

                         MURTAUGH
               THANKS.  SHARP AS A PIN.

                         TRISH
               I'M THINKING OF GOING ON 'JEOPARDY.'

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON COOKING.

                         TRISH
               THANKS.  I LOVE YOU, TOO.

               HEY, MAN.  HEY!

                         RIGGS
               WAIT, WAIT ... SHUTUP.  I'M
               LOSIN  COUNT.  WHERE  WAS  I?   OH,
               YEAH...
                    (CONTINUES   TO
                     PEEL  OFF  THE
                     BILLS)
               ... EIGHT,   NINETY,   NINETY-FIVE,
               NINETY-SIX, NINETY-SEVEN...
                    (DIGS INTO HIS
                     POCKET FOR
                     LOOSE CHANGE)
               ... NINETY-SEVEN-FIFTY.      SIXTY.
               SEVENTY-FIVE.  OKAY, THERE'S
               NINETY-EIGHT  DOLLARS  AND   TWENTY
               CENTS...

     HE IS ABOUT TO CHECK HIS OTHER POCKET FOR CHANGE WHEN
     DRUG DEALER ONE STOPS HIM.

                         DRUG DEALER ONE
               FORGET  IT,   DUMBSHIT.

                         RIGGS
               C'MON.  I'M ALMOST THERE.  GIMME
               A MINUTE  TO  --

                        DRUG DEALER ONE
               ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND, YOU STUPID
               FUCK!  ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND!

     RIGGS IS FLOORED.  HE CAN'T BELIEVE HIS EARS.

                        RIGGS
               OH, JESUS ... I CAN'T AFFORD THAT.
               NOT ON MY SALARY.
                    (BEAT)
               LOOK... LET'S DO THIS INSTEAD ...
                    (PULLS OUT HIS
                     WALLET)
               I TAKE YOUR COMPLETE STASH, OKAY?
               I TAKE IT ALL.  FOR FREE.  AND
               YOU ASSHOLES GO TO JAIL.

     AS HE SAYS THIS, HE FLIPS OPEN HIS WALLET AND SHOWS HIS
     BADGE.  THE DRUG DEALERS AT FIRST LOOK STARTLED, THEN
     DISBELIEVING.

                         RIGGS
               I COULD READ YOU  YOUR  RIGHTS,
               BUT ... NAH.  YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT
               YOUR RIGHTS ARE.

                         DRUG  DEALER  ONE
               FUCK YOU, MAN.  THAT BADGE AIN'T
               REAL.  AND YOU AIN'T REAL.

                         DRUG  DEALER  TWO
               BUT YOU'RE SURE AS HELL ONE
               CRAZY FUCK!

     RIGGS' EYES BEGIN TO BLAZE.  HIS NOSTRILS FLARE.  LIKE
     A MANIAC, HE LUNGES AT DRUG  DEALER  TWO.

                         RIGGS
               YOU CALLIN' ME CRAZY!?  YOU
               THINK I'M CRAZY!  YOU, WANNA SEE
               CRAZY?  I'LL SHOW YOU CRAZY!
               THIS IS  CRAZY!

     RIGGS THEN PROCEEDS TO SLAP AND PUMMEL THE DRUG DEALER
     IN THE MANNER OF THE "THREE STOOGES"... COMPLETE WITH
     "WOO-WOO" SOUND  EFFECTS.

     BUT HE ENDS THE ROUTINE BY PULLING A NINE-MILLIMETER
     BARETTA FROM BEHIND HIS BACK AND PRESSING IT AGAINST
     THE NECK OF DRUG DEALER TWO.

                         RIGGS
               THAT'S A REAL BADGE.  I'M A REAL
               COP. AND THIS IS  A  REAL  GUN.
                    (TO THE OTHER TWO
                     DRUG DEALERS)
               FACE DOWN ON THE GROUND.  ARMS
               AND LEGS OUT.  DO IT NOW!

     DEALER ONE AND THREE BEGIN TO FOLLOW ORDERS      BUT RIGGS
     SEES A FLICKER IN THEIR EVES THAT          HIM TO TROUBLE.

      HE SPINS AROUND -- A FOURTH DRUG DEALER  IS  BEHIND  HIM
      WITH A SHOTGUN.  THE SHOTGUN EXPLODES.  RIGGS DUCKS,
      ALLOWING DRUG DEALER TWO TO TAKE THE  FULL  FORCE  OF  THE
      'BLAST IN THE  FACE.

      RIGGS ROLLS IN THE SAWDUST          FIRING HIS BERETTA.
      DEALER FOUR TAKES A BULLET BETWEEN THE EYES.
      DEALER TWO NOW HAS AN AUTOMATIC RIFLE IN HIS HAND.
      IT CHATTERS IN RIGGS' DIRECTION.  SAWDUST AND PINE
      NEEDLES FLY IN THE AIR -- BUT RIGGS IS ABLE TO BLOW
      HIM AWAY.

      ONE MORE DRUG DEALER LEFT.  RIGGS CAN'T FIND HIM.
      HIS EYES DART IN ALL DIRECTIONS.  WHERE IS HE?!

      BEHIND RIGGS, THAT'S WHERE!  HE  PRESSES  A  REVOLVER  TO
      THE BACK OF RIGGS' HEAD, TAKING RIGGS' BARETTA FROM
      HIM AND TUCKING IT INTO HIS BELT.

      THAT'S WHEN:

19B   FIVE NARCOTICS OFFICERS                               19B

      COME RUNNING FROM THEIR STAKEOUT  POSITIONS  AROUND  THE
      LOT. BUT THEY STOP SHORT WHEN  THEY  SEE  THAT  RIGGS  IS
      BEING HELD WITH A GUN POINTED TO HIS HEAD.

      THE DRUG DEALER BEGINS TO MOVE WITH  RIGGS  TOWARD  A  VAN
      PARKED NEARBY.

                          RIGGS
                     (TO OFFICERS)
                SHOOT HIM!  SHOOT HIM!

                          DRUG DEALER
                     (TO RIGGS)
                SHUT  UP!

                          RIGGS
                     (TO DRUG DEALER)
                FUCK YOU!
                     (TO OFFICERS)
                SHOOT HIM!  SHOOT HIM!

     THE NARCOTICS OFFICERS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  THEY
     ARE FRUSTRATED.  HELPLESS.  IMMOBILIZED.

     RIGGS SEES THE VAN LOOMING  UP.  THE  VAN  MEANS  DEFEAT.
     THE VAN MEANS DISGRACE. THE  VAN  MEANS  VICTORY  FOR  THE
     BAD GUYS, AND WE KNOW THAT RIGGS  WOULD  RATHER  DIE  THAN
     BE THE INSTRUMENT OF THE DEALER'S ESCAPE.

19C  CLOSE ON RIGGS AND DRUG DEALER                       19C

     THE VEINS ARE POPPING OUT IN RIGGS' NECK.  THE DRUG
     DEALER IS GETTING NERVOUS AND PANICKY.  HIS GUN HAND
     IS TREMBLING.  THE BARREL OF THE GUN JIGGLES AGAINST
     THE BACK OF  RIGGS'  HEAD.

                         RIGGS
                    (TO DRUG DEALER)
               DO IT, ASSHOLE.  PULL THE TRIGGER.
               PULL THE TRIGGER.

                         DRUG DEALER
               SHUT THE FUCK UP!

     THEY MOVE CLOSER TO THE VAN.  THE NARCOTICS OFFICERS
     HAVE THEIR GUNS POISED FOR ACTION, BUT DON'T DARE USE
     THEM.

                         DRUG DEALER
                    (TO OFFICERS)
               GUNS DOWN!  GUNS DOWN!

                         RIGGS
                    (TO OFFICERS)
               SHOOT HIM!  KILL HIM!
                    (TO DEALER)
               PULL THE TRIGGER!
                    (TO OFFICERS).
               WASTE HIM!
                    (TO DEALER)
               SHOOT ME!
                    (TO OFFICERS)
               KILL HIM!!

     THE DEALER IS SO FREAKED NOW THAT HIS GRIP ON RIGGS
     SLIPS MOMENTARILY -- AND RIGGS SEES HIS OPENING.

     HE SPINS.  KICKS THE DEALER IN THE GROIN.  DISLOCATES
     HIS ARM -- SENDING TLIE GUN  FLYING.  RIGGS RETRIEVES HIS
     BARETTA FROM THE DEALER'S BELT  AND  SHOVES THE BARREL
     INTO THE DEALER'S FACE.

     RIGGS' ENTIRE BODY QUAKES  WITH  RAGE.  HIS FINGER BEGINS
     TO SQUEEZE BACK ON THE  TRIGGER.  HE  WANTS TO KILL THE
     GUY SO BAD HE CAN TASTE IT... AND  YET,  HE      DOESN'T DO IT.

     THE OTHER OFFICERS ARRIVE AND STEP BETWEEN RIGGS AND
     THE DEALER.

     RIGGS TURNS AWAY.  BREATLIING HARD.  ADRENALIN PUMPING.
     HE TUCKS THE BARETTA INTO HIS BELT, THEN NOTICES THAT
     HIS HAND IS COVERED WITH THE SPILLED BLOOD OF ONE OF
     THE DRUG DEALERS.

     IT GIVES RIGGS  PAUSE.  FOR A MOMENT, HE JUST LOOKS AT
     IT.

     HOLD ON RIGGS.   VERY CLOSE.  AND THE LOOK IN HIS EYES.

     POLICE HAVE SELDOM LOOKED THIS BUSY.  YES, THERE ARE
     RINGING PHONES.  YES, THERE ARE CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS.
     YES, IT LOOKS LIKE A CIRCUS.  AND HERE COMES CAPTAIN OF
     DETECTIVES ED MURPHY, MOVING LIKE AN AFTER-BREAKFAST
     JUGGERNAUT.  BEHIND HIM, A YOUNG WOMAN RUSHES TO KEEP UP.
     THE POLICE PSYCHOLOGIST, NO LESS.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               I WANT MARTIN RIGGS PULLED FROM
               DUTY.

                         MURPHY

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               NO.  NO???  CAPTAIN, HE WALKED
               INTO THE LINE OF FIRE.

                         MURPHY
               VERY BRAVE INDIVIDUAL,  DON'T
               YOU THINK... ?

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               THIS IS UTTER BULLSHIT.

                         MURPHY
               OH, IS IT?  FORGIVE ME.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               MARTIN RIGGS IS A COP WITH  A
               DEATH WISH.

     MURPHY SHOOTS HER AN INCREDULOUS  LOOK.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YOU CAN QUOTE ME.  IT HAPPENS TO
               BE MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION.

                         MURPHY
               UM... GOOD OPINION. SEE  YOU
               TOMORROW.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               CAPTAIN...

                         MURPHY
               LOOK, DOC, YOU'RE  WAY  OFF.  WAY
               OFF.  KNOW WHAT I THINK?  I THINK
               RIGGS IS PULLING FOR A PSYCHO
               PENSION.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               OH, DO YOU?

                         MURPHY
               YEAH.  I AM SURE YOU'RE AWARE THE
               DEPARTMENT OFFERS  A  DISABILITY
               STRESS PENSION --

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YES, I'M AWARE --

                         MURPHY
               -- EXCEPT WE DON'T OFFER  IT  TO
               EVERYBODY, ONLY COPS WHO SEEM TO
               SUFFER FROM

               -- FROM ABNORMAL STRESS,  YES,  I
               KNOW.  OR  SUICIDAL  TENDENCIES.

                         MURPHY
               GIVE THE LADY A CIGAR.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YOU THINK RIGGS IS PLAYING A GAME?

                         MURPHY
               SURE. HE  WANTS  THE  CASH.  SEEN
               IT A HUNDRED  TIMES.  HE'LL  COME
               AROUND.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               SIR, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT ...  I
               THINK THAT'S A DANGEROUS ATTITUDE
               TO TAKE. MAY I  REMIND  YOU  THAT
               HIS WIFE OF ELEVEN YEARS WAS
               RECENTLY KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT,
               AND

                         MURPHY
               I KNOW ALL ABOUT RIGGS, DOC.  HE'S
               A TOUGH BASTARD.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
                    (INTENSE)
               HE IS ON THE EDGE.  HE MAY BE
               PSYCHOTIC.

                         MURPHY
               BUNCH OF PSYCH BULLSHIT-  LOOK,
               CAN I PEE NOW?

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE
               BY LEAVING HIM IN THE FIELD.
               HE'S   SUICIDAL.

                         MURPHY
               END OF DISCUSSION.  WE'RE GONNA
               WAIT.  AND THEN, IF HE OFFS
               HIMSELF ... WELL, THEN WE'LL KNOW
               I WAS WRONG.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YES, SIR.  THEN WE'LL KNOW.

     RAIN  SWEEPS  IN  OFF  THE  DESERT.  COLD.  DRENCHING.  RIGGS
     WALKS SLOWLY TOWARD HIS TRAILER HOME, HEAD DOWN.  THE
     RAIN BEATS ON HIM.  HE  DOESN'T  NOTICE.  UNDER  HIS  ARM  HE
     CARRIES A LARGE CARDBOARD BOX.

28   INT. RIGGS' TRAILER - SAME TIME                                 28

     RIGGS ENTERS, SOAKING WET.  SWITCHES ON THE LAMP.
     DEPRESSING.  JAKE  APPEARS,  TAIL  A-THUMP.  TONGUE   WAGGING
     DOGGISHLY.  RIGGS REACHES ATOP THE REFRIGERATOR, GRABS
     A BAG OF PEANUTS.
     OPENS IT, TOSSES IT TO THE DOG.

                         RIGGS
               SAM, EVERY DAY ... IN EVERY WAY ...
               I'M GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.

     OPENS THE BOX AND  REMOVES  ITS  CONTENTS.  BRAND  NEW  COLOR
     TELEVISION.  PLUGS IT IN.  SWITCHES IT ON.  SITS DOWN
     WITH A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.  DRINKS.  ON THE SCREEN, THE
     GRINCH STEALS CHRISTMAS FROM THE RESIDENTS OF WHOVILLE.

     RIGGS OPENS A DRAWER BESIDE HIM, AND TAKES OUT A BOTTLE
     OF SLEEPING PILLS. PICKS IT  UP.  AS  HE  DOES  --  THE  SOUND
     OF THE TELEVISION FADES OUT -- SILENCE, DEAD SILENCE...
     AS RIGGS ROLLS THE BOTTLE IN HIS FINGERS.  SLOWLY,
     THOUGHTFULLY, UNSCREWS THE CAP ... DUMPS THEM ON THE TABLE.
     RUNS HIS  FINGERS  THROUGH  THEM.  CLICK...  CLICK...  STARES.
     MESMERIZED.  RAIN BEATS ON THE WINDOW.

     A ZOO.  A SIGN READS METRO ROBBERY/HOMICIDE.

     ROGER MURTAUGH SITS AT HIS DESK, LOST IN THOUGHT.
     BEHIND HIM, MCCASKEY, CLASS THREE DETECTIVE.  HE TALKS
     TO MURTAUGH:

                         MCCASKEY
               SEE, YOU'RE BEHIND THE TIMES,
               SARGE.  GUYS IN THE EIGHTIES
               AREN'T TOUGH.  THEY'RE SENSITIVE
               PEOPLE.  THEY SHOW EMOTIONS AROUND
               WOMEN AND SHIT LIKE THAT.
                    (BEAT)
               I THINK I'M AN EIGHTIES MAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               HOW YOU FIGURE?

                         MCCASKEY
               LAST NIGHT:  I CRIED IN BED, SO
               HOW'S THAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               WERE YOU WITH A  WOMAN?
                         MCCASKEY
               NO, I WAS ALONE, WHY THE FUCK YOU
               THINK I WAS CRYING?

                         MURTAUGH
               SOUNDS LIKE AN EIGHTIES MAN TO ME.

     ANOTHER DETECTIVE ENTERS.  RAIL-THIN, NOSE LIKE A BEAK.
     HIS NAME IS BURKE.

     BEHIND HIM IN THE DOOR FRAME WE SEE A FAT COP PASS BY
     DOWN THE HALL, WALKING BACKWARDS; A BEAT, AND THEN HE  IS
     FOLLOWED BY FOUR MORE COPS SINGING THE WORLD'S  SHITTIEST
     RENDITION OF "IT CAME UPON A MIDNIGHT CLEAR."  IT  SOUNDS
     LIKE PIGS MATING.

     BURKE APPROACHES MURTAUGH:

                         BURKE
               GOT SOME NEWS ON THE LLOYD CASE,
               ROG.

                         MURTAUGH

               YOU READY FOR THIS?  THEY'RE NOT
               CALLING IT SUICIDE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT?

                         BURKE

                         MURTAUGH
               BRILLIANT.  THERE WAS AN OPEN
               BOTTLE ON HER TABLE.

                         BURKE
               RIGHT, RIGHT.  THAT'S NOT THE
               SURPRISE.  SURPRISE IS SOMEONE

32   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             32

     ACROSS THE ROOM, A DETECTIVE TAKES OFF HIS GUN AND
     SLINGS THE HOLSTER ACROSS HIS CHAIR.  AS HE EXITS FRAME
     -- PAN TO REVEAL:  MARTIN RIGGS AS HE ENTERS THE SQUAD
     ROOM.  SHUFFLES FROM FOOT TO FOOT, LOOKING LOST.  LIGHTS
     A SMOKE.

33   ACROSS ROOM                                               33

     MURTAUGH SLINGS ON A JACKET.  TURNS TO GO.  NOTICES
     RIGGS.

34   MURTAUGH'S POV                                            34

     RIGGS RESEMBLES A BAG PERSON.  UNSHAVEN, LIMP DIRTY
     HAIR, GRIMY LEATHER JACKET.

35   BACK TO SCENE                                             35

     HE FROWNS, SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               MCCASKEY, IF MY WIFE CALLS, TELL
               HER LATE DINNER.

                         BURKE
               HO, ROG-  I'M NOT THROUGH YET.
               I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU TWO MORE
               THINGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               SHOOT.

     HE IS STILL LOOKING AT RIGGS, WHO IS SLOWLY WANDERING
     FROM DESK TO DESK, SMOKING -- STOPPING NEAR THE DESK WITH
     THE HOLSTERED GUN.

                         BURKE
               FIRST, CONDITION OF THE SHEETS AND
               MATTRESS INDICATE SOMEONE WAS IN
               BED WITH AMANDA LLOYD JUST BEFORE
               SHE DIED.  THAT'S A.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S B?

                         BURKE
               B IS, I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU
               YOU'RE BREAKING IN A NEW PARTNER
               ON THIS.

     NOW MURTAUGH IS EYEBALLING RIGGS.  CAUTIOUS.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (DISTRACTED)
               I DON'T WORK PARTNERS.

                         BURKE
               YOU DO NOW.  C.I.T. TRANSFER, SOME
               BURNOUT THEY WANT YOU TO KEEP ON
               A LEASH.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, PERFECT.  CAN I TRADE IN MY
               LIFE FOR A NEW ONE?

     AT WHICH POINT, ACROSS THE ROOM, RIGGS REMOVES THE HOL-
     STERED GUN AND HEFTS IT, CURIOUSLY.  SUDDENLY ALL HELL
     BREAKS LOOSE:

                         MURTAUGH
               GUN !!

     HE BOLTS LIKE A CHEETAH.

     COPS DIVE FOR COVER, A SECRETARY SHRIEKS, AND MURTAUGH
     GOES PLOWING THROUGH THE SQUAD ROOM LIKE AN EXPRESS
     TRAIN, BLOWING PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY -- COPS GRABBING
     FOR THEIR HOLSTERS -- RIGGS, MEANWHILE, LOOKING AROUND
     FRANTICALLY, HE'S TRYING TO FIND THE GUY WITH THE GUN
     WHO IS, OF COURSE, HIMSELF.

     MURTAUGH TAKES A FLYING LEAP      SAILS ACROSS
     THE DESK, GOING FOR  THE  GLORY   AND RIGGS, IN THE
     BLINK OF AN EYE,  SIMPLY  DUCKS   AND FLIPS MURTAUGH
     NEATLY OVER ONE SHOULDER.  THERE  IS A HIDEOUS CRASH
     OF BREAKING GLASS AND OVERTURNING FURNITURE.  OUCH...
     MCCASKEY, MEANWHILE, SCREAMS TO BURKE:

                         MCCASKEY
               WHAT THE SHIT IS GOING ON?

     BURKE SIGHS, SHAKES  HIS  HEAD:

     HE HOLDS THE FLAME RIGHT UNDER JOSHUA'S HAND.  SEARING
     IT.  MENDEZ LOOKS ON, A TRIFLE PALE.

     AS FOR JOSHUA, HE MAKES NO SOUND AT ALL.  SIMPLY STANDS,

                    (RUBS  HIS  EYES)
               I'M VERY OLD ...
                    (SIGHS)
               ... GOD HATES ME, THAT'S WHAT
               IT IS.

                         RIGGS
               HATE HIM BACK.  WORKS FOR ME.

     HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE.

                                                CUT TO:

41   INT. BANK  BUILDING  -  DAY                            41

     DICK LLOYD'S OFFICE:  EVERYTHING  ABOUT  IT  LOOKS  STARCHED
     AND PERFECT. IN  THE  B.G.,  BANK  EMPLOYEES  SHUTTLE  BETWEEN
     DESKS, BUILDING  AND  TOPPLING  EMPIRES.  DICK  LLOYD  PACES
     BACK AND FORTH. HE IS THE  MAN  WE  SAW  EARLIER  IN  AMANDA'S
     PLIOTOGRAPH, STANDING NEXT TO  MURTAUGH.  NOW  HE  LOOKS  LIKE
     SHIT. HE ADDRESSES RIGGS  AND  MURTAUGH,  WHO  ARE  SEATED  IN
     THE  OFFICE.
                         LLOYD
               MURDER ...  BUT  I  THOUGHT  ...

                         MURTAUGH
               POISONED.  EVEN IF SHE HADN'T
               JUMPED ... SHE'D STILL BE DEAD.

                         LLOYD
               JESUS.
                    (BEAT)
               JESUS,  I  CAN'T  TAKE -------.

     HE SITS, STARING OUT THE WINDOW.  A BROKEN MAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               DICK, WHY DID YOU CALL ME
               YESTERDAY?

                         LLOYD
                    (VERY  FAR  AWAY)
               CALLED YOU...?  YEAH.  THAT'S
               RIGHT ... I HEARD YOU WERE WORKING
               OUT HERE ... I WANTED  YOU  TO  FIND
               HER  FOR  ME,  ROGER.  TAKE  HER

                         MURTAUGH
               OUT OF WHAT?

                         LLOYD
               SHE DID MOVIES, ROGER ... NAKED
               MOVIES ... SAW ONE OF THEM......  SAW
               MY LITTLE BABY ... SMILING......  SHE
               DID IT ... WITH  A  WOMAN.  SHE    WAS
               ON TOP OF  A  WOMAN,  ROGER-...!

                         MURTAUGH
               EASY, DICK.

     LLOYD TURNS, FACING THEM.  INTENSE:

                         LLOYD
               I WANT A PROMISE.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU OWE ME.  YOU KNOW YOU DO.

                         MURTAUGH
               YES.  I KNOW THAT.

                         LLOYD
               WHEN YOU FIND WHO  DID  IT,  I  WANT
               YOU TO KILL THEM.  IF IT'S MORE
               THAN ONE, I WANT YOU TO KILL ALL OF
               THEM.  MAKE THEM SQUIRM FIRST, TAKE
               YOUR TIME ... AND FUCKING KILL THEM.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M A POLICE OFFICER, DICK.

                         LLOYD
               FORGET THE LAW.  IT'S EASY TO DO.
               YOU OWE ME.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (PAUSE; THEN)
               WE HAVE TO GO NOW.

     LLOYD DOES NOT LOOK UP.  RIGGS AND MURTAUGH HEAD FOR THE
     DOOR.

                         LLOYD
               I KNOW YOU CAN, ROGER.  YOU KILL
               THEM. YOU  DO  THAT.

     THE COPS EXIT.  THE DOOR SHUTS.

42   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                              42

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH HEAD IOR THE CAR.  RIGGS TAKES OUT A
     PACK OF CIGARETTES.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU GONNA SMOKE IN THE CAR?

                         RIGGS
               THINKING ABOUT IT.

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC.

     HE PUTS THE TOP DOWN.
     RIGGS TAKES OUT A CIGARETTE, STARTS TO PUT IT IN HIS
     MOUTH.  STOPS.

                         RIGGS
               WHOOPS.  SHIT.

     HE REPLACES IT IN THE PACK, TAKES ANOTHER.  MURTAUGH
     LOOKS AT HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THAT ONE?

     RIGGS POINTS TO THE TIP OF THE REPLACED CIGARETTE.  WE
     NOTICE TWO THINGS:  A)  IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT FIFTY
     YEARS OLD; AND  B) THERE IS A TINY RED MARK, CIRCLING THE
     FILTER.

                         RIGGS
               THIS ONE IS THE LAST CIGARETTE
               I'LL EVER SMOKE.
               TRICK I LEARNED FROM  MY  DAD.  I
               SMOKE ALL I WANT, BUT WHEN I SMOKE
               THIS ONE ... I'M THROUGH.

                         MURTAUGH
               BRILLIANT.  GET IN THE CAR.

                         RIGGS
               WANT ME TO DRIVE?

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE SUICIDAL, REMEMBER?

                         RIGGS
               ANYONE WHO DRIVES IN LOS ANGELES
               IS SUICIDAL.

     THEY GET IN.  MURTAUGH HEAVES A SIGH, STARES BLEAKLY OUT
     THE WINDOW.  A MOMENT, THEN RIGGS SAYS:

                         RIGGS
               HE SAID YOU OWED  HIM.  WHAT  DID
               HE MEAN?

                         MURTAUGH
               WE SERVED TOGETHER  IN  '65.  HE
               SAVED MY LIFE IN THE LA DRANG
               VALLEY.  TOOK A BAYONET  IN  THE
               LUNG.

                         RIGGS
               THAT WAS NICE OF HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               I THOUGHT SO.

     THE RADIO SQUAWKS. MURTAUGH  TURNS  IT  UP.

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS GREAT.  I LOVE THIS JOB.

                         MURTAUGH
               STOW IT.

43   EXT. CITY INTERSECTION - DAY                            43

     A BUILDING, TEN STORIES HIGH.  ON THE LEDGE, A LONE MAN
     POISED HIGH ABOVE THE STREET.  BENEATH HIM, A CROWD HAS
     GATHERED.  A POLICE CAR.  A SEARCHLIGHT.  A CROWD OF
     OFFICE WORKERS, RUBBER-NECKING TO BEAT THE BAND.  ONE OR
     TWO KIDS YELL, "JUMP, JUMP."

     MURTAUGH'S CAR GLIDES TO THE CURB.  THE DOORS BURST OPEN
     AND THE TWO PARTNERS EMERGE.  A PATROL COP APPROACHES.

                         PATROL  COP
               HEY, SARGE, YOU WANNA HANDLE
               THIS?

                         MURTAUGH
               WHERE'S THE PSYCHOLOGIST?

                         PATROL  COP
               SITTING IN TRAFFIC.

                         MURTAUGH
               SWELL.
                    (BEAT)
               WHO'S THE  GUY?

                         PATROL  COP
               SALESMAN NAME OF MACCLEARY.  LEFT
               THE OFFICE PARTY.  WENT UPSTAIRS
               AND WALKED OUT ON THE LEDGE.

                         MURTAUGH
               THINK HE'LL GO?

                         PATROL  COP
               SEEMS SERIOUS ENOUGH.  WHO KNOWS?

     RIGGS CLEARS HIS THROAT.  MURTAUGH TURNS.

                         RIGGS
               I CAN HANDLE THIS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU QUALIFIED TO TALK TO JUMPERS?

                         RIGGS
               I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (RELUCTANT;  THEN)
               OKAY.  YOU'RE ELECTED.
                    (AS RIGGS
                     TURNS TO GO)
               HEY.
                    (AS RIGGS STOPS)
               NO GUNS.  NO KUNG FU.  JUST ...
               BRING HIM IN.

                         RIGGS
               SURE.  BRING HIM IN.

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGHT.

     RIGGS MOVES OFF TOWARD THE BUILDING.  MURTAUGH LOOKS
     AFTER HIM.  WAS THIS A MISTAKE ... ?

44   EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY                                         44

     RIGGS APPEARS ON THE ROOF.  THERE, ABOUT FIVE YARDS AWAY,
     STANDS THE JUMPER.  AGITATED.  BREATHING HARD.

     BELOW IS TEN STORIES OF OPEN SPACE.  THE WIND BLOWS.
     RIGGS NODS TO THE JUMPER.

                         MACCLEARY (JUMPER)
               GO AWAY.

                         RIGGS
               MY NAME IS RIGGS.

                         MACCLEARY
               FUCK OFF.

                         RIGGS
               I CAN'T DO THAT.
                    (BEAT)
               WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

                         MACCLEARY
               LOOK, I KNOW ALL THE PSYCHOLOGY
               BULLSHIT, IT WON'T WORK.

                         RIGGS
               I'M NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST.

                         MACCLEARY
               YEAH?  WHAT ARE YOU?

                         RIGGS
               HOMICIDE COP.

               MINUTES, YOU CAN GO TO WORK.

                         RIGGS
               AT LEAST TELL ME YOUR NAME.  LOOK,
               I GOTTA FILL OUT THE LITTLE PIECE
               OF PAPER.  OKAY?

                         MACCLEARY
                    (SWALLOWS)
               LEN.  LEN MACCLEARY.

                         RIGGS

     RIGGS LEANS OUT FARTHER, PERCHES ON THE LEDGE.  ABSOLUTELY
     CALM.

                         RIGGS
               WHY  ARE  YOU  DOING  THIS?

                         MACCLEARY
               NONE OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS.

                         RIGGS
               FAIR ENOUGH.
                     (PAUSE; THEN)
               I'M COMING OUT.  TAKE IT EASY.

     RIGGS STANDS, STEPS OUT ONTO THE NARROW LEDGE.  HE SEEMS
     UNCONCERNED.

                         MACCLEARY
               DON'T  COME  NEAR  ME!

                         RIGGS
               SSSHHH.  EASY.  I'M JUST GOING TO
               TALK.

                         MACCLEARY

                         RIGGS
               I UNDERSTAND.

     ON THE GROUND BELOW, ROGER MURTAUGH REACTS WITH DISBELIEF.
     HIS PARTNER IS TAKING AN INSANE RISK.  UP ABOVE, RIGGS
     PAUSES.  AROUND HIM THE WIND BLOWS TREACHEROUSLY.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST GUY TO THINK
               OF THIS, YOU KNOW.  EVERYONE'S GOT

                         MACCLEARY
               YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART.

     RIGGS TAKES OUT HIS WALLET, FLASHES IT AT MACCLEARY.

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS HER PICTURE.

     HE TAKES A STEP CLOSER.

                         MACCLEARY
               DON'T TOUCH ME.  I'M NOT DOING
               ANYTHING WRONG.

               MURDERING ANYONE.

                         MACCLEARY
               RIGHT.  ONLY ONE HURT IS ME.

     SNAPS A HANDCUFF ON HIS WRIST.  SNAPS THE OTHER END ONTO
     HIS OWN WRIST.

                         MACCLEARY
               HEY ...

                         RIGGS
               SORRY.
                    (BEAT)
               SEE  THIS  KEY?

     HE HOLDS UP THE KEY TO THE CUFFS.  FLINGS IT OUT INTO
     SPACE.

                         RIGGS
               WE'RE  TOGETHER  ON  THIS.  YOU  CAN
               GO IF YOU  WANT.  BUT  YOU  TAKE  ME
               WITH  YOU.  MAKES  YOU  A  MURDERER.

                         MACCLEARY
               YOU BASTARD.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'LL BE KILLING A COP.

     SILENCE.

                         RIGGS
               I'M GOING INSIDE.  WHAT SAY YOU
               COME WITH ME?

     HE TURNS, STARTS TO EASE ALONG THE LEDGE.  MACCLEARY
     SWALLOWS HARD, SAYS:

                         MACCLEARY
               FUCK YOU, I'M JUMPING.

     AND SUDDENLY RIGGS TURNS ON HIM.  EYES LIKE STEEL.

                         RIGGS
               YOU WANNA JUMP ... ?  YOU REALLY
               WANT TO ... ?
                    (LONG  PAUSE;
                     THEN)
               FINE. LET'S  DO  IT.

     HE STEPS TO THE EDGE.

                        MACCLEARY
              HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ...

                        RIGGS
              YOU ASKED FOR IT.

                        MACCLEARY
              HEY, WAIT A MINUTE ... !

     RIGGS DOES SOMETHING VERY  DRASTIC.  HE  JERKS  THEM  BOTH
     OFF THE LEDGE.  HOLY SHIT.  THE CROWD GASPS.

                         RIGGS
               GERONIMOOOOOO ...

     AS DOWN THEY PLUNGE, ALL TEN STORIES -- TUMBLING AND
     FALLING -- MACCLEARY SHRIEKING LIKE A LUNATIC ... AND
     SUDDENLY, BAM -- !  THEY LAND IN A FIREMAN'S NET.  BOUNCE
     A FEW TIMES. COME TO REST, SAFE  AND  UNHARMED  ...  RIGGS
     ROLLS OVER WITH A SOUR LOOK ON HIS FACE.  COPS SURROUND
     THEM.  MACCLEARY IS A TRIFLE UPSET.

                         MACCLEARY
               GET HIM AWAY FROM ME!!  CUT ME
               LOOSE!!  CRAZY FUCKER TRIED TO
               KILL ME!!  DID YOU SEE THAT??  HE
               TRIED TO KILL  ME!!!

     AND SO ON, SCREAMING AND RANTING --  AS  A  UNIFORMED  COP
     CUTS RIGGS FREE WITH A SET OF CLIPPERS.  RIGGS STANDS
     SHAKILY. STEPS AWAY FROM  THE  NET.  AND  THERE  IS  ROGER
     MURTAUGH.  VISIBLY   UPSET.

     DID I SAY UPSET?  I MEANT ENRAGED.  HE GRABS RIGGS, SLAMS
     HIM AGAINST THE WALL.  TRIES TO GRAB HIS COLLAR.  RIGGS'
     HAND SHOOTS OUT.  LIGHTNING FAST.  STOPS MURTAUGH'S HAND.
     STOPS IT COLD.  THEY STARE INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES.

                         RIGGS
               DON'T ... TOUCH ME.

     MURTAUGH WILL NOT BACK DOWN.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST DO???

                         RIGGS
               I CONTROLLED THE JUMP.  YOU WANTED
               HIM DOWN.  HE'S DOWN.

                         MURTAUGH
               C'MERE.


     HE YANKS RIGGS AROUND THE CORNER, AWAY FROM THE OTHER
     COPS.

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY, TURKEY, NO BULLSHIT.  DO YOU
               WANT  TO  KILL  YOURSELF?

                         RIGGS
               AW, FOR CHRISSAKE ...

                         MURTAUGH
               SHUT UP.  JUST YES OR NO, DO YOU
               WANT TO DIE?  HUH?  YES OR NO?

                         RIGGS
               I GOT THE JOB DONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING THE
               QUESTION!!!

                         RIGGS
                    (ANGRY)
               WHAT DO YOU WANNA HEAR, MAN?  YOU
               WANNA HEAR THAT I GOT A BOTTLE OF
               PILLS IN MY ROOM?  I DO.  EVERY
               DAY I WAKE UP, I LOOK FOR A REASON
               NOT TO TAKE THEM.  DOING THE JOB,
               THAT'S ... THAT'S THE REASON.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT HIM.  NODS.  A MOMENT, THEN:

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU WANT TO DIE.

                         RIGGS
               I'M NOT AFRAID OF IT.

                         MURTAUGH
               HERE.
                    (UNHOLSTERS
                     HIS GUN)
               PILLS ARE TOO SLOW.  USE A GUN.
               USE MY GUN.  GO AHEAD, PAL.

     A PAUSE.   RIGGS LOOKS AT THE GUN.

                         MURTAUGH
               BE MY GUEST.

     HE OFFERS THE GUN TO RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               GO AHEAD.  IF YOU'RE SERIOUS.

     RIGGS SMILES, TAKES THE GUN WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT.  PUTS
     IT TO HIS HEAD.  CLICK -- !  THE HAMMER IS COCKED.
     MURTAUGH AND RIGGS STARE EACH OTHER DOWN.  TENSE.  READING
     EACH  OTHER.

                         RIGGS
               YOU SHOULDN'T TEMPT ME, ROGER.

                         MURTAUGH
               PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH.  BULLET GOES
               IN YOUR EAR, MIGHT NOT KILL YOU.

     MEANWHILE, IN THE B.G., PEDESTRIANS ARE DIVING FOR COVER.
     MURTAUGH AND RIGGS ARE OBLIVIOUS.  RIGGS PUTS THE GUN
     UNDER HIS CHIN.

                         RIGGS
               UNDER THE CHIN'S JUST AS GOOD.

     THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER.  RIGGS' FINGER BEGINS TO
     TIGHTEN ON THE TRIGGER.  TURNS WHITE WITH PRESSURE.
     IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO DO IT.
     AT THE LAST SECOND, MURTAUGH JAMS HIS THUMB IN FRONT OF
     THE HAINMER, AND CLICK
     JESUS ...
     THE HAINMER THUDS AGAINST HIS THUMB.

     MURTAUGH GRABS THE GUN.  STARES AT RIGGS, WILD-EYED.

                         MURTAUGH
               JESUS.  YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO DRAW
               A PSYCHO PENSION.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU'RE REALLY CRAZY ...

                         RIGGS
                    (SMILES  COLDLY)
               SO NOW YOU KNOW.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  NOW I KNOW.

46   INT. POLICE  LINEUP  -  DAY                                46

     THE POLICE PSYCHOLOGIST WE MET EARLIER  IS TALKING ON THE
     TELEPHONE:

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YOU'RE ASKING ME IF HE'S STABLE
               AND I'M TELLING YOU NO.  WE'RE
               TALKING ABOUT A MAN WHO CARVES
               NOTCHES IN HIS GUN BARREL.  ORE
               FOR EACH KILL.  HE BLEW A MAN
               TO PIECES YESTERDAY.  IS THIS
               HELPING?

                                             INTERCUT:

47   ROGER MURTAUGH                                           47

     STANDING AT A PAY PHONE, LISTENING.  HE NODS:

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC.  SO YOU'RE SAYING I
               SHOULD WORRY.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               ARE YOU KIDDING?  THE GUY'S A TIME
               BOMB.  WHEN HE GOES... STAND BACK.

                         MURTAUGH
               THANK YOU, DOCTOR.  YOU'VE BEEN
               VERY HELPFUL.

     HE HANGS UP.  RUBS HIS EYES TIREDLY AND SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT.

                                              CUT TO:

48   INT. MURTAUGH'S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY                    48

     SILENCE.  MURTAUGH FUMES.  RIGGS KEEPS HIS MOUTH SHUT.
     MURTAUGH TAKES HIS ANGER OUT ON THE ROAD:  SLAMMING THE
     BRAKES; SQUEALING AROUND CORNERS, ETC.

     BUT HE CAN'T HOLD IT 'IN.  HE EXPLODES:

                         MURTAUGH
                    (POUNDING HIS FIST
                     AGAINST THE WHEEL)
               IT'S MY  BIRTHDAY,  DAMNIT!  FIFTY
               YEARS OLD TODAY!  FIFTY GODDAMN
               YEARS OLD!  THIRTY YEARS ON THE
               FORCE!  NOT A SCRATCH ON ME!  NOT
               A SCAR!  I GOT A WIFE!  KIDS!
               HOUSE! FISHING  BOAT!  BUT  I  CAN
               KISS ALL THAT GOODBYE,  'CAUSE  MY
               NEW PARTNER'S GOT A DEATH WISH!
               MY FUCKIN' LIFE IS OVER!

                         RIGGS
               ROGER --

                         MURTAUGH
               SHUT UP!  WHY YOU TALKIN' TO ME?!
               I'M NOT HE'RE ANYMORE!  I'M  GONE!
               I'M DEAD!  YOU'RE GONNA SEE TO
               THAT!  YOU WANNA DIE -- AND YOU'RE
               GONNA TAKE ME WITH YOU!

     SILENCE AGAIN.  MURTAUGH GNASHES HIS TEETH.  RIGGS  LOOKS
     AT HIM WITH A VERY SERIOUS EXPRESSION.

                         RIGGS
               I DIDN'T  KNOW  THAT.

                         MURTAUGH
               KNOW WHAT?!

                         RIGGS
               THAT TODAY WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY.
                    (BEAT)
               HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ROGER.  I MEAN
               THAT SINCERELY.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS TAKEN ABACK BY THE GENUINE SOUND OF  AFFEC-
     TION IN RIGGS' VOICE.

                         RIGGS
               I JUST HOPE WE STAY ALIVE LONG
               ENOUGH FOR ME TO BUY YOU A PRESENT.

     RIGGS SAYS THIS WITH A STRAIGHT FACE -- BUT THERE IS
     A PLAYFUL GLINT IN HIS EYE THAT MURTAUGH DOESN'T MISS.
     AND HE LAUGHS OUT LOUD IN SPITE OF HIMSELF.  IT BREAKS
     THE TENSION, AND RIGGS  KNOWS  IT.

                         RIGGS
               WHERE WE GOING?

                         MURTAUGH
               BEVERLY HILLS.
                    (BEAT)
               GOT AN ADDRESS ON AMANDA
               HUNSECKER'S MEAL TICKET.  BUT
               REMEMBER ... THIS GUY ISN'T A
               SUSPECT YET.  WE'RE GONNA
               QUESTION HIM; NOT DAMAGE
               HIM.

     RIGGS RAISES HIS HANDS -- AS IF TO SAY, I'LL BE ON MY
     BEST BEHAVIOR.  MURTAUGH SWINGS THE CAR ONTO SUNSET
     BLVD.

49   EXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOME - TWILIGHT                      49

     THE KIND OF HOUSE THAT I'LL BUY IF THIS MOVIE IS A HUGE
     HIT.  CHROME.  GLASS.  CARVED WOOD.  PLUS AN OUTDOOR
     SOLARIUM:  A GLASS STRUCTURE, LIKE A GREENHOUSE ONLY
     THERE'S A BIG SWIMMING POOL INSIDE.  THIS IS A REALLY
     GREAT PLACE TO HAVE SEX.

50   INT. SOLARIUM                                                50

     THE SWIMMING POOL IS COVERED BY A VINYL TARPAULIN.
     SURROUNDED BY A JUNGLE OF PLANTS.

51   AT POOLSIDE TABLE                                        51

     SITS A VERY RICH PERSON.  HE IS WEARING AN $800 DESIGNER
     ENSEMBLE.  BESIDE HIM, AN ELEGANTLY-APPOINTED SHOTGUN
     LEANS AGAINST THE TABLE.  HE IS ON THE PHONE.

                         RICH GUY
               LISTENS ASSHOLE, YOU GOTTA TELL
               ME THESE THINGS ... YEAH, WE GOT
               A PROBLEM.  MY MARGIN IS COMPLETELY
               FUCKED UP, AND WE GOT ATHLETES
               SNORTING THE SHIT AND PITCHING
               OVER DEAD, HOW'S THAT FOR A
               PROBLEM... ?  YES, I'M HOLDING
               TWO KEYS NOW.  TERRIFIC, CALL
               ME BACK.

                                              CUT TO:

52   EXT. WOODEN GATE - SAME TIME                              52

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH APPROACH THE GATE.  RIGGS TOSSES OUT
     A CIGARETTE.  SUDDENLY --
     THERE IS AN ELECTRIC HUM AND THE GATE GLIDES SOFTLY OPEN,
     ADMITTING A RED HONDA SCOOTER, A DASHING BLONDE BEHIND
     THE WHEEL.  SHE ROARS OFF DOWN THE STREET.

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH EXCHANGE GLANCES.
     THE GATE CLICKS, STARTS TO GLIDE SHUT.

     THE COPS ENTER.

53   EXT. HOUSE WINDOW - SAME TIME                              53

     RIGGS' FACE COMES INTO FRAME, PEERING CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH
     A PLATE GLASS WINDOW.  HE WHISTLES SOFTLY.

                         RIGGS
               TAKE A LOOK.

     MURTAUGH STEPS TO THE WINDOW, LOOKS IN.

54   MURTAUGH'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW                       54

     ENOUGH COCAINE TO SERVICE THE THIRD TIER AT YANKEE
     STADIUM.

     A BLONDE, BIKINI-CLAD WONDER SITS ON THE COUCH, HAPPILY
     SNORTING.  SHE SEES MURTAUGH AND WAVES HILARIOUSLY.
     MAKES COME-HITHER GESTURES.

     MURTAUGH SCOWLS, TURNS TO RIGGS.

                         RIGGS
               I'M THINKING PROBABLE CAUSE.

                         MURTAUGH
               JESUS.  MAYBE I SHOULD CALL FOR
               BACKUP.

                         RIGGS
               WHAT AM I, CHOPPED LIVER?

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT HIM.  SIGHS.

                         MURTAUGH
               NO KILLING.

                         RIGGS
               NO KILLING.

     HE GRINS CHEESILY-

56   EXT. SOLARIUM                                                  56

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH APPROACH  THE  FROSTED  GLASS  DOOR.  THEY
     DRAW THEIR GUNS.

                         MURTAUGH
               NICE AND EASY.

                         RIGGS
               NICE AND EASY.

     MURTAUGH TAKES A DEEP BREATH.  KICKS OPEN THE DOOR.

                         MURTAUGH
               POLICE.  HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

57   INT. SOLARIUM                                                  57

     THE RICH GUY DOES NOT HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.  IN FACT, HE
     HAS ALREADY SNATCHED UP THE SHOTGUN.  HE TRIGGERS A
     BLAST, BLOWS OUT GLASS  NEXT  TO  MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH  DIVES,
     ROLLS, COMES UP IN A COMBAT CROUCH.  BAM --- THE RICH
     GUY TAKES IT IN THE SHOULDER.  SPINS AROUND.  THE GUN
     CLATTERS TO THE GROUND.  RIGGS AND MURTAUGH APPROACH,
     GUNS DRAWN.  THE RICH GUY WRITHES ON THE GROUND, CLUTCH-
     ING HIS SHOULDER.  MURTAUGH SAYS TO RIGGS:

                         MURTAUGH
               SEE HOW EASY THAT WAS?  BOOM.
               STILL ALIVE.  NOW WE TAKE THE GUN
               AWAY ...
                    (HE DOES)
               ... AND WE QUESTION HIM.  KNOW
               WHY WE CAN QUESTION HIM?  BECAUSE
               I GOT HIM IN THE SHOULDER.  I
               DIDN'T BLOW HIM UP OR JUMP OFF A
               BUILDING WITH HIM.

                         RIGGS
               NO FAIR, THE  BUILDING  GUY  LIVED.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHATEVER.  THE POINT IS, NO
               KILLING.

                         RIGGS
               NO KILLING.

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGHT.  PIECE  OF  CAKE.  I'M  VERY
               HAPPY. READ  THE  MAN  HIS  RIGHTS,
               I'LL BE OVER HERE BEING HAPPY.

     UNFORTUNATELY ... AS MURTAUGH SPEAKS, HE DOES NOT  SEE  THE
     MAN ON THE GROUND HAS A HIDEAWAY GUN TUCKED INTO HIS
     WAISTBAND. AS MURTAUGH TALKS, OBLIVIOUS ...  THE  GUY  TAKES
     OUT THE GUN WITH HIS GOOD ARM -- AND  AIMS  DEAD  CENTER-AT
     MURTAUGH'S BACK.  RIGGS, HOWEVER, NOTICES.  AND SPRINGS
     INTO ACTION. BEFORE THE RICH GUY CAN FIRE  ...  RIGGS'  FOOT
     FLASHES OUT LIKE A PILE DRIVER.  CRACK!  THE GUY FLIES
     BACKWARD. LANDS ON TOP  OF  THE  POOL  TARPAULIN.  OOPS.  IT
     PROMPTLY SURROUNDS HIM IN A SUCKING, VICE-LIKE GRIP.
     MURTAUGH DIVES FORWARD AND EXTENDS HIS HAND.  TOO LATE.
     THE VINYL SURROUNDS THE SCREAMING RICH GUY, SUCKS HIM
     BELOW THE SURFACE.  SMOTHERS HIM.

     DRAGS HIM TO THE BOTTOM.  MURTAUGH LOOKS ON, WILD-EYED.
     ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL IS A VINYL TOMB.  MURTAUGH
     DIVES IN. SWIMS TO THE  BOTTOM.  YANKS,  AND  STRAINS,  BUT
     WE ALL KNOW IT'S NO FUCKING USE.  THE  VINYL  STOPS  MOVING.
     MURTAUGH STARES... AND THEN HE GIVES  UP.  SURFACES  AT  THE
     SIDE OF THE POOL, GASPING AND WHEEZING.  RIGGS KNEELS
     DOWN BESIDE HIM.

                         RIGGS
               OOPS.

     MURTAUGH STARES DAGGERS AT HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               HAVE YOU ... EVER...  MET SOMEONE
               YOU DIDN'T KILL... ?

                         RIGGS
               HAVEN'T KILLED YOU YET.

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC, YOU WANT  A  LITTLE  GOLD
               STAR?
                    (LIE PULLS OUT
                     A SOAKED PACK
                     OF CIGARETTES)
               SHIT.

58   EXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOME - LATER                       58

     BEHIND RIGGS AND MURTAUGH, CRIME SCENE COPS SCURRY BACK
     AND FORTH.  FLASHING LIGHTS.  CAMERAS.  MURTAUGH MAKES
     HIS WAY TO THE CAR.  RIGGS BESIDE HIM.  AS THEY REACH
     THE CAR, MURTAUGH  STOPS:

                         MURTAUGH
               LOOK, I' M SORRY I SAID THAT SHIT
               BACK THERE.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU SAVED MY LIFE.  THANK YOU.

                         RIGGS
               I BET THAT HURT TO SAY.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

59   INT. MURTAUGH HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT                      59

     THE TWO DETECTIVES COME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR, SHEDDING
     THEIR JACKETS.  YOUNG CARRIE APPEARS, NURSING A POPSICLE.

                         CARRIE
               HI, DADDY.  IS THAT A CROOK?

                         MURTAUGH
               NO, HONEY, THIS IS MARTIN, MY
               PARTNER.
                    (SCOOPS HER UP;
                     HUGS HER)
               TELL MARTIN WHAT YOU THINK OF
               CROOKS.

                         CARRIE
               BUTTHEADS.
                    (GIGGLES)
               THEY'RE BUTTHEADS.

                         RIGGS
               KID'S NO DUMMY.

                         CARRIE
               DADDY, MOMMY SAYS YOU HATE HER
               COOKING.

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL MOMMY HATE IS A MILD WORD.

60   INT. KITCHEN                                               60

     TRISH IS COOKING AS THE TWO COPS ENTER.

                         MURTAUGH
               HI, HONEY.
                    (HE  LOOKS  IN
                     THE OVEN)
               WE'RE HAVING SOMETHING BROWN... A
               LARGISH BROWN OBJECT  ...

                         TRISH
               IT'S ROAST.

                         MURTAUGH
               DAMMIT, I WANTED TO GUESS.  HONENY,
               THIS IS MARTIN, MY NEW PARTNER.
               HE'LL BE JOINING US TONIGHT, OKAY?

                         TRISH
               SURE.  ROAST OKAY WITH YOU, MARTIN?

                         RIGGS
               FINE.

                         MURTAUGH
               HOW ABOUT BROWN, ROAST-LIKE
               SUBSTANCE?

                         TRISH
               ROGER, YOU'RE BEING AN ASSHOLE.
                    (KISSES  HIS  EAR)
               DON'T FORGET TO COMPLIMENT RIANNE
               ON HER SHOES.

                         MURTAUGH
               GOT  IT.  DRINK,  MARTIN?

                         RIGGS
               BOURBON, IF YOU HAVE IT.

     MURTAUGH EXITS.  RIGGS STANDS AWKWARDLY AS TRISH  REMOVES
     THE ROAST  FROM  THE  OVEN.

                         RIGGS
               MY WIFE COULD BURN WATER.

                         TRISH
               YOU'RE MARRIED?

                         RIGGS
               I WAS.  SHE'S  DEAD  NOW.

                         TRISH
               OH.  I'M SORRY.

                         RIGGS
               NO PROBLEM.

     HE REACHES FOR A STRAY PIECE OF ROAST.  TRISH SLAPS HIS
     HAND.

                         TRISH
               DON'T PICK.-

     RIGGS SMILES.  A GENUINE SMILE, THE FIRST WE'VE SEEN.

60A  INT. LIVING  ROOM  -  SAME                                   60A

     MURTAUGH IS FIXING DRINKS AS RIANNE ENTERS.  WE ALL
     HEAVE A SIGH.  SHE IS STRICTLY TO PERISH FOR.

                         RIANNE
               HELLO,   FATHER.

                         MURTAUGH
               HELLO, DAUGHTER.  NICE SHOES.

                         RIANNE
               OH, DADDY, AREN'T THEY GREAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               ABSOLUTELY.  HOW MUCH THEY COST?

                         RIANNE
               A HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS.  DO
               YOU REALLY LIKE THEM?

                         MURTAUGH
               A HUNDRED AND --
                   (FROWNS)
               -- THEY'RE SHOES.

                         RIANNE
               RIGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU WEAR THEM ON YOUR FEET.

                         RIANNE
               RIGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               AND THAT'S ALL THEY DO ... ?  THERE'S
               NOT, LIKE A TV INSIDE?

                         RIANNE
               NOPE.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (SHAKES HIS HEAD)
               I'M VERY OLD.

                                                  CUT TO:

61   INT. MURTAUGH'S DEN                                        61

     YOUNG NICK MURTAUGH IS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE TELE-
     VISION, WATCHING A "CHARLEY BROWN CHRISTMAS" AND COLOR-
     ING A PICTURE WITH A BIG BOX OF CRAYONS.  HE STOPS.
     FROWNS.  LOOKS UP -- AT MARTIN RIGGS, WHO IS PEEKING
     HIS HEAD AROUND THE CORNER, WATCHING WITH RAPT FASCINA-
     TION.  RIGGS CHUCKLES, POINTS TO THE SCREEN:

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS GOOD.  I LIKE THIS.

     NICK LOOKS AT HIM VERY STRANGELY.  OKAY, SO THE GUY
     LIKES CARTOONS ...

62   INT. DINING ROOM - MEALTIME                                62

     EVERYONE IS GATHERED, EATING.
     INCREDIBLY HOMEY AND DOMESTIC-LOOKING.
     FOR RIGGS, WHO EATS RAVENOUSLY, IT IS THE FIRST TASTE
     OF WARMTH IN MANY A LONG YEAR.

62A  ACROSS THE TABLE                                          62A

     WE NOTICE SOMETHING KIND OF NEAT:
     RIANNE SIMPLY CANNOT TAKE HER EYES OFF RIGGS.
     SHE STARES AT HIM, IN A TRANCE.  HER BROTHER NICK NUDGES
     HER IN THE RIBS.  SHE PULLS A FACE.

62B  MURTAUGH                                                  62B

     HAS ALSO NOTICED HIS DAUGHTER'S ATTENTIONS, AND YOU CAN
     BET HE'S NOT ALL THAT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

63.  EXT. MURTAUGH'S HOIJSE - DRIVEWAY - BOAT - NIGHT           63

     TIRSH MURTAUGH WHEELING GARBAGE PAIL TO CURBSIDE.

                         TRISH
                    (SARCASTICALLY)
               THAT'S OKAY, HONEY.  I'LL TAKE
               OUT THE GARBAGE.

     BOAT.  MURTAUGH'S HEAD APPEARS SHEEPISHLY FROM WITHIN.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  THANKS, HONEY.

     ON BOARD BOAT, MURTAUGH IS WORKING ON THE ENGINE.  RIGGS
     SITTING ON DRIVER'S SEAT.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHADDAYA THINK?

                         RIGGS
               YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BOATS,
               ROGER?

                         MURTAUGH
               KNOW HOW MUCH THEY COST.

                         RIGGS
               I MEAN, CAN YOU SAIL THIS THING?

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S  WRONG  WITH  YOU?  THIS  AIN'T
               A SAIL BOAT.

                         RIGGS
                    (SMILING)
               THAT'S  WHAT  I  THOUGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               NO TRICK  TO  IT.  THAT'S  THE  FRONT.
               THAT'S THE BACK.  WATER ALL AROUND.
               WHY YOU GOTTA MAKE THINGS SO
               COMPLICATED?

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T.  THAT'S JUST HOW THEY ARE.

     MURTAUGH OPENS AN ICE CHEST, TAKES A BEER FOR HIMSELF
     AND TOSSES  ONE  TO  RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, YEAH.  YOU MEAN AMANDA
               HUNSACKER'S    MURDER?

                         RIGGS
               NOW, DID I MENTION THAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU DON'T HAVE TO.  I CAN READ
               YOUR MIND.

     RIGGS MAKES NO REPLY.  HE JUST LOOKS AT MURTAUGH OVER
     THE RIM OF  HIS  BEER  CAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               I DON'T GET YOU, RIGGS.  WHAT'S THE
               PROBLEM? WE  GOT  ONE  DEAD  GIRL  AND
               ONE DEAD  GUY.  DEAD  GUY  KILLED  THE
               DEAD GIRL AND WE KILLED THE DEAD
               GUY 'CAUSE HE WANTED  US  TO  BE  DEAD
               GUYS.  SEEMS PRETTY EASY TO ME.

     RIGGS HAS WANDERED OVER TO THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  HE IN-
     SPECTS THE SWITCHES AND GAUGES.

                         MURTAUGH
               LOOK, HER SUGAR DADDY WAS DEALIN'
               DRUGS.  SHE SAID SOMETHIN'... OR
               DID SOMETHIN'... OR SAW SOMETHIN'
               SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE, AND HE PITCHED
               HER OFF THE BALCONY INTO THE SWEET
               BY-AN'-BY.
                    (BEAT)
               THAT'S WHY HE CAME  AT  US  TODAY
               WITH A SHOTGUN.

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T  KNOW.  SOUNDS  A  LITTLE
               TOO NEAT TO ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               OF COURSE IT'S NEAT.  AND WHAT'S
               WRONG WITH  NEAT?  I  LIKE  NEAT.

     RIGGS FLIPS A SWITCH AND THE MOTOR ROARS TO LIFE.
     MURTAUGH LEAPS UP.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY!  WATCH  WHAT  YOU'RE  DOIN'!

     MURTAUGH FUMBLES WITH THE SWITCHES IN A FUTILE EFFORT  TO
     TURN OFF THE ENGINE.  BUT RIGGS KNOWS EXACTLY WHICH
     SWITCH TO FLIP.

                         RIGGS
               LOOKIN' FOR THIS?

     HE SILENCES THE ENGINE.  MURTAUGH GLARES AT HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU ASSHOLE.

                         RIANNE
               HI, DAD...

     MURTAUGH JUMPS, STARTLED BY HIS DAUGHTER'S ARRIVAL.
     RIANNE AND RIGGS EXCHANGE A GLANCE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT IS  IT,  RIANNE?

                         RIANNE
               MARK WANTS TO TAKE ME  OUT  TO  A
               CLUB TOMORROW NIGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE GROUNDED -- YOU KNOW THAT.

                         RIANNE
               PLEASE, DADDY ...

                         MURTAUGH
               WHICH ONE IS MARK, ANYWAY?

                         RIANNE
               THE BLOND ONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, YEAH. THE  ONE  WITH  PITS  IN
               HIS  FACE.

                         RIANNE
               THOSE ARE DIMPLES.

                         MURTAUGH
               THOSE ARE PITS.  WHEN HE SMILES,
               I CAN SEE THROUGH HIS HEAD.
                    (BEAT)
               THE ANSWER IS NO.  END OF STORY.

                         RIGGS
               C'MON, ROG.  HAVE A HEART.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT RIGGS -- NOT APPRECIATIVE OF HIS
     INTERVENTION.

                         MURTAUGH
               THE GIRL WAS SMOKING  POT  IN  THE
               HOUSE.  SHE'S GROUNDED!

                        RIANNE
               NEXT TIME I'LL JUST  TAKE  A  BEER
               INSTEAD.  WHY CAN I HAVE  A  BEER
               AND NOT  A JOINT?  IT'S NOT COKE,
               YOU  KNOW, DAD.

     MURTAUGH  LOOKS  DOWN SHEEPISHLY AT THE CAN OF BEER IN HIS
     HAND.  RIGGS  GRINS  TO  HIMSELF.

                         MURTAUGH
               'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, BEER'S LEGAL AND
               GRASS AIN'T.  RIGHT OR WRONG.

                         RIANNE
               WRONG.

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.

     SHE STALKS OFF.  AFTER A MOMENT, MURTAUGH LOOKS OVER TO
     RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'VE LOST TRACK... DID WE RESOLVE
               ANYTHING  HERE  TONIGHT?

     RIGGS SHAKES HIS HEAD, SMILES AND STARTS TO CLIMB OFF
     THE BOAT.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.  WE RESOLVED THAT YOUR WIFE
               TAKES OUT  THE  GARBAGE.  YOUR
               DAUGHTER SMOKES POT, WHICH IS
               ILLEGAL BUT SHOULDN'T BE -- THAT
               YOU DON'T KNOW FROM BOATS, AND
               YOU GOT ONE HELL OF A FAMILY, GUY.

     WALKING TOWARDS TRUCK TOGETHER.

                         MURTAUGH
               THANKS.

                         RIGGS
               ENJOYED THE MEAL.

                         MURTAUGH
               BULLSHIT, BUT  THANKS  ANYWAY.

     A PAUSE.   RIGGS STANDS THERE.  THEN:

                         RIGGS
               YOU DON'T TRUST ME AT ALL, DO YOU?

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL YOU WHAT.  MAKE IT THROUGH
               TOMORROW WITHOUT KILLING ANYBODY.
               ESPECIALLY  ME.  OR  YOURSELF.
               THEN I'LL START TRUSTING YOU.

                         RIGGS
               FAIR ENOUGH.

     HE WALKS TOWARD HIS TRUCK.  STOPS.

                         RIGGS
               I DO IT REAL GOOD,  YOU  KNOW.

                         MURTAUGH
               DO WHAT?

                         RIGGS
               KILL PEOPLE ... ONLY THING I EVER
               DID GOOD.  WHEN I WAS NINETEEN, I
               DID A GUY IN LAOS FROM A THOUSAND
               YARDS OUT.
               RIFLE SHOT IN HIGH WIND.
                    (BEAT)
               TEN GUYS IN THE WORLD COULDA MADE
               THAT SHOT.  HUH.  ONLY THING I WAS
               EVER GOOD AT.
                    (PAUSE;  THEN)
               WELL, SEE YOU TOMORROW.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  SEE  YOU  THEN.

     RIGGS DRIVES  AWAY.  MURTAUGH  WATCHES  HIM.  TURNS.  ON  THE
     WAY BACK INSIDE, HE FLICKS ON THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

65   EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT                                      65

     MARTIN RIGGS CRUISES ALONG IN HIS BATTERED PICKUP TRUCK
     PAST ALL-NIGHT DIVES AND PORNO HOUSES.  THE STREETS ARE
     NEARLY DESERTED.  EXCEPT FOR A YOUNG HOOKER ON THE COR-
     NER.  REAL YOUNG, MAYBE SEVENTEEN.  RIGGS SEES HER AND
     PULLS OVER TO THE CURB.  THE HOOKER APPROACHES.

                         HOOKER
               HI, HANDSOME.  LOOKING FOR
               SOMETHING?

                         RIGGS
               AREN'T  WE  ALL?

                         HOOKER
                    (NODS)
               ARE YOU AFFILIATED WITH ANY LAW
               ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION?

                         RIGGS
                    (PAUSE;  THEN)
               NO. GET  IN  THE  CAR.

     SHE DOES.  CLOSES THE DOOR.

                         RIGGS
               HOW OLD ARE YOU?

                         HOOKER
               TWENTY-TWO.

                         RIGGS
               BULLSHIT.

                         HOOKER
               WHY, YOU LIKE 'EM YOUNG?

                         RIGGS
               YOUNGER THE BETTER.  HOW OLD ARE
               YOU?

                         HOOKER
                    (ALMOST SHYLY)
               SIXTEEN.

     RIGGS NODS.  TAKES OUT A HUNDRED-DOLLAR BILL AND SETS IT
     IN HER  LAP.

                         HOOKER
               WOW.
                    (BEAT)
               SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

                         RIGGS
               I WANT YOU TO COME HOME AND
               WATCH TELEVISION WITH ME.

     HE DRIVES AWAY FROM THE CURB.

66   INT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT                                 66

     THE HOUSE IS DARK AND QUIET AT THIS HOUR.  ROGER MURTAUGH
     FIXES A SANDWICH IN THE KITCHEN.  RICKLES THE CAT PURRS,
     RUBS AGAINST HIS LEG.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY.

     HE KICKS IT ASIDE.  NOTICES A PACKAGE ON THE COUNTER,
     TOGETHER WITH A SCRIBBLED CRAYON NOTE:

     THE GIFT IS A 99C SPECIAL, RIGHT OFF THE RACK AT PIC N'

     HE OPENS THE PACKAGE. TWO  THINGS:  A  HIGH  SCHOOL  YEAR-
     BOOK; ALSO A VIDEOCASSETTE. TAKES IT,  SLIDES  IT  INTO  A
     VCR MACHINE.  TURNS ON THE TELEVISION.

67A  INT./EXT. RIGGS' TRAILER - NIGHT                             67A

     THE HOOKER WATCHES TV -- REALLY ENJOYING THE THREE
     STOOGES. RIGGS STANDS APART  FROM  HER.  HE'S  NOT  WATCH-
     ING TV; HE'S WATCHING HER WATCHING TV.

     HE WEARS A MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION. THE  WORLD  IS  FULL  OF
     HAPPY FAMILIES LIKE MURTAUGH'S, BUT HE HAS TO GET BY
     LIKE THIS.

     HIS EYES SHIFT TO A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE.  HE PICKS IT UP
     AND VIEWS IT SADLY.

                         HOOKER
                    (TURNING TO HIM)
               YOU'RE NOT HAVING A VERY GOOD
               TIME,  ARE  YOU?

     RIGGS PUTS DOWN THE PHOTO.

                         RIGGS
                    (SWEETLY)
               YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.  MAYBE THIS
               IS HOW I LOOK WHEN I'M HAVING A
               GOOD TIME.  MAYBE I'M HAVING THE
               BEST TIME OF MY LIFE.

                         HOOKER
                    (AFTER A BEAT)
               ARE YOU?

     RIGGS DOESN'T ANSWER.

                         HOOKER
               I KNOW... SING ME SOMETHING.

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T SING.

                         HOOKER
               COME ON.  SING ME A SONG.

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T KNOW ANY SONGS.

                         HOOKER
               NOT EVEN A CHRISTMAS SONG?
               EVERYBODY KNOWS A CHRISTMAS SONG.

     RIGGS SHRUGS AND MAKES A HALF-HEARTED ATTEMPT:

                         RIGGS
               SOMETHING THROUGH THE SNOW,
               IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH ...

                         HOOKER
               GOOD.  THAT'S   GOOD.
                    (HELPS HIM OUT)
               OVER THE HILLS WE GO,
               LAUGHING ALL THE WAY.

                         RIGGS
               SOMETHING SOMETHING RING,
               MAKING SOMETHING BRIGHT ...

                         HOOKER
               OH, WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE ...

                         RIGGS
               TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE TONIGHT!

     THEY KNOW THEY GOT IT WRONG,  BUT  THEY'RE  PLEASED  WITH
     THEMSELVES JUST THE SAME.  THE HOOKER HUGS RIGGS IMPUL-
     SIVELY.  RIGGS LOOKS UNCOMFORTABLE.  HE'D LIKE TO SHOW
     HER SOME PLATONIC AFFECTION, BUT HE KNOWS THAT'S
     IMPOSSIBLE.

     HE GENTLY UNWRAPS HER ARMS FROM AROUND HIS NECK.

                         RIGGS
               I BETTER TAKE YOU BACK NOW.

68   SAME PLACE - LITTLE  BIT  LATER                                 68

     MURTAUGH IS IN FRONT OF THE TV. ON  HIS  LAP  IS  A  HIGH
     SCHOOL YEARBOOK.  OPEN TO THE MIDDLE.  HE GLANCES DOWN,
     SEES -- A PHOTOGRAPH OF AMANDA LLOYD.  SENIOR PICTURE.
     SMILING.  YOUNG.  THE GIRL MOST LIKELY TO.  HE LOOKS UP
     UP AT THE TELEVISION.  ON THE SCREEN AMANDA LLOYD IS
     WRITHING  IN  ECSTASY.  SMILING.  MURTAUGH  CONTINUES  TO
     WATCH.  LIGHTS ANOTHER CIGARETTE.  THERE IS A SAD,
     FARAWAY LOOK ON HIS FACE.

69   INT. HALLWAY                                                    69

     VERY LATE NOW. MURTAUGH WALKS DOWN  THE  HALL  TO  A  BEDROOM
     DOOR.  OPENS IT A FRACTION.  INSIDE -- HIS DAUGHTER
     RIANNE IS ASLEEP.

     A SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT FALLS ACROSS THE BED.  SHE IS MORE
     BEAUTIFUL THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN HER.

     MURTAUGH CROSSES TO THE BED, LEANS DOWN, AND KISSES  HER
     FOREHEAD.  SHE STIRS IN HER SLEEP, SMILES LIKE A CAT,
     AND WHISPERS:

                         RIANNIE
               ... MARK ...

     MURTAUGH RECOILS. STANDS UP. WE REALIZE  THAT  UP  UNTIL
     THIS MOMENT, SEE, HE THOUGHT SHE WAS MAYBE A VIRGIN ...

70   INT. MURTAUGH'S BEDROOM                                    70

     HE TAKES OFF HIS ROBE, DRAPES IT ON A CHAIR.  GETS  INTO
     BED SILENTLY NEXT TO HIS SLEEPING WIFE.  LIES AWAKE,
     STARING UP AT THE CEILING.  THE RAIN BEATS ON THE WINDOW,
     THROWING ODD SHADOWS ACROSS HIS FACE. HE  DRIFTS  TOWARD
     SLEEP.  AS HE DOES, WE EVER SO SLOWLY ...

                                            CROSS FADE TO:

71   INT. MURTAUGH BEDROOM                                      71

     SUNLIGHT STREAMS THROUGH THE WINDOWS, MURTAUGH STIRS
     GROGGILY, FORCES OPEN HIS EYES.  STARING HIM IN THE FACE
     IS MARTIN RIGGS' SCRUFFY, EARLY MORNING  FACE.  MURTAUGH
     FROWNS.

                         MURTAUGH
               ... MARTIN...  ?

                         RIGGS
               GOOD MORNING, ROGER.  I'VE BEEN
               DOING A LITTLE THINKING.

     MURTAUGH JUST STARES AT HIM.

                         RIGGS
               ABOUT THE NIGHT AMANDA HUNSAK.ER
               DIED.

     MURTAUGH GRIMACES.

                         MURTAUGH
               DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS ... ?

                         RIGGS
               DAY TIME?

     IN THE KITCHEN TRISH IS SINGING SOMETHING BLUESY, FIXING
     COFFEE.  AT THE TABLE NICK IS DRINKING MILK.  MURTAUGH
     SITS.  RIGGS TAKES OFF HIS SHOULDER HOLSTER, AND WITH
     METICULOUS CARE DRAPES IT DELICATELY OVER THE BACK OF
     HIS CHAIR.  SITS OPPOSITE MURTAUGH.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE SERIOUSLY USING KETCHUP?

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH

               RIGHT, OR MURDER, AND MY QUESTION
               IS... WHAT IS SHE DOING THERE?  I
               CALLED WILSHIRE VICE, THAT'S NOT
               HER USUAL TURF.

                         MURTAUGH
               WOW.
                    (BEAT)
               WOW.  THAT'S REALLY REACHING.

                         RIGGS
               CUT ME A BREAK, IT'S A HUNCH, ROGER.
               I'M HAVING  A  HUNCH.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU COULDN'T HAVE IT AT HOME, YOU
               HAD TO COME HERE AT 7:30 A.M. AND
               HAVE IT.

                         RIGGS
               7:35, AND YES, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
               EXCITED.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M THRILLED.
                    (PAUSE)
               OKAY.

               OKAY, WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY, GO FOR IT.  I'M LISTENING.

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH STAND ON LINE AT THE RANGE.  AROUND
     THEM THE ECHOING BOOM OF GUNSHOTS FILLS THE MORNING AIR.
     THEY STRUGGLE TO BE HEARD OVER THE TUMULT:

                         MURTAUGH
               WE KNOW SOMEONE WAS IN BED WITH
               AMANDA LLOYD THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.   'TIL NOW WE ASSUMED IT WAS
               A MAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY.  LET'S SAY IT WAS DIXIE.

                         RIGGS
               OKAY.  DISGUSTING,   BUT   OKAY:   LET'S
               SAY  DIXIE  SLIPPED  THE  DRAIN  CLEANER
               INTO THE PILLS.

                         MURTAUGH
               SAY SOMEONE PAID HER TO DO IT.

                         RIGGS
               SURE.  SHE  THINKS,   TERRIFIC,   AMANDA
               SWALLOWS  A  COUPLE  DOWNERS  AND  BOOM,
               SHE'S DEAD.  THEN DIXIE --

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT, RIGHT, THEN DIXIE HAS
               PLENTY OF TIME TO SPRITZ THE PLACE
               UP, GET OUT, WHATEVER.

                         MURTAUGH

               EITHER WAY, SHE'S GOTTA MAKE A
               FAST GETAWAY, 'CAUSE NOW THE
               BODY'S PUBLIC.  SHE HAULS ASS
               DOWNSTAIRS.

                         RIGGS
               PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT TO SEE WHAT
               HAPPENED.

                         MURTAUGH
               SOMEONE SPOTS HER.  SHE SAYS 'SHIT.'

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.  SHE ACTUALLY STOPS AND
               SAYS, 'SHIT.'

                         MURTAUGH
               OR, 'DAMN.'

               THE POINT BEING --

                         MURTAUGH
               THE POINT BEING, NOW SHE HAS TO
               COVER HER ASS.

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.  SO SHE SAYS, 'OFFICER,

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGHT.

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.

                    (SIGHS)
               THAT'S PRETTY FUCKING THIN.

                         RIGGS
               VERY THIN.

                    (SMILES)
               HELL WITH IT.  THIN'S MY MIDDLE

                         MURTAUGH
               WOULD YOU LAY OFF THE COOKING?

                         RIGGS
               TELL HER THAT.

     RIGGS STEPS TO THE LINE.  DRAWS THE BERETTA, FIRES OFF
     A FULL CLIP.  THREE-SHOT RHYTHMS, TWO IN THE CHEST, ONE
     IN THE HEAD, TWO IN THE CHEST, ONE IN THE HEAD.
     REMOVES THE MAGAZINES LOVINGLY SNAPS IN A NEW ONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU SLEEP WITH THAT THING UNDER
               YOUR PILLOW?

                         RIGGS
               I WOULD IF I SLEPT.

                         MURTAUGH
               HERE, STAND BACK.

     MURTAUGH STEPS TO THE RED LINE.  STRETCHES.  CRACKS HIS
     NECK.  SHIFTS FROM FOOT TO FOOT.  FINALLY STEADIES HIM-
     SELF.  A MOMENT THEN:  HE CROSS-DRAWS WITH LIGHTNING
     SWIFTNESS.  -- BANG -- !  THE REPORT IS DEAFENING.  THE
     TARGET GROWS A NEAT THIRD EYE.  PERFECT SHOT.  DEAD
     CENTER.  MURTAUGH GRINS, HOLSTERS HIS GUN.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY-HEY.  WOULD'JA LOOK AT THAT?
               PRETTY GOOD FOR AN OLD MAN.

     RIGGS SHRUGS.  DRAWS.  FIRES.  HE ISN'T EVEN LOOKING.

     NONETHELESS. -- HE PUTS A MAGNUM ROUND RIGHT THROUGH
     THE HOLE MADE BY MURTAUGH'S .38.  THE HOLE GETS .60
     INCHES WIDER.  MURTAUGH SCOWLS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH, YEAH.  EAT ME.

     HE STALKS AWAY, PISSED OFF.

75   EXT. WEST L.A. STREET - MORNING                           75

     MURTAUGH'S CAR GLIDES UP TO THE CURB.  IN FRONT OF A
     ROW OF NEAT FRAME HOUSES.  OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.  LATE MODEL
     CARS.  A LITTLE BLACK KID PLAYING ON THE SIDEWALK.

     THE TWO COPS GET OUT, STRIDE TOWARD A  COTTAGE  SET  BACK
     FROM THE STREET.  THEY PASS THE LITTLE KID WHO IS PLAYING
     WITH A PLASTIC BUCKET AND A HEADLESS  STAR  WARS  FIGURE.

                         RIGGS
               HEY, KID.  WHAT'CHA DOING?

     THE KID GRINS, OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF.

                         LITTLE KID
               I PUT THIS ON TOP AND IT FALL
               DOWN.

     HE DEMONSTRATES.  HE PUTS IT  ON  TOP.  IT  FALLS  DOWN.  HE
     GRINS HAPPILY.  RIGGS SHAKES HIS HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               GOOD THINKING.

     THEY KEEP WALKING.  TOWARD THE COTTAGE.

                         MURTAUGH
               VERY THIN.

                         RIGGS
               PROBABLY NOTHING.

     THEY MOUNT THE STEPS TO THE WALK.  AS THEY DO -- THE
     HOUSE SUDDENLY EXPLODES.  IT  BLOWS  APART  CONCUSSIVELY.
     THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT, A LOUD, FLAT BANG --!  AND THE
     THING TEARS TO PIECES.  GLASS  BLOWS  OUT.  WOOD  SPRAYS.
     FLYING SHRAPNEL.  A WALL OF  FLAME.  RIGGS  HITS  THE  DIRT,
     SMOTHERING THE LITTLE BLACK KID.  MURTAUGH DIVES FOR COVER
     BEHIND A TELEPHONE POLE. A PIECE  OF  SHRAPNEL  IMBEDS  IT-
     SELF; RIGHT NEXT TO HIS HEAD.  CARNAGE.  NOISE.  THE
     TUMULT SLOWLY BEGINS TO  FADE.  ECHOES.  FLAMES  RAGE  TO
     THE SKY.  SMOKE ROLLS.  BEAMS COLLAPSE.  THE COTTAGE IS
     NO MORE.  MURTAUGH CLIMBS TO HIS FEET, DAZED; STARES AT
     THE RUBBLE.  LOOKS OVER TOWARD RIGGS, WHO IS GETTING
     UP OFF THE KID.  THE KID IS SHAKEN, BUT UNHURT.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY.

     RIGGS TURNS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE ON FIRE.

     RIGGS LOOKS. THE BACK OF HIS  COAT  IS  COMPLETELY  ABLAZE.

                         RIGGS
               SHIT.

     HE TAKES IT OFF, FLINGS IT ASIDE.

     GOES UP TO MURTAUGH-  LIGHTS A CIGARETTE.

                         RIGGS
               PROBABLY NOTHING.

                         MURTAUGH
               THIN.  VERY THIN.

76   EXT. BURNED-OUT COTTAGE - LATER                            76

     COPS PROWL THROUGH THE GUTTED REMAINS.  CHARRED AND
     BLACK. NOTHING LEFT.  A BODY GOES BY ON A STRETCHER.
     MURTAUGH STOPS IT.

                         MURTAUGH
               HO.
                    (HE  LOOKS  UNDER
                     THE SHEET)
               JESUS.

                         ATTENDANT
               WE'RE HOPING TO FIND SOME TEETH.
               IN THERE.  OTHERWISE, COULD BE
               ANYBODY.  BLACK, WHITE ... COULD
               BE A FUCKIN' BOWL OF SOUP, FOR
               ALL WE --

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY, OKAY.

     THE STRETCHER CONTINUES TOWARD THE WAITING TRUCK.
     MURTAUGH LOOKS OFF,  WHISPERS:

                         MURTAUGH
               BYE-BYE, DIXIE.

77   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              77

     MARTIN RIGGS IS EXAMINING A TWISTED HUNK OF METAL AS
     MURTAUGH WALKS UP BESIDE  HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'CHA GOT?

                         RIGGS
               PART OF THE  DEVICE.
                    (BEAT)
               HOLY COW.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT?

                         RIGGS
               ARTWORK.  THIS IS GODDAMN ARTWORK.

                         MURTAUGH
               SWELL.  I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT.

                         RIGGS
               YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.  THIS IS REAL
               PRO STUFF.  HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SINCE ...
               WELL, SINCE THE WAR.

                         MURTAUGH
               COME AGAIN?

                         RIGGS
               C.I.A. USED TO HIRE MERCS WHO USED
               THIS SAME SETUP.  MERCURY SWITCHES.

     MURTAUGH FROWNS.  A PATROL COP TAPS HIM ON THE SHOULDER.

                         PATROL COP
               SIR, I THINK YOU'D BETTER COME
               WITH ME.

     RIGGS-AND MURTAUGH EXCHANGE GLANCES.  THEY MOVE OFF,
     ACROSS THE STREET.

78   EXT. STREET - BACK OF FIRE  TRUCK                       78

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH STAND BY THE REAR OF THE TRUCK.  A
     CONSTRUCTION CREW WATCHES FROM BEHIND, HEAVY EQUIPMENT
     IDLING SOFTLY.  NEXT TO THEM SITS THE LITTLE BLACKKID
     FROM EARLIER, COLORING WITH CRAYONS.  HIS MOTHER
     HOVERS ...

                         COP
               OKAY, HERE IT IS.  THE LITTLE  KID
               SAYS HE SAW SOMEONE WORKING ON
               THE METER THIS MORNING.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHERE?

                         COP
               ACROSS THE STREET AT  DIXIE'S.  HE
               WAS PLAYIN' SOME KIND OF GAME,
               HIDIN' UNDER THE STAIRS.  SAYS  HE
               SAW THE GUY PRETTY GOOD.

                         MURTAUGH
               JESUS.  THIS COULD BE A BREAK.

                         RIGGS
               YOU KIDDING? THE KID'S  SIX  YEARS
               OLD.

                         COP
               IF THAT.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU CALL THE GAS COMPANY?

                         COP
               SURE DID.  NO ONE SUPPOSED TO
               CHECK THAT METER FOR AT LEAST
               ANOTHER   MONTH.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (NODS)
               LET ME HANDLE THIS.

                         COP
               BE MY GUEST.

                         RIGGS
               WANNA WEAR THE CHICKEN SUIT?  I GOT
               SOME CLOWN MAKEUP.

                         MURTAUGH
               STOW IT.

     HE CROSSES TO THE BOY.

                         MURTAUGH
               HI.  I'M DETECTIVE MURTAUGH.  WHAT'S

                         ALFRED (LITTLE KID)
               ALFRED.

     HE STARES AT MURTAUGH WITH EYES LIKE SAUCERS.

                         MURTAUGH
               HOW OLD ARE YOU, ALFRED?

                         ALFRED
               SIX.

                         MURTAUGH
               WOW.  SIX.
                    (BEAT)
               BET YOU LIKE THE GOBOTS, HUH?

                    (POINTS)
               IS THAT A REAL GUN?

                         MURTAUGH
               YES, IT IS.

                         ALFRED
               DO YOU KILL PEOPLE?

                         MURTAUGH
               NO.  IF A GUY IS HURTING SOMEONE,
               I TRY TO SHOOT HIM IN THE  ARM  OR
               SOMETHING.  JUST TO STOP HIM.

                         ALFRED
               MOMMA SAYS POLICEMAN  SHOOT  BLACK
               PEOPLE.

     MURTAUGH GRIMACES.  ALFRED'S MOTHER LOOKS AWAY QUICKLY.

                         MURTAUGH
               ALFRED, THIS MAN YOU SAW.  THE METER
               MAN ... ?
                    (BEAT)
               YOU GET A GOOD LOOK AT HIM?

                         ALFRED
               I SAW HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               GREAT.  LISTEN, YOU EVER WATCH
               'STARSKY AND  HUTCH'?  'CAUSE  THE

                     A PLASTIC BADGE,
                     PUTS IT ON
                     ALFRED'S CHEST)
               IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN BE  A  JUNIOR
               DETECTIVE.  IF YOU WANT.

     THE KID LOOKS  AT  HIM.  DISTRUST.

                         MURTAUGH
               KEEP IT, IT'S YOURS.  OFFICIAL
               DETECTIVE.

     ALFRED NODS, GRINS.

                         MURTAUGH
               THE MAN AT THE METER.  CAN YOU ...
               PICTURE HIM IN  YOUR  HEAD?  THINK
               ABOUT WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.  GOT
               IT ?

     ALFRED NODS.  MURTAUGH PICKS UP ALFRED'S BOX OF CRAYONS.
     HANDS IT TO THE LITTLE BOY.

                         MURTAUGH
               I WANT YOU TO DRAW HIM FOR ME.

                         ALFRED
               I'M A GOOD DRAWER.

                         MURTAUGH
               TRY TO DRAW THE MAN.

    RIGGS CLEARS HIS THROAT.  ROLLS HIS EYES.

                         RIGGS
               OH, BROTHER.  THIS IS GOOD.  I LIKE
               THIS.

                         MURTAUGH
               CAN IT, MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               WE'RE GONNA PUT OUT AN A.P.B. ON BIG
               BIRD.

                         MURTAUGH
               VERY FUNNY.

                         RIGGS
                    (LAUGHS)
               ATTENTION ALL UNITS.  LARGE YELLOW
               BIRD.   SILLY   VOICE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE HILARIOUS.  ALFRED, DRAW THE
               MAN, OKAY?

     ALFRED NODS, TAKES THE CRAYONS, AND CAREFULLY SELECTS A
     BUNCH OF COLORS.  LAYS THEM OUT LIKE DA VINCI FIXING HIS
     PALETTE.  RIGGS  SHAKES   HIS   HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               BRILLIANT POLICE WORK?  I THINK SO.

                                               TIME CUT:

79   ANOTHER ANGLE                                          79

     MINUTES HAVE PASSED.

                         MURTAUGH
               MARTIN, HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

     RIGGS CROSSES.  ALFRED HAS FINISHED HIS DRAWING, AND
     GUESS WHAT?  IT'S HILARIOUSLY BAD.  LIKE A SIX-YEAR-OLD
     DREW IT OR SOMETHING.  RIGGS RUBS HIS EYES.

                         RIGGS
               OH, MY ...
                    (BEGINS TO
                     LAUGH)
               ... OH, MY...

     HE LAUGHS EVEN HARDER NOW.  MURTAUGH SCOWLS,
     SNATCHES THE PICTURE AWAY.

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC.  VERY PROFESSIONAL.

     RIGGS IS HOOTING.  MURTAUGH SHOWS THE PICTURE TO ALFRED.

                         ALFRED
               HE LAUGH AT MY PICTURE.

                         MURTAUGH
               SHHH.  DON'T MIND HIM.  HE'S
               CRAZY.

                         ALFRED
               I'M A GOOD DRAWER.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU BET.
                    (POINTS)
               ALFRED.  THIS IS ... THE MAN'S ARM,
               RIGHT?

                         ALFRED
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY.  NOW THIS MARK.  IS THIS ...
               WHAT IS THIS?

                         ALFRED
               HE HAD IT ON HIS ARM.

     RIGGS STOPS LAUGHING.  MOVES IN CLOSER.

                         RIGGS
               WHOA.  WHAT WAS ON HIS ARM?

                         MURTAUGH
               WAS IT A BIRTHMARK?
                    (POINTS TO
                      HIS ARM)
               WAS IT LIKE THIS?

                         ALFRED
               NO.  IT  WAS   PAINED.

                         MURTAUGH
               PAINED.

                         RIGGS
               PAINED, PAINED.  WHAT'S HE SAYING?

                         MURTAUGH
               SSSSHH.
                    (BEAT)
               IT WAS ... PAINTED?

                         ALFRED
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               LIKE  A  TATTOO?
                    (BEAT)
               DO YOU  WATCH  POPEYE?  WAS  IT  A
               TATTOO LIKE POPEYE HAS?

     RIGGS ROLLS UP HIS SLEEVE, EXPOSES HIS MARINE TATTOO.
     YOU'VE SEEN THE TYPE:  A TWEETY BIRD WITH A MACHINE GUN,
     OR SOME SUCH.

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS A TATTOO.

     THE BOY'S EYES GO WIDE ONCE AGAIN.  HE POINTS AT RIGGS' ARM.

                         ALFRED
               IT WAS THAT.

     THE  COPS  STOP,  PUZZLED.

                         MURTAUGH
               IT  WAS  THAT?  YOU  MEAN...  JUST
               LIKE  THAT...?

                         ALFRED
               YEAH.  MAN  HAD  THE  SAME  THING.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE SURE?

     ALFRED  NODS.  THE  COPS  EXCHANGE   GLANCES:

                         RIGGS
               SPECIAL FORCES TATTOO ... ?

                         MURTAUGH
               MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT THE HELL ARE WE INTO HERE ... ?

80   EXT. CLIFFSIDE HOUSE - DAY                                    80

     A SPRAWLING, EXPENSIVE VILLA NESTLED ON THE SIDE  OF  A
     BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE  OCEAN.  TERRACES,  VERANDAHS,
     GAZEBOS.  ARCHITECTURE THAT MERITS THREE SYLLABLES.  THE
     OCEAN LOOKS CHEAP BY COMPARISON.  A MEMORIAL SERVICE IS
     IN PROGRESS.  A GROUP OF PEOPLE, MOSTLY YOUNG, FRIENDS
     OF AMANDA LLOYD; ALL ARE DRESSED IN  FUNERAL  BLACK.

81   NEARBY --                                                    81

     MARTIN RIGGS IS COLLAPSED IN A LAWN  CHAIR,  SMOKING AND
     LOOKING THOROUGHLY OUT OF PLACE.  SEEING  THE  GIRL, HE
     FROWNS ... PUFFS ON HIS CIGARETTE, AND ROLLS A  QUARTER
     OVER HIS KNUCKLES LIKE A  STAGE  MAGICIAN.  NIMBLE,  TRAINED
     FINGERS.  A THOROUGHLY UNCONSCIOUS HABIT.

82   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 82

     DICK LLOYD LOOKS WORSE THAN EVER.  HE  STANDS,  STARING
     OUT OVER THE OCEAN -- AS A HAND COMES OUT OF NOWHERE ...
     GRABS HIS SHOULDER, AND SPINS HIM ROUGHLY AROUND:  FACE-
     TO-FACE WITH ROGER MURTAUGH.  EYES BURNING LIKE COLD FIRE.

                         MURTAUGH
               HI, GUY.

                         LLOYD
               ROGER... WHAT ... WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

                         MURTAUGH
               NOT MUCH.
                     (BEAT)
               WANNA TELL ME ABOUT IT?

                         LLOYD
               TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T BULLSHIT ME.  THAT'S OVER.
                    (BEAT)
               YOUR DAUGHTER WASN'T KILLED
               BECAUSE OF SOMETHING SHE WAS INTO.
               SHE WAS KILLED BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
               YOU'RE INTO.  STOP ME IF I'M WRONG.

                         LLOYD
               I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
               ABOUT.  ROGER, I ...

                         MURTAUGH
               KEEP YOUR HANDS IN FRONT.

                         LLOYD
                    (STOPS;
                     STARTLED)
               HEY.  TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               FUCK EASY.
                    (BEAT)
               WHEN YOU CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY,
               YOU WERE GONNA BLOW THE WHISTLE,
               WEREN'T YOU?

                         LLOYD
               BLOW THE WHISTLE ON WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU TELL ME.  YOU WERE GONNA SPILL
               YOUR GUTS.  SO THEY KILLED YOUR
               DAUGHTER.  TELL ME I'M WRONG.

     LLOYD SWALLOWS HARD, FLUSTERED.  HE CAN'T MEET MURTAUGH'S
     EYES.

                         MURTAUGH
               TALK TO ME.

                         LLOYD
               CAN'T ... CAN'T DO THAT ...

                         MURTAUGH
               THEY KILLED YOUR DAUGHTER.

                         LLOYD
               I...

                        MURTAUGH
               THEY PAID OFF A HOOKER TO POISON
               YOUR DAUGHTER.  TALK TO ME!

     LLOYD SHOOTS A DESPERATE GLANCE ACROSS THE LAWN.  AT HIS
     OTHER DAUGHTER, AMANDA'S TWIN.

                         LLOYD
               DAMMIT,  ROGER,   I'VE...   VE  O
               ANOTHER DAUGHTER!

                         MURTAUH
               SHE'LL BE PROTECTED.
                    (BEAT)
               IT'S OVER, PAL.

                         LLOYD
               PROTECTED.  THAT'S A LAUGH... YOU
               DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

                         MURTAUGH
               ACQUAINT ME.

                                             TIME CUT:

83   INT. LLOYD'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                        83

     THE TWO MEN ARE INSIDE NOW.  THE SUNLIGHT FILTERS IN
     THROUGH A LARGE PICTURE WINDOW FROM THE LAWN.

     LLOYD IS PACING BACK AND FORTH.   HE TOUCHES HIS STOMACH
     IN THE CLASSIC GESTURE OF ULCER-CARRIERS EVERYWHERE.
     OPENS THE FRIDGE, REMOVES A CARTON OF MILK.  THERE MUST
     BE THREE CASES OF THE STUFF.  DRINKS, TURNS TO MURTAUGH.
     A MAN AT THE  END  OF  HIS  ROPE:

                         LLOYD
               IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE
               WAR.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M   LISTENING.

                         LLOYD
               I ENDED UP WORKING FOR A GROUP
               CALLED AIR AMERICA.  C.I.A. FRONT,
               SECRETLY RAN THE ENTIRE WAR OUT OF
               LAOS.  I WAS PART OF A SPECIAL
               UNIT CALLED SHADOW COMPANY.  MERCS.
               TRAINED KILLERS.  WHEN CHARLEY WAS
               BRINGING IN HEROIN TO FINANCE THE
               V.C. GOVERNMENT, SHADOW COMPANY
               WENT IN AND BURNED IT ALL DOWN.  WE
               KILLED EVERYBODY.  BUT WE ALSO ...
               FORMED  A  PLAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               KEEP TALKING.

                         LLOYD
               COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, SHADOW COMPANY
               GOT TOGETHER AGAIN.  THE  WAR  WAS
               OVER, BUT WE STILL HAD A  LIST  OF
               SOURCES.  IN ASIA.

                         MURTAUGH
               AND ... ?

                         LLOYD
               AND WE'VE BEEN BRINGING IT IN EVER
               SINCE.

                         MURTAUGH
               BRINGING WHAT IN?

                         LLOYD
               THINK REAL HARD.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEROIN.

                         LLOYD
                    (NODS)
               TWO SHIPMENTS A YEAR.  RUN BY
               EX-C.I.A.  SOLDIERS, MERCS.  NO
               ONE KNOWS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU SON OF  A  BITCH.

     LLOYD DOES NOT REPLY.  A PAUSE, THEN:

                         MURTAUGH
               IF YOU WERE GETTING COLD FEET,
               WHY'D THEY KILL  AMANDA?  WHY  NOT
               JUST  KILL  YOU?

                         LLOYD
               THEY CAN'T.  THEY NEED ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHY?

                         LLOYD
               MY BANK.  IT'S  THE  FRONT.  MAKES
               EVERYTHING LOOK GOOD ON THE TAX
               REPORT.

                         MURTAUGH
               THE TAX REPORT ... ?

                         LLOYD
               THIS IS BIG BUSINESS, ROGER.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (ICE COLD)
               NOT ANY MORE.  I'M GONNA BURN
               IT DOWN.

                         LLOYD
               YOU CAN'T.  IT'S  TOO  BIG.  THESE
               GUYS ARE TRAINED KILLERS.

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL ME ABOUT THE  NEXT  SHIPMENT.

                         LLOYD
               NO.  NO WAY.

     MURTAUGH GRABS A FRAMED PICTURE OF AMANDA, SLAMS IT
     DOWN ON A WOODEN BUL--CHER BLOCK.  THE GLASS SHATTERS.
     LLOYD STARES.

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL ME!!!

     LLOYD FLINCHES.  LEANS BACK, A DREAMY LOOK IN HIS EYES.
     SPEAKS FROM VERY FAR AWAY ...

                         LLOYD
                    (SOFTLY)
               NOTHING ... WRONG WITH THE KIDS,
               ROGER. WE'RE  ALL  FUCKED  UP.  US
               OLD BASTARDS ... WE'RE KILLING THEM.

     AND SUDDENLY THERE IS A GUN IN HIS HAND.  AIMED AT MURTAUGH.

                         LLOYD
               BACK OFF.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, SWELL.  GOOD MOVE.

                         LLOYD
               I'M NOT KIDDING. I'M  IN  TOO  FAR
               NOW.

     MURTAUGH DOES NOT BUDGE.  LLOYD COCKS THE HAMMER.

                         LLOYD
               THE GUN IS SILENCED, ROGER.

     MURTAUGH STARES HIM DOWN.  EYES  LIKE  FIRE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, BUDDY ... ?
               YOU GONNA SAVE MY LIFE, JUST SO
               YOU CAN SNUFF ME TWENTY YEARS
               LATER...?

                         LLOYD
               THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

                         MURTAUGH
               I GUESS.

     A MOMENT. LLOYD STARES INTENTLY.  FINGER  SWEATING  ON  THE
     TRIGGER.

                         MURTAUGH
               IF YOU CAN DO IT, DO IT.  I DON'T
               FUCKING CARE ANYMORE.

     LLOYD BLINKS. SWALLOWS.  ANOTHER  MOMENT.  FINALLY  --  HE
     LOWERS THE GUN.  SIGHS.

                         LLOYD
               ... WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW... ?

     MURTAUGH RELAXES VISIBLY. AND THAT'S  WHEN  TWO  THINGS
     HAPPEN. THE PICTURE WINDOW  GLASS  SUDDENLY  COLLAPSES.
     FALLS TINKLING INTO A MILLION SHARDS. AND  THE  CARTON  OF
     MILK IN LLOYD'S HAND POPS, SPURTING MILK ALL  OVER  THE
     FRONT OF HIS BLACK SUIT.  HE FROWNS.  STARES AT THE
     DRIBBLING MILK. BLINKS. AND HIS EYES  SNAP  OPEN  WIDE,  AS
     BLOOD SEEPS OUT OF HIS SHIRT, SPATTERING THE FLOOR.

                         LLOYD
               ROGER -- !

     WITH HIS DYING BREATH, HE LEAPS IN FRONT  OF  MURTAUGH.
     TAKES THE SECOND BULLET. THE ONE  MEANT  FOR  MURTAUGH.
     IT BLOWS HIM INTO ROGER, TAKES THEM BOTH TO THE  FLOOR  IN
     A BREATH-CRUSHING IMPACT. MORE BULLETS  CHOP  THE  KITCHEN.
     CHINA PLATES BURST INTO A GLASSY SPRAY.  FOOD SPATTERS
     AND GUSHES, STAINING THE WALLS.  MURTAUGH  ROLLS  FREE,
     THEN, A MAN POSSESSED:  SCREAMS OUT THE WINDOW:

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGGS!!!

84   EXT. LAWN                                                       84

     MURTAUGH'S VOICE IS FAR AWAY.  RIGGS LOOKS UP FROM HIS
     LAWN CHAIR. NOTICES  TWO  THINGS:  ONE:  EVERYTHING  SEEMS
     NORMAL. NOBODY HAS HEARD THE  SHOTS.  TWO:  THE  GLASS  IN
     THE KITCHEN WINDOW... SOMETHING STRANGE, WHAT THE HELL
     IS IT ... OH, YEAH, IT'S  BROKEN, SOMEONE BROKE THE GLASS ...
     AND RIGGS IS ON HIS FEET IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

85   BACK INSIDE                                                      85

     MURTAUGH IS AT THE WINDOW.  GUN POINTED.

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGGS!!!

86   MURTAUGH'S POV                                                  86

     REVEALS A CROWD OF PEOPLE, MILLING BACK AND FORTH, HE
     HAS NO IDEA WHERE THE SNIPER IS,  AND  SUDDENLY  BAM  --  !
     THE WOOD BLOWS OUT NOT TWO INCHES  FROM  HIS  HEAD  AND  HE
     DUCKS, AND MEANWHILE -- BACK OUTSIDE ...

87   MARTIN RIGGS                                                     87

     HE'S ON THE MOVE. HE JOGS ... TROTS ... RUNS ...  NOTICING  A
     LONE MAN IN BLACK, STRIDING QUICKLY ACROSS THE LAWN,
     STRIDING INTO THE CROWD ... TOWARD THE EDGE OF  THE  BLUFF  ...
     THINGS HAPPEN FAST NOW, PAY ATTENTION, AS -- THE MAN
     TURNS, SEES RIGGS ... RIGGS SEES HIM... AND THE MAN IS
     NONE OTHER THAN MR. JOSHUA.  CREW CUT.  SUNGLASSES.
     MOVING FAST.

88   MURTAUGH                                                         88

     DIVING OUT THE WINDOW.  HITS.  ROLLS, COMES UP.  SCREAM-
     ING, WAVING AT RIGGS ...

89   RIGGS                                                            89

     GUN OUT ... MOVING FAST,  SHOVING  THROUGH  THE  CROWD,  PEOPLE
     SCREAMING NOW, "JESUS, HE'S GOT A GUN -- !" RUNNING
     ACROSS THE LAWN,  MURTAUGH  THIRTY  YARDS  BEHIND,  MOVING,
     HARD AND FAST,  BOTH  GUNS  DRAWN,  PUSHING/SHOVING,  KNOCK-
     ING PEOPLE ASS OVER TEACUPS AND MEANWHILE LET US NOT
     FORGET --

90   JOSHUA                                                          90

     MOVING AT A DEAD RUN, NOW, GUN OUT ... AT THE EDGE OF THE
     CLIFF. PEOPLE ALL  AROUND  HIM,  CONFUSED,  I  MEAN  JESUS,
     WHAT THE HELL IS ALL  THIS  SHOOTING  ABOUT,  AND  RIGGS  CAN'T
     GET A CLEAR SHOT ... HE'S SWEEPING THE  GUN,  BACK  AND  FORTH,
     BODIES CROSSING IN FRONT OF HIM... ALL THE WRONG BODIES,
     GODDAMMIT...!  MOVING FORWARD, SHOUTING:

                         RIGGS
               LIE DOWN!!!  DOWN!!!

     MURTAUGH, SPRINGING HELL BENT  FOR  LEATHER  --  AND  FOLKS,
     GRAB YOUR HATS ... BECAUSE JUST THEN,  A  BELL  COBPA  HELI-
     COPTER CRESTS THE EDGE OF THE BLUFF.

     AN EXPLOSION OF SOUND...
     AS IT RISES LIKE AN AVENGING ANGEL ...
     HOVERS, SHATTERING THE AIR WITH TURBO-THROB, SANDBLASTING
     THE HILLSIDE WITH A ROTO-WASH OF LOOSE DIRT, TABLES,
     CHAIRS, EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT NAILED DOWN ...

     SCREAMING, CHAOS, FRENZY.
     THREE WORDS THAT APPLY TO THIS SCENE.

     AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS -- JOSHUA STEPS ONTO THE
     CHOPPER AND IS HAULED INSIDE.
     NO EXPRESSION.
     THE TOTAL PROFESSIONAL.
     AND THEN, MY FRIENDS, IT'S BYE-BYE TIME.  THE CHOPPER
     ROARS LIKE A BEHEMOTH, TILTS --
     SLIPS OVER THE SIDE AND PLUMMETS AWAY ...

     SLICK.  VERY SLICK.
     EXCEPT MARTIN RIGGS IT NOT IMPRESSED.

     HE'S STILL RUNNING, YOU SEE ...
     DIVES FLAT AT THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF, NEARLY FLINGS
     HIMSELF OVER THE DAMN EDGE ...
     GUN EXTENDED LIKE IT'S PART OF HIS ARM...
     FINGER FLAT ON THE TRIGGER ...
     BLOWING SHOT AFTER SHOT AT THE RETREATING CHOPPER ...
     BAM-BAM-BAM        HIS FACE CONTORTED IN A RICTUS OF
     ANIMAL CONCENTRATION...

     AND HE WINGS THE CHOPPER, EVEN.  POP
     SPRAY OF FIBERGLASS, BUT NOSSIR, NO CIGAR...
     CAUSE THE DAMN CHOPPER FLIES AWAY.

     AND RIGGS DUMPS HIS MAGAZINE, STUFFS IN A NEW ONE ...
     AND JESUS CHRIST HE KEEPS FIRING.

     AS MURTAUGH WALKS UP BESIDE HIM.  STARES DOWN.
     GUN HELD LOOSE AT HIS SIDE.

     RIGGS STILL FIRES, BAM-BAM-BAM
     DOESN'T KNOW IT YET ...
     UNTIL HIS MAGAZINE CLICKS EMPTY.

     HE LIES FLAT.
     STARES.
     PEOPLE SCREAMING, RUNNING AWAY.
     MURTAUGH STANDING OVER HIM, STARING DOWN AT THIS ANIMAL
     WITH A GUN, WHO EVEN NOW REFUSES TO  LOOK  AWAY  FROM  THE
     RETREATING CHOPPER, WHOSE GUN EVEN NOW CONTINUES TO
     FOLLOW ITS COURSE OUT OVER THE SEA.

     HANDS, CLUTCHING TLIE BARREL.
     FINALLY, THEY RELAX.
     RIGGS SHUTS HIS EYES.
     MURTAUGH STARES.

                         GENERAL
               THAT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING.  THE

     ONE OF THEM IS ROGER MURTAUGH'S DAUGHTER RIANNE.  THE

               MARK, I GOTTA GET HOME.

                         MARK
               WOULD YOU QUIT WORRYING?  YOUR
               MOM THINKS YOU'RE ASLEEP AND
               YOUR DAD'S BUSY SHOOTING CROOKS.

                         RIANNE
               HE SAID HE'LL SHOOT YOU IF WE
               HAVE SEX.

                         MARK
               SOME THINGS ARE WORTH DYING FOR.

     HE LEANS IN AND KISSES HER.  PASSION, HORNINESS.  SOME-
     THING.  HE RUNS A HAND  INSIDE  HER  SWEATER.  SHE  STARTS  TO
     RESIST.  GIVES IN.

                         RIANNE
               WAIT.

     MARTIN RIGGS WALKS SLOWLY DOWN THE BOULEVARD.  IN ONE
     HAND HE CARRIES A SNAPSHOT OF AMANDA LLOYD.  MALE PROS-
     TITUTES TAKE ONE LOOK AT HIM AND FLEE.

     HE STOPS TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE.  AS HE DOES -- HE NOTICES
     A REFLECTION IN THE SILVER LIGHTER.

     TWO PINPOINTS OF LIGHT.  MOVING.  HE THROWS AWAY THE CIG-
     ARETTE. SPINS, DRAWING HIS  GUN.  HEADLIGHTS,  AS  A  CAR
     COMES BARRELING OUT OF THE DARKNESS.  BEARING DOWN ON
     RIGGS AT FIFTY MILES AN  HOUR.  RIGGS  FIRES.  THE  WIND-
     SHIELD SPLINTERS.  NO DICE.  THE CAR KEEPS COMING.  RIGGS
     FIRES AGAIN, SPRINTS FOR COVER -- AS  A  MERCENARY  LEANS
     OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW WITH A PUMP SHOTGUN.  TRIGGERS
     THREE BLASTS AT RIGGS. THE FIRST TWO  BLOW  OUT  CHUNKS  OF
     SCENERY. THE THIRD TAKES RIGGS  IN  THE  CHEST.  BLOWS  HIM
     BACKWARD THROUGH A STORE WINDOW.  GLASS SHATTERS.  HE HITS
     THE GROUND IN A HEAP.  THE CAR SHRIEKS OFF INTO THE NIGHT,
     LAYING RUBBER.  THE ECHO OF GUNFIRE SLOWLY FADES ON THE
     WIND...

     RIGGS LIES CRUMPLED IN A POOL  OF  BROKEN  GLASS.  MURTAUGH
     CHARGES FROM ACROSS THE STREET.  HE THROWS HIMSELF DOWN
     BESIDE THE DEAD RIGGS.  RIPS OPEN RIGGS' SHIRT REVEALING --
     A BULLETPROOF VEST.  RIGGS OPENS HIS EYES.

                         RIGGS
               I'M PISSED, ROGER.  NOW I'M PISSED.

               ROGER.  QUIT LOOKING SO DAMN
               WORRIED.  I'M   FINE.

               GOT YOUR HEAD.

               FUCK THAT.  TWO INCHES TO THE LEFT,
               THEY WOULD'VE GOT MY SMOKES.

     HE TAKES OUT A PACK, LIGHTS ONE UP.

                         RIGGS
               OH, BY THE WAY:  GUY WHO SHOT ME?

                         MURTAUGH

97   EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT

     MURTAUGH'S CAR SCREECHES TO THE CURB.  HOPS THE SIDEWALK,
     JOLTS TO A STOP.  THE TWO COPS ARE OUT AND RUNNING IN A
     DEAD HEAT TOWARD THE FRONT DOOR. MURTAUGH FLINGS OPEN
     THE DOOR. STOPS. ON THE CARPET BENEATH THE MAIL  SLOT
     IS A TINY ENVELOPE WITH SEASONS GREETINGS EMBLAZONED
     ACROSS THE FRONT.  A NOTE IS ATTACHED WITH A PAPER CLIP.
     ONE SIDE READS DETECTIVE ROGER MURTAUGH. ON THE OTHER
     SIDE IS A MESSAGE IN BLOCK CAPITALS.

               YOUR DAUGHTER LOOKS REALLY PRETTY NAKED

     MURTAUGH TEARS OPEN THE ENVELOPE, AFRAID TO BREATHE.
     INSIDE IS A POLAROID SNAPSHOT. THE AUDIENCE MAY GET A
     GLIMPSE OF IT, OR THEY MAY NOT.  EITHER WAY, THE EFFECT
     IT HAS ON MURTAUGH IS DEVASTATING.  HE DROPS THE SNAPSHOT
     LIKE A LIVE SNAKE.  BACKS AWAY, STUMBLES INTO THE WALL.
     SHAKES HIS HEAD.

                         MURTAUGH
               BASTARDS ... BASTARDS ...

     MURTAUGH LOOKS UP. SNAPS OUT  OF   IT.  DOWN  THE  HALL,  HIS
     WIFE TRISH MOVES TO ANSWER THE    PHONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T ANSWER THAT!!

                         MURTAUGH
               MURTAUGH.

     HE LISTENS INTENTLY, A LOOK OF PURE DREAD ON HIS FACE.
     HANGS UP SLOWLY, STARES STRAIGHT  AHEAD.  ON  THE  TABLE,  A
     STUFFED BEAR STARES BACK IMPASSIVELY.  TRISH MURTAUGH

     TOUCHING HER DAUGHTER'S POSSESSIONS.

     MURTAUGH ENTERS.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER.
     HE HANDS HER THE .22.

                         MURTAUGH
               TAKE THIS.  UNTIL IT'S OVER, I
               DON'T WANT YOU TO LET IT OUT OF
               YOUR SIGHT.
     HIS WIFE NODS.  RUNS A HAND THROUGH HER HAIR.  SHIFTS
     FROM ONE FOOT TO THE OTHER.

                         MURTAUGH
               THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HURT HER.
               IF I DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY...
               THEY'LL LET HER GO.
                    (BEAT)
               SHE'S COMING HOME.

     A MOMENT.  THEN:

                         TRISH
               WHAT ABOUT YOU  ...  ?

     MURTAUGH SAYS NOTHING.

102  INT.  LIVING  ROOM  -  SAME  TIME                        102

     RIGGS HAS HIS SHIRT OFF, AND IS CAREFULLY REMOVING
     SLIVERS OF GLASS FROM HIS SHOULDER.  CIGARETTE DANGLING
     FROM HIS LIPS.

     HE HEARS A NOISE
     AND SPINS, STARTLED.

103  RIGGS' POV - SIX-YEAR-OLD CARRIE MURTAUGH             103

     ADORABLE IN A BLUE NIGHTGOWN, RICKLES THE CAT CRADLED
     LOVINGLY IN HER ARMS.

     RIGGS RELAXES.
     SMILES.
     CARRIE WALKS  OVER  TO  HIM.

                         RIGGS
               HEY, MISSY.

                         CARRIE
               I  CAN'T   SLEEP.

                         RIGGS
               UH-OH.  NOT GOOD.

     HE SCOOPS HER UP.

                         RIGGS
               WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

                         CARRIE
               RICKLES THE CAT.

                         RIGGS
               HUH.  HE IS  A  CUTIE.

     CARRIE LOOKS  AT  HIM  THEN.
     AND SHE DOES A PECULIAR THING.
     SLOWLY, SHE REACHES OUT ...
     RIGGS LOOKING ON...
     AND TOUCHES HIS BACK.  RUNS HER TINY HAND OVER THE KNIFE
     SCAR BENEATH HIS SHOULDER.
     FASCINATED BY IT.

                         CARRIE
               OUCH.

     RIGGS LOOKS AT HER.  SMILES, AND WHISPERS SOFTLY:

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.
                    (BEAT)
               OUCH...

     AND HE SUDDENLY HUGS THE LITTLE GIRL FOR ALL HE'S  WORTH.
     CLOSES HIS EYES TIGHT.

     IN THAT MOMENT, EVERY SINGLE YEAR CATCHES UP TO RIGGS,
     AND HE LOOKS, FOR A MOMENT, INCREDIBLY OLD, AND SO VERY,
     VERY TIRED ...

104  INT. LIVING ROOM  -  LATER                             104

     CARRIE IS ASLEEP ON THE COUCH, SNUGGLED BENEATH A KNITTED
     AFGHAN.  RIGGS AND MURTAUGH STAND ACROSS THE ROOM, CON-
     FERRING IN HUSHED TONES.

                         RIGGS
               YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO KILL
               HER.

                         MURTAUGH
               YES.

                         RIGGS
               YOU WANT HER BACK, YOU'VE GOT TO
               TAKE HER  AWAY  FROM  THEM.

                         MURTAUGH
               I KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               GOOD.  WE DO THIS MY WAY.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU SHOOT, YOU SHOOT TO KILL.  GET
               AS MANY AS YOU CAN.  DON'T MISS.

                         MURTAUGH
               I WON'T MISS.

     A PAUSE.  RIGGS STUDIES MURTAUGH.  THEN:

                         RIGGS
               WE'RE GONNA GET BLOODY ON THIS ONE.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST ME.

     MURTAUGH STARES AT HIM FOR A MOMENT.  THEN, HE FINALLY
     SPEAKS ...

                         MURTAUGH
               ... HOW... GOOD ARE YOU... ?

                         RIGGS
               WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               ARE YOU... ONLY CRAZY ... OR ARE
               YOU... AS GOOD AS YOU SAY YOU
               ARE... ?

     THERE  IS  A  PAUSE.   THEN:

                         RIGGS
               NO ONE CAN TOUCH ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               GOOD.  KILL EVERY FUCKING ONE OF
               THEM.  OKAY ... ?

     AT WHICH POINT, MY FRIENDS, A LIGHT FLICKERS ON BEHIND
     RIGGS' EYES.

     WE SEE  GRIM  DETERMINATION,  SURE  ...
     BUT WE ALSO SENSE SOMETHING ELSE, ODDLY ENOUGH:
     ANTICIPATION.
     RIGGS IS A MACHINE ... AND THE MACHINE IS, WELL ...
     REVVING  UP.  HE  LOOKS  AT   MURTAUGH:

                         RIGGS
               GET HALF.  I'LL KILL THE OTHER
               HALF.

     A MOMENT PASSES BETWEEN THEM. THIS  WILL  BE  THE  MOST
     DEVASTATING NIGHT OF THEIR LIVES.  THEY WILL PROBABLY
     DIE.

     A RINGING PHONE SHATTERS THE STILLNESS.

                         RIGGS
               HERE WE GO.

105  OMITTED                                                       105

106  INT. MARTIN RIGGS' TRAILER - DAY                              106

     THE APARTMENT IS DARK, ILLUMINATED ONLY  BY  A  TINY  LAMP.
     RIGGS CROSSES TO THE WINDOW, PEERS OUT THROUGH SLATTED
     BLINDS.  ON TELEVISION A GROUP OF CAROLERS SINGS "TIDINGS
     OF COMFORT AND JOY." RIGGS  LOOKS  AT  THE  WALL  CALENDAR:
     DECEMBER 22.  THE CLOCK TICKS.  THE REFRIGERATOR HUMS.

     HE GOES TO THE CLOSET.  OPENS IT.  A CLOUD OF DUST
     BILLOWS OUT. REACHES  IN,  REMOVES  A  WEATHERED  CARDBOARD
     BOX.  SITS IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM, TAKES A SHOT OF
     BOURBON.

     OPENS THE BOX. INSIDE IS  A  SET  OF  DESERT  FATIGUES.  HE
     TAKES THEM OUT.  UNDERNEATH  A  WICKED-LOOKING  HUNTING
     KNIFE. HE TAKES THAT, TOO.  HOLDS  IT  UP  NEAR  HIS  FACE,
     AND IT POSITIVELY SPARKLES IN THE DIM LIGHT ...

                                                 TIME  CUT:

107  ANOTHER ANGLE                                          107

     RIGGS STANDS, FULLY DRESSED.  COLT .22 IN AN ANKLE
     HOLSTER.  COMBAT WEBBING.  DESERT BOOTS.

     BERETTA .9 MILLIMETER, RIDING THE RIGHT-HAND THIGH.
     SCANS HIS APPEARANCE IN THE MIRROR.
     BREATHES:  IN, OUT ... IN, OUT...

     GLANCES AT THE PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS WIFE ON THE WALL.
     WEDDING GOWN.  WHITE LACE-AND-SATIN RUFFLES.  BEAUTIFUL.

     HIS FACE IS  CRAGGY.  WEATHERED.  COVERED  WITH  DESERT
     PAINT.  SURELY HE WAS NEVER MARRIED ... NOT THIS DEMON...

                         RIGGS
               FORGIVE ME.

     THERE IS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  RIGGS SPINS.  LIGHTNING
     QUICK.  GUN IN HAND.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
               ME.  MURTAUGH.

                         RIGGS
               COME IN SLOW.

     THE DOOR OPENS  AND ROGER MURTAUGH ENTERS, CARRYING A
     BRIEFCASE.  HE  LOOKS BRIEFLY AT RIGGS' COMBAT GET-UP.
     SHRUGS.  SETS THE BRIEFCASE ON THE BED, OPENS IT.  IT
     IS FILLED WITH ROUND UPON ROUND OF AMMUNITION.

                         MURTAUGH
               HOLLOW POINTS.  ARMOR PIERCING.

                         RIGGS
                    (NODS)
               YOU WEREN'T FOLLOWED?

                         MURTAUGH
               NO.

     RIGGS BEGINS SCOOPING UP HANDFULS OF AMMO.

108  INT. RIGGS' TRAILER - FEW MINUTES LATER                      108

     MURTAUGH IS HOOKING A WIRE IN PLACE UNDER HIS COLLAR.

                         MURTAUGH
               TESTING, ONE, TWO, THREE...

                         RIGGS
               FINE.

     HE STRAPS ON HIS HUNTING KNIFE.

                         RIGGS
               IT'S TWELVE-THIRTY.  LET'S MOVE.

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T GET TOO CLOSE.  THEY'LL
               SPOT YOU.

     RIGGS HOISTS A LONG-RANGE SNIPER RIFLE.  INFRA-RED SCOPE.

                         RIGGS
               THOUSAND YARDS OKAY ... ?

109  EXT. LOW DESERT - DAY                                  109

     THE DESERT FLOOR SHIMMERS WITH STORED HEAT, BATHED IN
     RELENTLESS SUNLIGHT.

     A LONE CAR, PLOWING ALONG TOWARD THE HORIZON.  LOOKING
     LOST AND UTTERLY ALONE BENEATH THE CLEAR DECEMBER SKY.

110  INT. CAR - ROGER MURTAUGH                                    110

     DRIVING. RELENTLESSLY ONWARD, HIS FACE  LOCKED  IN  A  MASK
     OF CONTAINED FURY.  DUST BILLOWS PAST THE WINDOWS.  WIND.
     HE KEEPS DRIVING, STRAINING HIS EYES AHEAD, FOCUSING
     THROUGH THE HUNDRED-DEGREE SHIMMER... NOTICING, FINALLY
     A SERIES OF SHAPES ... DIM MIRAGES... SILHOUETTES MAYBE,
     POSSIBLY MEN... POSSIBLY THE MEN...        THE  MIRAGE  RESOLVES.

     MERCS.  STANDING NEXT TO A BLACK SEDAN.  MURTAUGH
     STIFFENS. LEANS FORWARD,  PUNCHES  THE  CIGARETTE  LIGHTER,
     AND AS HE DOES -- HE WHISPERS INTO HIS HIDDEN
     MICROPHONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               SPLIT.

111  EXT. CAR - DAY

     IT HAPPENS IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE:  THE  TRUNK  POPS  OPEN,
     AND OUT ROLLS MARTIN RIGGS.  YANKS A ROPE.  THE TRUNK
     SLAMS SHUT.  RIGGS HITS.  ROLLS.  COMES UP, COMBAT-
     CROUCHED, HUNKERS OFF AT A DEAD HEAT.  HE IS CLAD 3'.N
     HIS DESERT FATIGUES.  MAGNUM SNIPER RIFLE SLUNG OVER
     ONE SHOULDER.

112  EXT. MURTAUGH - DESERT                                       112

     MURTAUGH ROLLS TO A HALT AND STEPS FROM HIS CAR.

     FACING THREE ARMED MERCS.  MURTAUGH  SIMPLY  STANDS  THERE,
     READING THE ODDS.  SCANNING ...

                         MERC #1
               MURTAUGH?

                         MURTAUGH
               YES.
                    (BEAT)
               I'M ALONE.

                         MERC  #1
               HANDS UP.  COME WITH US.

                         MURTAUGH
               SHOW ME THE GIRL.

                         MERC  #1
               SHE'S  NOT   HERE.

                         MURTAUGH
               BULLSHIT.  LET ME SEE HER.  THEN
               I  COME   QUIETLY.

     THE MERC NODS.

113  VAN                                                              113

     INSIDE, RIANNE IS GAGGED, HELPLESS.  SHE LOOKS TERRIFIED.
     NEXT TO HER, MR. JOSHUA HBLDS A COCKED PISTOL.  MERC #1
     LEANS IN:

                         MERC #1
               HE WANTS TO SEE THE GIRL.

115  BACK OUTSIDE                                                     115

     MURTAUGH  WAITS.  SWEATING.   HANDS   IN   POCKETS.   AND   OUT
     COMES RIANNE, FOLLOWED BY THE VICIOUS MERC.  HE HOLDS A
     KNIFE SQUARELY AT HER THROAT.  MURTAUGH'S EYES FILL WITH
     TEARS.  RELIEF THAT SHE'S ALIVE..

                         MERC  #1
               SIMPLE EXCHANGE.  YOU COME WITH
               US, THE GIRL TAKES A WALK.

                         MURTAUGH
               LET  HER  GO  NOW.

                         MERC  #1
               NO.  TAKE YOUR HANDS OUT OF YOUR
               POCKETS.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (SHRUGS)
               SURE THING, PAL...

     HE SLOWLY RAISES HIS HANDS.  IN HIS LEFT HAND, HE
     CLUTCHES  A  SHINY  METAL   SPHERE.   A   GRENADE.   MURTAUGH'S
     GRIP IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING IT DEAD.  THE MERC SWEARS
     VIOLENTLY.

                         MURTAUGH
               THIS FUCKER'S ALIVE.
                    (BEAT)
               LET HER GO OR WE ALL DIE.

     AND THAT'S WHEN MR. JOSHUA STEPS OUT OF THE CAR.  DEADLY
     CALM.  ALL HEADS TURN.  CREWCUT-  MIRRORED SUNGLASSES.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               TAKE HIM.

                         MERC #1
               BUT SIR ...

                         MR. JOSHUA
               HE'S BLUFFING, IT'S A DUD.  HE
               WOULDN'T RISK KILLING HIS
               DAUGHTER.

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T PUSH  ME.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               TAKE HIM.

116  EXT. HILLTOP  - MEANWHILE                                  116

     FAR AWAY.  THE CAR AND THE SURROUNDING FIGURES ARE TINY.
     A LONE SOLDIER CROUCHES.  RIGGS.  THE RIFLE IS ON HIS
     SHOULDER.  HIS EYE IS GLUED TO THE SCOPE.

117  INFRA-RED IMAGE SHOWS RIANNE AND HER CAPTOR                117

     RIGGS' CONCENTRATION IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.  LIKE A
     STATUE.  HE LICKS A FINGER.  RAISES IT, TESTING THE WIND.

                         RIGGS
               COME ON... COME ON...

118  BACK WITH MURTAUGH                                         118

     AS HE AND JOSHUA STARE EACH OTHER DOWN.  TENSE.  TENSE.
     HIS HAND CLUTCHES THE GRENADE.  MERC #1 PUSHES THE KNIFE
     INTO RIANNE'S THROAT.

                         MERC #1
               PUT THE PIN BACK IN.  DO IT.

     MURTAUGH SWEATS.  MR. JOSHUA BEGINS TO WALK FORWARD,
     GUN EXTENDED.  COOL AS ICE.  ANOTHER STEP.  SMILING ...

119  ON  HILLTOP                                                119

     RIGGS SITS DEAD STILL, FOCUSING THROUGH THE SNIPER
     SCOPE.

                         RIGGS
               COME ON... MOVE AWAY FROM THE GIRL ...

120  MURTAUGH                                            120

     JOSHUA STOPS IN FRONT OF MURTAUGH.  COCKS THE GUN.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               DROP THE FUCKING GRENADE.

                         MURTAUGH
               I DO AND WE DIE.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               NO.  I DON'T THINK SO.

     HE SIGHTS DOWN THE GUN AND PULLS THE TRIGGER:  ALL HELL
     BREAKS LOOSE. HERE'S  WHAT  HAPPENS:  BAM  --  !  THE  BULLET
     CATCHES MURTAUGH IN THE SHOULDER.  HE DROPS THE GRENADE.
     IT ROLLS, AND MERCS DIVE FOR COVER.  THE MERC HOLDING
     RIANNE TAKES A STEP BACK.  BINGO.

121  ON HILL                                                        121

     THE MERC DROPS.  JOSHUA'S HEAD SNAPS AROUND.  HE STARES
     OFF AT THE DISTANCE AND HISSES:

                         JOSHUA
               RIGGS ... !

     MEANWHILE, MURTAUGH ROLLS, COMES  UP,  GUN  IN  HAND.  FIRES,
     BAM

                         MURTAUGH

     THE BLACK SEDAN'S WINDSHIELD SPLINTERS.  THE CAR ROCKS
     WITH THE IMPACT AS THE DRIVER IS KILLED INSTANTLY.

125  GRENADE                                                        125

     CHOOSES THAT MOMENT TO EXPLODE, POOF ... INTO A CLOUD OF
     ORANGE SMOKE.  A SHOWER OF CONFETTI.

                         JOSHUA
               DUD!  IT'S A DUD!

126  RIANNE                                                         126

     IS RUNNING FOR THE CAR AS JOSHUA SWIVELS  IN  HER  DIRECTION,
     LINING UP THE UZI, FIRING A BURST --  UNTIL  A  BULLET  FROM
     RIGGS PARTS HIS HAIR, SENDS HIM DIVING TO  THE  SAND,  THE
     UZI SPROUTING FLAME -- AS RIANNE FLINGS OPEN  THE  CAR  DOOR,
     SCREAMS -- AT THE BLOOD-SPATTERED  CORPSE  WHICH  ROLLS  OFF
     THE STEERING WHEEL. BULLETS  BLAST  THE  CAR.  METAL  POPS
     AND BURSTS.  SHE JUMPS IN.

127  MURTAUGH                                                       127

     IS FLAT ON THE SAND, FIRING LIKE CRAZY, SHOT  AFTER  SHOT  --
     AS RIANNE FLOORS THE GAS, THE CAR PEELING OUT  IN  A'  STORM
     OF FLYING SAND AND DIRT.  DOOR OPEN.  ONE LEG HANGING
     OUT.  PLOWS INTO AN ATMED MERC.  HE FLIES UP ONTO THE
     HOOD, SPINS, STILL CONSCIOUS, AND TAKES  AIM  THROUGH  THE
     WINDSHIELD, RIGHT AT HER ...

128  ON HILL                                                        128

     RIGGS SWIVELS, LIGHTNING QUICK.

                         RIGGS
               NO.

     GRUNTS.  FIRES.

129  MERC ON HOOD                                                   129

     IS BLOWN OFF THE CAR.

130  RIANNE                                                         130

     SCREAMS, THE DEAD DRIVER SPRAWLED  AGAINST  ONE  SHOULDER,
     HER FOOT NAILED TO THE GAS PEDAL ... AS THE CAR LEAPS
     LIKE A KICKED DOG AND CAREENS OFF INTO THE DESERT.

131  ON  HILLTOP                                                    131

     RIGGS LINES UP FOR ANOTHER SHOT -- AND THERE IS A SOFT
     CLICK -- !  HE  WHIRLS.  THE  GENERAL  HAS  ARRIVED.  STAND-
     ING AT THE TOP OF THE HILL.  HIS M-16 IS COCKED AND
     LOCKED.

                         GENERAL
               YOU'RE NOT THAT FAST, SON.
                    (BEAT)
               DROP THE RIFLE.

     HE SPEAKS INTO A WALKIE-TALKIE.

                         GENERAL
               I GOT RIGGS.

132  ON DESERT FLOOR                                           132

     MURTAUGH MAKES A BREAK FOR IT, FIRING BLIND -- UNTIL THE
     GROUND BEFORE HIM LITERALLY EXPLODES WITH GUNFIRE.  THE
     EARTH IS CHOPPED TO TATTERS.  DIRT FLIES.  HE STOPS.
     PUFFING FOR BREATH.  RAISES HIS HANDS.  AS THE SMOKE
     CLEARS, MR. JOSHUA APPROACHES LIKE A DEINON THROUGH FOG.
     HE IS FLANKED BY TWO MERCS WITH UZIS-

                         JOSHUA
               A VERY NICE TRY.
                    (SPEAKS INTO
                     WALKIE-TALKIE)
               KENDO.  GET THE GIRL.

133  ON  HILLTOP                                               133

     RIGGS STANDS, HANDS OVER HEAD.  THE GENERAL STUDIES HIM
     THOUGHTFULLY.

                         GENERAL
               MARTIN RIGGS.  YOUR COMBAT RECORD
               IS THE STUFF OF LEGEND.

                         RIGGS
               SO IS YOURS.  GENERAL PETER
               MCALLISTER, COMMANDER OF SHADOW
               COMPANY.

                         GENERAL
               I SEE WE'VE HEARD OF EACH OTHER.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.  IT'LL ALMOST BE A SHAME
               WHEN I KILL YOU.

                         GENERAL
                    (LAUGHS)
               I DON'T THINK SO, SON.

134  DESERT FLOOR                                              134

     MR. JOSHUA SAYS TO MURTAUGH:

                         MR. JOSHUA
               YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN EVENING.

                         MURTAUGH
               GO SPIT.

     JOSHUA SLAMS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH A KARATE BLOW.  HE
     FALLS.

135  EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY                                      135

     RIANNE IS DRIVING TO SAVE  HER  LIFE.  SCREAMING  AT  THE
     TOP OF HER LUNGS, THE NEEDLE TOUCHING  90  AS  SHE  STRUG-
     GLES TO SHOVE THE MERC'S DEAD BODY INTO THE CORNER.
     SWERVING.  SCREAMING.  AT WHICH POINT

     THE SAND EXPLODES IN FRONT OF HER.

     SHE SHRIEKS. A HOWL OF  NOISE,  A  VERITABLE  ERUPTION  OF
     SAND AND DIRT, AND IT'S ONE OF  TWO  THINGS,  IT'S  EITHER
     ALIENS FROM SPACE, DESCENDING -- OR  IT'S  A  BELL  COBRA
     HELICOPTER.

     RIANNE SWERVES TO A HALT TO  AVOID  THE  DRONING  CHOPPER,
     WHICH HOVERS LIKE A BEHEMOTH, ROTORS THROBBING, AS
     RIANNE STUMBLES FROM THE CAR AND COLLAPSES IN A HEAP
     ON THE SAND.

     LOST, ALONE, HER TEARS INAUDIBLE  OVER  THE  HIGH,  CHURN-
     ING WHINE AS WE

                                           FADE OUT.

                                          FADE IN:

136  INT. BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT                                  136

     RIGGS IS NAKED.  HE IS MANACLED HAND AND FOOT.  CHAINED
     IN A BATHTUB FULL OF WATER.  AROUND HIM IS A DINGY CON-
     CRETE BASEMENT.  JOSHUA  STEPS  FORWARD.  BEHIND  HIM  IS
     KENDO, AN ORIENTAL MERCENARY.  HE IS WORKING ON A MECHAN-
     ICAL DEVICE OF SOME KIND.  CONNECTING WIRES.  RIGGS
     GRUNTS.

                         JOSHUA
               WELL, WELL.  LOOK WHO'S BACK FROM
               THE DEAD.

     RIGGS STRUGGLES AGAINST  THE  MANACLES,  SLOPPING  WATER.

                         JOSHUA
               PLEASE SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.  I
               BELIEVE YOU'LL NEED IT.

     RIGGS STOPS MOVING.  SCOWLS AT JOSHUA AND SAYS NOTHING.
     JOSHUA SMILES.

                         JOSHUA
               YOU'RE JUST IN TIME FOR A LOT OF
               PAIN.

                         RIGGS
               I'M THRILLED.

                         JOSHUA
               OH, YOU WILL BE.  I DARESAY
               YOU'LL BE ... SHOCKED.

     KENDO SNICKERS IN THE CORNER.

                         RIGGS
               WHO'S THE CHIN?

                         JOSHUA
               SHHH.  DON'T MAKE HIM MAD.

                         RIGGS
               MY MISTAKE. WHO'S  THE  PLEASANT
               ORIENTAL PSYCHOPATH?

                         JOSHUA
               HIS NAME IS KENDO, AND HE HAS
               FORGOTTEN MORE ABOUT  DISPENSING
               PAIN THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               TERRIFIC. LISTEN, GUYS,  CAN  WE
               GET SOME MISTER BUBBLE IN HERE ...

                        JOSHUA
               PLEASE SHUT UP.
                    (STUDIES RIGGS)
               MY, MY, LOOK AT ALL THOSE SCARS.
                    (BEAT)
               SEE, MARTIN, WE HAVE A  PROBLEM.
               SINCE WE HAVE MURTAUGH, WE REALLY
               DON'T EVEN NEED YOU.  BUT I
               BELIEVE IN BEING THOROUGH.

     ACROSS THE ROOM, KENDO THROWS A SWITCH.  A MECHANICAL
     HUMMING FILLS THE ROOM.

                         JOSHUA
               OUR PROBLEM -- AND YOURS, TOO
               IS THAT WE HAVE SOME
               MERCHANDISE TO DELIVER.  A RATHER
               LARGE SHIPMENT, WE'RE ALL VERY
               EXCITED.  IT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE,
               HOWEVER, IF WE SHOWED UP WITH THE
               GOODS AND FOUND OURSELVES
               SURROUNDED BY FIFTY COPS.

                         RIGGS
               THAT WOULD BE A SHAME.

                         JOSHUA
               INDEED.  SO YOU SEE, MARTIN, IT
               IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE FIND OUT
               HOW MUCH THE POLICE KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               WE DON'T KNOW SHIT.  YOU KILLED
               LLOYD BEFORE HE COULD TALK.

                         JOSHUA
               I WISH I COULD BELIEVE YOU.
               UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T.  SO, IF
               YOU'LL BE KIND ENOUGH TO TELL
               US ALL YOU KNOW, I WILL  KILL
               YOU QUICKLY.

                         RIGGS
               SUCH A DEAL, I SHOULD  WORRY.

                         JOSHUA
               OH, INDEED YOU  SHOULD.  SEE,
               MARTIN, YOU ------- TALK TO US ...

     HE GESTURES TO KENDO, WHO APPROACHES.  HE IS CARRYING A
     VERY OMINOUS DEVICE:  A SPONGE, ATTACHED TO A PORTABLE
     DRY-CELL BATTERY CASING ... JOSHUA FROWNS AT RIGGS.

                         JOSHUA
               DO YOU VOMIT?

                         RIGGS
               SOMETIMES.

     JOSHUA NODS.  SIGHS.

                         JOSHUA
               BACK BEFORE PRISON REFORM, THE
               STAFF AT SING SING INVENTED A
               RATHER UNUSUAL FORM OF PUNISHMENT.
               IT'S KNOW AS THE  HUMMINGBIRD
               TREATMENT.  ARE YOU FAMILIAR?

                         RIGGS
               PLEASE, NO TICKLING.  I  HATE
               TICKLING.

                         JOSHUA
               THE 'PATIENT' IS CHAINED NAKED
               IN A BATHTUB FULL OF WATER.  A
               BATH IS THEN ADMINISTERED USING
               A BATTERY POWERED SPONGE.  THE
               PAIN IS SAID TO BE SO EXCRUCIATING
               THAT AFTER TWENTY MINUTES MOST
               MEN ARE EITHER INSANE OR DEAD.

     RIGGS IS SILENT.

                         JOSHUA
               I THOUGHT YOU'D  LIKE IT.  I CAN
               OF COURSE, KILL YOU NOW.  SIMPLY
               TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               GUESS WE'RE IN FOR A LONG NIGHT.
               'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW SCRATCH.

                         JOSHUA
               WE'LL FIND OUT.  KENDO ... ?

     THE ORIENTAL MOVES FORWARD.  HE BRANDISHES THE SPONGE/
     BATTERY HOOKUP.  DIPS IT INTO A BUCKET OF WATER.  RIGGS
     IS SWEATING.

                         JOSHUA
               FEEL FREE TO  SCREAM.

                         RIGGS
               HAVEN'T YOU GUYS...   HEARD OF
               YULETIDE  CHEER... ?

     KENDO HITS RIGGS WITH THE SPONGE.  RIGGS SCREAMS.  A
     HIGH, LUNATIC SCREAM.

     THRASHES IN THE WATER, SPLASHING KENDO, WHIPPING FROM
     SIDE TO SIDE AS THE ROOM SPIRALS BACK AND FORTH OUT OF
     FOCUS.  KIDS, DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.  KENDO REMOVES THE
     DEVICE.  RIGGS FALLS BACKWARD.  THUMPS AGAINST THE TUB.
     SUCKING AIR.  MOANING.

                         JOSHUA
               MY GOODNESS.  NOW THAT WAS FUN,
               WASN'T IT?

     RIGGS LOOKS AT HIM.  DRIPPING HATE.

                         RIGGS
               I'M GOING TO KILL BOTH OF YOU.

                         JOSHUA
                    (LAUGHS)
               THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
                    (BEAT)
               ABOUT THE SHIPMENT ... ?

                         RIGGS
               FUCK  YOURSELF.

     KENDO DUNKS THE BATTERY..  RUN IT DOWN RIGGS' STOMACH.
     HE SCREAMS AGAIN, AS WE MERCIFULLY ...

     NO WINDOWS.  HARDWOOD FLOORS.  A SINGLE CHAIR IN THE
     CENTER OF THE ROOM.  ROGER MURTAUGH IS STRAPPED TIGHTLY
     TO THE CHAIR.  HIS FACE LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING HIS WIFE
     MAKES FOR DINNER.  BLACK EYES.  SWOLLEN JAW.  HIS SHIRT
     IS OFF, EXPOSING THE GUNSHOT WOUND IN HIS ARM.  THE
     GENERAL STANDS FACING HIM, FLANKED BY THREE MERCS.  THEY
     ALL WEAR HOLSTERED SIDEARMS.

               MUCH AS MR. LARCH ENJOYS PUNISHING
               YOU FOR IT.

     MR. LARCH, A BIG REDNECK WITH NO DISCERNIBLE COMPASSION,
     STEPS FORWARD.  POURS A BIG HANDFUL OF BAKING SALT FROM A
     CONTAINER.  PACKS IT INTO ROGER MURTAUGH'S GUNSHOT WOUND.
     MURTAUGH GROANS.  SHOUTS.  STRUGGLES.

     THE GENERAL LOOLCS ON WITHOUT BLINKING.

                         MURTAUGH

               THIS IS GOING NOWHERE.  MR.
               LARCH ... ?

     LARCH GRINS, LEAVES THE ROOM.  A PAUSE.  MURTAUGH SWEATS,
     GLARING OUT FROM SWOLLEN EYELIDS.  THE GENERAL NODS,
     SMILES.

139  INT. BASEMENT  -  BACK  WITH  RIGGS                             139

     AS  HE  GROANS  AND  COLLAPSE  BACK INTO THE TUB.  SPLASH.
     MOANS  FEEBLY.  BLOOD  DRIPS   FROM HIS NOSE.  SALIVA DROOLS
     FROM HIS LIMP MOUTH.  HE LOOKS HALF-DEAD, PROBABLY BE-
     CAUSE HE IS JUST THAT.  KENDO PULLS AWAY THE BATTERY
     SPONGE,  SAYS  TO  JOSHUA:

               HE KNOWS SHIT.  WE'RE SAFE.

140  INT. DINGY BACK ROOM - SAME TIME                            140

     THE GENERAL LEANS OVER MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH SWEATS.

                         GENERAL
               ANYTIME, ROGER.  ANYTIME.
                    (BEAT)
               SEE, THE THING OF IT IS ... WE KNOW
               WHERE YOU LIVE.
                    (FROWNS)
               IN FACT, MR. JOSHUA HAS BEEN KNOWN
               TO EXTERMINATE ENTIRE FAMILIES,
               WHEN HE GETS IN... ONE OF HIS
               MOODS.  OH, SPEAKING OF THAT --

     LARCH RE-ENTERS THE DINGY BACK ROOM.  THIS TIME HE'S  GOT
     MURTAUGH'S DAUGHTER RIANNE.  SHE IS CLAD ONLY IN A
     T-SHIRT AND BIKINI BRIEFS.

                         RIANNE
               DADDY ... PLEASE DON'T LET THEM
               HURT ME ... !

     MURTAUGH GOES NUTS.  STRUGGLES, WRENCHES, BANGS THE CHAIR UP
     AND DOWN AGAINST THE FLOOR.  NO USE.  HE IS COMPLETELY HELP-
     LESS.  SNARLS WITH RAGE:

                         MURTAUGH
               BASTARDS ... UNTIE ME AND I'LL
               KILL EVERY ONE OF YOU.

                         GENERAL
               PRECISELY WHY WE WOULD NEVER
               THINK OF UNTYING YOU.

     LARCH SHOVES RIANNE INTO THE CORNER.  SHE LANDS IN A HEAP.
     MURTAUGH IS SWEATING BUCKETS.  EYES DESPERATE.  THE
     GENERAL LEANS IN CLOSE:

                         GENEPAL
               IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING, SON, YOU
               BETTER PLAY BALL, 'CAUSE THE STAKES
               JUST WENT UP ...

141  INT. BASEMENT - SAME TIME                              141

     KENDO SWITCHES ON THE BATTERY AGAIN.  IN THE TUB, RIGGS'
     HEAD LOLLS BACK AND FORTH.  LISTLESS.  DEAD.  HIS EYES
     REFUSE TO FOCUS.  KENDO SHOWS HIM THE SPONGE.

                         RIGGS
                    (SLURRED)
               NO ... PLEASE ...

                         KENDO
               YOU DIE NOW, SERGEANT RIGGS.
               VERY SLOW.

     RIGGS  DOES  NOT  RESPOND.  STARES  INTO  SPACE.    KENDO   LEANS
     OVER THE TUB,  REACHES  IN  --  AND  THAT'S  WHEN  WE FIND OUT
     RIGGS  HAS  BEEN  FAKING.  HIS  EYES  FOCUS.   NO  LONGER HAZED.
     HE SNAPS HIS HAND  FORWARD  TO  THE  END  OF  THE  CHAIN.  GRABS
     KENDO BY THE  HAIR.  IN  THE  BLINK  OF  AN  EYE,  HE  SLAMS  THE
     MAN'S HEAD DOWN AGAINST THE PORCELAIN TUB.  KENDO'S   NOSE
     SHATTERS.  THE ORIENTAL TOPPLES OVER INTO THE TUB.  THE
     BATTERY DROPS  TO  THE  FLOOR.  RIGGS  IS  A  FUCKING  MACHINE:
     HE FLIPS THE CHAIN AROUND KENDO'S NECK AND WRENCHES.
     HARD.  HE GOES LIMP.  RIGGS IS NOT THROUGH YET.  HE
     BEGINS TO  HEAVE  AND  THRASH,  THRUSTING  AGAINST  THE  CHAINS
     -- MANEUVERING THE CORPSE ON TOP OF HIM.  SHIFTING IT.
     MOVING KENDO'S PANTS POCKET WITHIN REACH.  HE REACHES IN.
     SLOWLY, CAREFULLY, BRINGS OUT A SHINY SILVER KEY ...

142  INT. DINGY BACK ROOM --  SAME TIME                    142

     A LENGTH OF ROPE IS PULLED TAUT.  RIANNE'S BOUND HANDS
     ARE STRETCHED OVER HER HEAD.  LARCH HOOKS THE ROPE AROUND
     A PEG SET INTO THE WALL.  SHE IS HELPLESS.  MURTAUGH IS
     OUT  OF  HIS  MIND.  STRUGGLING  TO  BREAK  FREE.

                         GENERAL
               GOOD LORD.  VERY WHOLESOME-
               LOOKING GIRL.  YESSIRREEE.

                         MURTAUGH
               GODDAMMIT, I'VE TOLD YOU
               EVERYTHING!!!!

                         GENERAL
               WE'LL SOON KNOW, WON'T WE?

     LARCH APPROACHES RIANNE.  SHE SQUIRMS.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (BEAT)
               YOU TOUCH HER, YOU'RE DEAD.

                         GENERAL
               OH, SON, SPARE ME.
                    (BEAT)
               IT'S OVER, SERGEANT.  NO HEROES
               AROUND TO SAVE YOU ...

     HE PICKS UP A BASEBALL BAT.  TOSSES IT TO LARCH.

                         GENERAL
               MR. LARCH... SHE'S YOURS.

     RIANNE  SCREAMS.  MURTAUGH  SHOUTS.  STRAINS.  THE   CHAIR
     THUMPS UP AND DOWN, CREATING  AN  INSANE,  STACCATO  RHYTHM.
     THE  GENERAL  LAUGHS.  RIANNE  SHRIEKS.  HARROWING.   TERRI-
     BLE. A SCENE OUT OF HELL.  AND  THEN  THE  DEVIL  COMES  IN
     AND KICKS THE  DOOR  OFF  ITS  HINGES.  OKAY.  OKAY.  LET'S
     STOP FOR A MOMENT. FIRST  OFF,  TO  DESCRIBE  FULLY  THE
     MAYHEM WHICH RIGGS NOW CREATES WOULD  NOT  DO  IT  JUSTICE.
     HERE, HOWEVER, ARE A FEW POINTERS:  HE IS NOT FLASHY.
     HE IS NOT CHUCK NORRIS.  RATHER, HE IS LIKE A SLEDGE-
     HAMMER HITTING AN EGG. HE  DOES  NOT  KNOCK  PEOPLE  DOWN.
     HE DOES NOT  INJURE  THEM.

     HE SIMPLY  KILLS  THEM.  THE  WHOLE ROOM.  EVERYONE   STAND-
     ING. EXCEPT  FOR  --  THE  GENERAL, WHO DUCKS OUT A SIDE
     DOOR AND ESCAPES ...  RIGGS'  CHAIN MOVES LIKE A LIVE THING.
     SNAPPING HERE.  STRIKING THERE.    MERCS TRY TO  DRAW  THEIR
     GUNS -- AND SUDDENLY THEIR HANDS ARE SHATTERED WRECKS.
     ONE MERC DRAWS A  BEAD  ON  RIANNE, ALMOST GETS OFF  A  SHOT,
     BECAUSE RIGGS IS ACROSS THE ROOM.  WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT
     -- RIGGS THROWS THE CHAIN. IT  WRAPS  THE  GUY'S  NECK  AND
     KILLS HIM INSTANTLY. OUCH ... HE  GOES  DOWN,  FIRING  USE-
     LESS ROUNDS  INTO  THE  CEILING.  PLASTER  RAINS.  RIGGS
     SPINS, DIVES. SCOOPS  UP  THE  BASEBALL  BAT.  COMES  UP
     BESIDE AN ARMED MERC -- SWINGS THE BAT WITH HURRICANE
     FORCE. A SICKENING  IMPACT.  THE  BAT  BREAKS  IN  HALF.
     RIGGS SPINS, COMBAT-READY.  SCANS  THE  ROOM.  NO  ONE  LEFT
     TO KILL. USING ONLY THE  ELEMENT  OF  SURPRISE,  HE  HAS
     TAKEN OUT AN ENTIRE  ROOM  IN  HAND-TO-HAND  COMBAT.  HE
     STEPS IN FRONT OF MURTAUGH  WITHOUT  MISSING  A  BEAT.  CUTS
     HIM LOOSE WITH  A  BORROWED  KNIFE.

                         RIGGS
               WORK  YOUR  CIRCULATION.

     CROSSES TO RIANNE, CUTS  HER  FREE.  SHE  COLLAPSES  SOBBING
     INTO HIS ARMS.

                         RIGGS
               SSSHHH-  NO TIME.  COME ON.

     HE SCOOPS UP HANDGUNS,  THROWS  THEM  TO  MURTAUGH.  TAKES
     FOR HIMSELF A PUMP SHOTGUN, POSSIBLY  THE  SAME  ONE  USED
     AGAINST HIM EARLIER.  MURTAUGH STARES DUMBFOUNDED AT THE
     BODY COUNT.

                         RIGGS
               THEY'RE ALL DEAD.  LET'S GET
               OUT OF HERE.

143  EXT. HALLWAY -  SAME  TIME                             143

     THE THREE OF THEM.

     ON THE RUN, MOVING HARD AND  FAST.  THEY  SCRAMBLE  DOWN  THE
     HALLWAY, RIGGS IN THE LEAD, AS -- A  MERC  DUCKS  AROUND  THE
     CORNER, SEES THEM.  DUCKS BACK.  RIGGS FIRES THROUGH THE
     WALL, BLAM -- !  A CORPSE FALLS INTO VIEW.  THEY KEEP
     MOVING.  DOWNSTAIRS.  A-ROUND ANOTHER CORNER.  MOVING,
     MOVING.

     THE THREE OF THEM  KEEP  MOVING.  RUSHING  HEADLONG  TOWARD
     A SIGN MARKED EXIT. THEY MAY ACTUALLY MAKE  IT  ...  OR  NOT.
     FOR AT THAT MOMENT, MR. JOSHUA LOOMS  UP  BEHIND  THEM  AND
     TOSSES SOMETHING IN THEIR  DIRECTION.  DUCKS  BACK  OUT  OF
     SIGHT. IT'S A LIVE  GRENADE.  THE  GRENADE  HITS  THE  FLOOR.
     CLATTERS.  RIGGS STOPS INSTANTLY.  HE KNOWS THE SOUND.
     SPINS. DIVES. SCOOPS UP  THE  GRENDADE  AND  CHUCKS  IT  WITH
     ALL HIS MIGHT. IT BOUNCES  DOWNSTAIRS  AND  EXPLODES  AT  THE
     FOOT OF THE STEPS.

144  EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT                                          144

     JOSHUA SKIDS TO A HALT NEXT TO A SEDAN.

     HE SLAMS THE DOOR AND ROARS  OFF  DOWN  HOLLYWOOD  BOULEVARD.
     THE CROWD PARTS LIKE THE RED SEA.  PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING.
     AND SUDDENLY, THE DOORS BURST OPEN -- AS RIGGS, MURTAUGH
     AND RIANNE COME SKIDDING OUT ONTO THE SIDEWALK IN HOT
     PURSUIT.  MURTAUGH SHOVES HIS DAUGHTER BACK AS JOSHUA
     FIRES OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAR.  BULLETS LASH THE PAVE-
     MENT.  THE CROWD SHRIEKS.  THE CAR SCREECHES AWAY.

145  ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  145

     A BEAT COP COMES RUNNING UP,  AND  MURTAUGH  SHOVES  RIANNE
     IN HIS DIRECTION.  FLASHES HIS BADGE.

                         MURTAUGH
               GET HER OUT OF HERE.

146  ANOTHER ANGLE - MURTAUGH AND RIGGS                             146

     GO RUNNING AFTER THE CAR.  SIDE BY SIDE.  BEATEN.  BLOODY.
     NAKED FROM THE WAIST UP.  MURTAUGH FIRING HIS PISTOL.  SHOT
     AFTER BLAZING SHOT.

     RIGGS UNLOADING WITH THE M-16 ON THREE-SHOT MODE, THE
     MUZZLE FLASH BLINDING, THE NOISE DEAFENING -- UNTIL
     PEDESTRIANS SWARM SUDDENLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE.
     BLOCKING THEM. EXCEPT  MURTAUGH  WON'T  GIVE  UP.  HE  RUNS
     AFTER THE CAR, SHOUTING:

                         MURTAUGH
               OUT OF THE WAY.  MOVE.

     HIS GUN CLICKS  EMPTY.  HE  TOSSES  IT  ASIDE.  PULLS  ANOTHER
     FROM HIS WAISTBAND.  THE  CAR.  FAR  AWAY.  FIRES  FOUR  MORE
     SHOTS.  COLLAPSES IN THE STREET.  NEARLY' UNCONSCIOUS.
     CRAWLS FORWARD AFTER THE CAR, BLOOD  STREAMING  FROM  HIS
     BROKEN NOSE ... GOING ON SHEER  GUTS.  FINALLY  GIVES  OUT.
     SLUMPS IN A HEAP. RIGGS KNEELS BESIDE  HIM  AS  A  POLICE  CAR
     ROARS UP TO THEM, FLASHERS  SPINNING.  RIGGS  IS  A  MAN  POS-
     SESSED. WE PANA-GLIDE  WITH  HIM  AS  HE  RUNS  FORWARD.  M-16
     IN ONE HAND.  BADGE IN THE OTHER.

                         RIGGS
               GET AN AMBULANCE!!

     HE TAKES OFF AFTER THE JOSHUA'S CAR.  ON FOOT.  SOMEONE
     BETTER TELL THIS GUY TO LIGHTEN UP.  THE CAR IS FAR AHEAD,
     RACING ONTO A FREEWAY ON-RAMP.  RIGGS RUNS.  SWEAT POURS
     OFF HIM.  SEEING THE CAR ON THE RAMP, HE CHANGES DIRECTION.
     STARTS RUNNING AN INTERCEPT  COURSE.  LEAPS  OUT  INTO  THE
     STREET -- SPINS, AS A TRUCK  BLARES  OUT  OF  NOWHERE,  BRAKES
     SQUEALING, HORN  SHRIEKING.  SOMERSAULTS  OVER  THE  HOOD.
     LANDS.  KEEPS  MOVING.  BARRELS  ACROSS  THE  STREET.   FASTER
     NOW.  EVEN FASTER THAN BEFORE.  FEET POUNDING.  GUN
     SWINGING.  DASHING  OUT  ONTO  THE  FREEWAY  OVERPASS.  WHERE,
     WITHOUT STOPPING,  HE  PROMPTLY  JUMPS  THE  GUARDRAIL.  DROPS
     THROUGH SPACE ... AND LANDS, THUMP -- !  ATOP THE BIG
     GREEN FREEWAY SIGN.  SWINGS LIKE AN ACROBAT.  DANGLES
     FROM THE SIGN, TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.  LEVELS THE
     M-16 ONE-HANDED, SWITCHES IT TO FULL AUTO.  WAITS ...

147  BENEATH HIM                                                     147

     JOSHUA'S CAR COMES  SCREAMING  THROUGH  THE  UNDERPASS,  DOING
     EIGHTY. RIGGS UNLEASHES  THE  GUN.  IT  BLAZES  WITH  CRUEL
     FIRE. STPAFES THE BACK  OF  THE  CAR.  SURE  ENOUGH,  BLOWS
     OUT BOTH TIRES -- THROWING THE  VEHICLE  INTO  A  DEADLY  SKID
     -- SLEWING ACROSS THE FREEWAY  --  STRIKING  THE  GUARDRAIL
     AT SIXTY-PLUS. IT SLIDES  FOR  A  FULL  HUNDRED  YARDS,  SEND-
     ING UP A SHOWER OF  SPARKS.  THE  BACK  TIRES  DISINTEGRATE
     IN A TRAIL OF BURNING RUBBER.  THE CAR GRINDS TO A HALT.
     THE DOOR OPENS  AND  JOSHUA  ROLLS  OUT.  RIGGS  FIRES.  KICKS
     UP A CLOUD OF CEMENT  NEAR  THE  MERC.  JOSHUA  RETURNS  FIRE.

148  ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   148

     BIG CHUNKS OF THE.FREEWAY SIGN BLOW  OUT  NEXT  TO  RIGGS'
     .HEAD.  HE IS SHOWERED WITH WOODEN DEBRIS.

     RIGGS LOWERS THE GUN.  LETS GO AND DROPS TWENTY FEET TO
     THE PAVEMENT.  LANDS, ROLLS, COMES UP.  A CAR SWERVES
     AROUND HIM.  CRASHES INTO THE GUARDRAIL.  RIGGS DOESN'T
     EVEN LOOK.  INSTEAD, HE BEGINS TO WALK.  HE IS A FUCKING
     JUGGERNAUT.

149  UP AHEAD                                                    149

     JOSHUA TURNS, SEES RIGGS -- AND STOPS.

                         JOSHUA
               OKAY, YOU BASTARD, LET'S SEE
               WHO'S BETTER.

     THEY ARE SEPARATED BY PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS.  JOSHUA
     SNAPS HIS RIFLE TO HIS SHOULDER. EYES GLUED TO  THE  SCOPE.
     RIGGS SWINGS HIS OWN RIFLE INTO POSITION -- AND  WE'VE  GOT
     THE SHOWDOWN AT THE O.K. CORRAL. A  BATTLE  OF  WITS.  EACH
     ONE SCANNING THROUGH THE SCOPE.

     LOOKING FOR A CLEAR SHOT, AS CARS SWERVE AROUND AND
     BETWEEN THEM. THE CROSSHAIRS  SWEEP  THE  FREEWAY.  PERFECT
     CONCENTRATION.  RIGGS.  JOSHUA.  TWO SOLDIERS.  AND
     SUDDENLY, THE SHOT IS THERE:  JOSHUA SIGHTS IN ON RIGGS'
     POSITION. ONLY PROBLEM IS, RIGGS' RIFLE  IS  POINTED  RIGHT
     AT THE CAMERA. HE IS SIGHTED IN  ON  JOSHUA.  SIMULTANEOUS.
     THEY FIRE AT THE EXACT SAME MOMENT.  TWO SHOTS.  TWO
     DISTINCT RIFLE CRACKS.  RIGGS TAKES IT IN THE SHOULDER.
     BLOWN BACKWARD.  JOSHUA GOES DOWN, WINGED.  RIGGS.
     JOSHUA.  EACH LOOKS LIKE SHIT.  THEY STRUGGLE TO THEIR
     FEET ... AND THAT'S WHEN A CAR BACKS UP INTO RIGGS AT
     THIRTY MILES AN HOUR. BROADSIDES  HIM.  SENDS  HIM  FLYING.

150  UP AHEAD                                                     150

     JOSHUA RUSHES UP TO A STALLED CAR. THROWS  OPEN  THE  DOOR.
     YANKS OUT THE DRIVER, HOPS BEHIND THE  WHEEL.  ROARS  AWAY.

                                               CUT TO:

151  EXT. BUILDING - SAME TIME                                    151

     AN AMBULANCE SHUDDERS TO A HALT AND TWO ORDERLIES HOP
     OUT.  UNIFORMED COPS ARE STRUGGLING TO HOLD BACK THE
     CROWD.  ONE OF THE ORDERLIES RUSHES UP.

                         ORDERLY
               WHERE IS HE, OFFICER?

                         COP
               RIGHT OVER THERE.

     HE POINTS -- AND SUDDENLY FROWNS: THERE IS  NO  ONE  THERE.
     MURTAUGH IS GONE.  NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

                                                       CUT TO:

152  EXT. BACK ALLEY - SAME TIME                                   152

     A SLEEK BLACK VAN CAREENS AROUND THE CORNER.

152A INT. VAN                                                      152A

     A MERC IS DRIVING, FOOT GLUED TO THE PEDAL.  THE GENERAL
     SITS SWEATING IN THE BACK SEAT.

152B ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 152B

     THE HEADLIGHTS FLASH WILDLY AS THE CAR ROARS DOWN THE
     ALLEY.

     THE GENERAL STARES AHEAD, AND SUDDENLY ------- ...
     'CAUSE WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, THERE'S ROGER MURTAUGH.
     FIFTY YARDS AWAY.  STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.

153  ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 153

     THERE IS NO REASON FOR MURTAUGH TO BE STANDING.  HE IS A
     WALKING TESTAMENT TO MAN'S ABILITY TO BLOODY HIMSELF.
     AND HE'S PISSED... THE MERC  SEES  HIM,  SNARLS  --  PUNCHES
     THE GAS.  MURTAUGH HOLDS HIS GROUND.  HE CAN BARELY STAND.
     AND THEN HE DOES A PECULIAR THING:  HE EXAMINES HIS HAND.
     NO QUESTION.  A DEFINITE TREMBLE.  SCOWLS.  STRETCHES.
     CRACKS HIS NECK.

     SHIFTS FROM FOOT TO FOOT, STEADYING HIMSELF.  HE HAS ONE
     SHOT. THE NUMBERS ARE  FALLING,  IT'S  ALL  COMING  DOWN  --
     AND HE'S READY.  THE VAN COMES BARRELING IN.  DOING FIFTY.
     NOW OR NEVER...

                         MURTAUGH
               NO WAY YOU LIVE.  NO WAY.

     HE CROSS-DRAWS WITH LIGHTNING SWIFTNESS.  BAM.  THE
     REPORT IS DEAFENING.  THE WINDSHIELD PROMPTLY SHATTERS.
     AND THE MERC SPROUTS A NEAT THIRD EYE.  PERFECT SHOT.
     DEAD CENTER.  THE VAN SWERVES.  MURTAUGH STEPS OUT OF THE
     WAY.  DEADLY CALM.  AS THE VAN CAREENS PAST -- HE SALUTES
     THE GENERAL.  WATCHES, EXPRESSIONLESS ... THE CAR SLAMS
     INTO A TELEPHONE POLE AND ROLLS OVER.  GRINDING METAL.
     AN ERUPTION OF GLASS.  IT CONTINUES TO ROLL LIKE SOME
     GREAT BEAST, CRUMPLING  AND  FOLDING  LIKE  AN  ACCORDION...

     COMES TO REST, UPSIDE DOWN IN A SEA OF GLASS ...

153A INT. VAN                                             153A

     THE GENERAL IS PINNED BENEATH A CRUMPLED DOOR-FRAME,
     STRUGGLING TO BREAK FREE, AS FLAMES LICK UPWARD FROM THE
     RUPTURED GAS TANK...

     AND THEN THE GENERAL SEES SOMETHING WHICH RUINS HIS WHOLE
     DAY.

     THE MERC'S CORPSE,  SPRAWLED  OVER  THE  STEERING  COLUMN...     *
     WITH A SHINY METAL GRENADE ATTACHED TO HIS BELT.                 *
     FLAMES DANCE AROUND THE GRENADE.                                 *

     THE GENERAL SQUIRMS, STRAINS, YANKS FOR ALL HE'S WORTH...        *
     FINGERS REACHING OUT FOR THE GRENADE...........................  *
     FLAMES BURNING HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND...........................  *

     AND IT IS, AS THEY SAY, ALL SHE WROTE.                           *
154  EXT. ROADWAY                                                     154

     MURTAUGH IS WALKING LIKE A ZOMBIE.  AWAY FROM THE VAN.
     GUN HELD LOOSELY AT HIS  SIDE.  SUDDENLY  --  IT  BLOWS  SKY
     HIGH.  A TOWER OF FIRE.  BLOWS MURTAUGH FLAT.  KNOCKS
     HIM ASS OVER TEACUPS.  ECHOES DOWN THE STREET.  TURNS
     NIGHT INTO DAY FOR ONE  BRIEF  INSTANT.  AND  THEN  --  THEN
     SOMETHING TRULY  INCREDIBLE  HAPPENS.  FOR  THE  FIRST  TIME
     IN NEARLY A CENTURY -- IT BEGINS TO SNOW IN HOLLYWOOD.
     MURTAUGH LOOKS UP, A "WHAT THE HELL ... ?" EXPRESSION ON
     HIS FACE.  SURE ENOUGH --

155  HEROIN                                                           155

     IS SIFTING DOWN ON THE NIGHT AIR, TEN MILLION DOLLARS'
     WORTH... A CLOUD OVER THE ENTIRE' STREET.  SWIRLING IN
     THE BREEZE.

156  MURTAUGH                                                    156

     GETS SLOWLY TO HIS FEET, CHECKING FOR BROKEN BONES.  IF
     IT WASN'T BUSTED ALREADY, APPARENTLY IT'S OKAY NOW.  TIME
     PASSES.  A HAND RESTS ON HIS SHOULDER.

157  MARTIN RIGGS                                                157

     STANDS NEXT TO HIM.  COPS SWARM BEHIND THEM.  THE HEROIN
     SNOW CONTINUES TO FALL.  THE WRECK BURNS.  RIGGS LOOKS AT
     MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH LOOKS AT RIGGS.  THE TWO MOST PHYSI-
     CALLY ABUSED MEN IN FILM HISTORY.

                         MURTAUGH
               WELL, SHIT.

                         RIGGS
               TRY NOT TO BREATHE, YOU'LL SEE
               PINK ELEPHANTS.

                         MURTAUGH
               JOSHUA?

                         RIGGS
               GOT AWAY.

                         MURTAUGH
               WE ... GOTTA FIND HIM.

                         RIGGS
               NO DICE.  FIRST THING WE GOTTA DO
               IS GET YOU TO A HOSPITAL.

                         MURTAUGH
               UH-HUH  FIRST THING WE GOTTA DO
               IS CHECK ON MY HOUSE.
                    (BEAT)
               I GOT A BAD FEELING...

     HE MOVES AWAY.  RIGGS STARTS TO FOLLOW.  GOES TO TOSS HIS
     CIGARETTE IN THE GUTTER, AND STOPS:  THERE IS A TINY, RED
     MARK AT THE TIP OF THE FILTER:  IT IS THE CIGARETTE.  THE
     VERY LAST ONE ... HE STARES AT IT, A SUDDEN GLIMMER IN HIS
     EYE.

                                             CUT TO:

158  EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT                                  158

     THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS SHED A HAPPY GLOW.  THE LAWN IS
     STILL LITTERED WITH TOYS.  TWO UNIFORMED COPS ARE WATCH-
     ING OVER THE HOUSE, SITTING IN A POLICE CAR ACROSS THE
     STREET.  ONE OF THEM MUNCHES ON A SANDWICH.  THE OTHER
     IS DOING A CROSSWORD PUZZLE.  A CAR PULLS UP NEXT TO
     THEM.  THE DOOR OPENS -- OUT STEPS MR. JOSHUA.

                         POLICE OFFICER
               EXCUSE ME, SIR, MAY I SEE SOME
               ID?

     JOSHUA TAKES AN UZI FROM BENEATH  HIS  COAT.  NO  HESI-
     TATION. BLOWS  THEM  APART.  WALKS  FORWARD,  GUN  SMOKING.
     CROSSES THE LAWN TO THE FRONT DOOR.  KICKS IT TO
     SPLINTERS.

159  EXT. CITY STREET - SAME TIME                                   159

     A POLICE CAR PEELS AROUND THE CORNER.  TAKES OUT A
     SALVATION ARMY BUCKET, WHICH POPS LIKE A CLAY DUCK.
     COINS SHOWER EVERY WHICH WAY.

160  INT. CAR                                                       160

     MURTAUGH IS DRIVING LIKE A  LUNATIC.  BESIDE  HIM,  RIGGS
     HOLDS A HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS GUNSHOT WOUND.

161  INT. MURTAUGH HOME'- SAME TIME                                 161

     JOSHUA STALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY OF MURTAUGH'S HOUSE.
     STOPS IN FRONT OF THE BEDROOM DOOR.  HOLY JESUS ...   HE
     KICKS IT OPEN.  SPPAYS  THE  INTERIOR  WITH  GUNFIRE.  SHREDS
     THE MATTRESS, DICES  THE  PILLOWS.  TRASHES  EVERYTHING  IN
     SIGHT:  STAR WARS POSTERS.  STUFFED ANIMALS.  STEREO.
     EMPTIES AN ENTIRE CLIP OF  .9  MILLIMETER  SLUGS.  EXCEPT
     THE BED IS EMPTY. THERE  IS  NO  ONE  THERE.  JOSHUA  SNARLS.
     TURNS.

162  SERIES OF SHOTS                                                162

     KICKS OPEN ANOTHER DOOR.  TRIGGERS DESTRUCTION.  PLASTER
     AND WOOD FILL THE AIR IN  A  CLOUD.  ROOM  TO  ROOM.  SEARCH-
     ING. GROWING MORE AND MORE  ENRAGED  --  BECAUSE  THERE  IS
     NO ONE HERE TO KILL. HE IS BLOWING THE  SHIT  OUT  OF  AN
     EMPTY SANTA MONICA BUNGALOW.  HE BURSTS INTO THE ONLY
     ROOM HE HASN'T VISITED.  LIVING ROOM.  IT TOO, IS EMPTY.
     THERE IS A NOTE, HOWEVER.  TAPED  TO  THE  CHRISTMAS  TREE:
     BIG LETTERS.

     DEAR BADGUYS

     NO ONE HERE BUT US COPS.
     SORRY.

     -- THE GOODGUYS

     JOSHUA SWEARS. RUNS FOR THE  DOOR.  AND  A  POLICE  CAR
     DRIVES THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE  HOUSE.  PLOWS  INTO  THE
     LIVING ROOM, SHEARING BOARDS  IN  HALF,  BURSTING  WINDOWS,
     GRINDING TO A HAL-. IN A SEA OF  GLASS.  JOSHUA  SPINS,
     TRIGGERING THE UZI.-  STRAFES THE CAR.  A WITHERING FIRE.

     EMPTIES AN ENTIRE CLIP AT  THE  FRONT  WINDSHIELD,  DICING
     IT TO SMITHEREENS. WAVES THE  GUN  LIKE  A  WAND,  STRAFING
     X PATTERNS, FIRING ALL THE WHILE, COMPLETELY EXTINGUISH-
     ING THE CAR AND ALL LIFE WITHIN.  STOPS.  SILENCE.
     FLOATING DEBRIS.  JOSHUA LOWERS THE GUN.  BREATHING HARD.

     CROSSES  THE ROOM, HIS BOOTS CRUNCHING THROUGH BROKEN
     GLASS.   YANKS ON THE DRIVER'S DOOR.  IT FALLS LOOSE WITH
     A METAL  CLANG.

163  ANOTHER  ANGLE                                             163

     A COP'S  NIGHTSTICK HAS BEEN JAMMED AGAINST THE ACCEL-
     ERATOR PEDAL.  THE CAR IS EMPTY.

     JOSHUA SPINS, STARTLED
     STARES ACROSS THE ROOM

     AT MARTIN RIGGS, WHO SITS CALMLY  ON  THE  WINDOWSILL.

                         RIGGS
               HO, HO, HO.

     HE RAISES HIS GUN AND FIRES WITHOUT BLINKING.
     BLOWS THE GUN OUT OF JOSHUA'S HANDS.
     SMILES A BIG SHIT-EATING GRIN.

     JOSHUA TURNS AND DIVES THROUGH THE HOLE  IN  THE  WALL
     LANDS OUTSIDE, COMES UP RUNNING, BUT  SORRY,  NO  DICE
     BECAUSE THERE STANDS ROGER  MURTAUGH.  DRAWING  A  BEAD  ON
     JOSHUA'S RUNNING FIGURE.

                         MURTAUGH
               FREEZE, JOSHUA.

     JOSHUA STOPS DEAD. TURNS,  GROWLING  LOW  IN  HIS  THROAT.
     A FIRE HYDRANT, SHEARED OFF BY  THE  RUNAWAY  CAR,  SPRAYS
     WATER HIGH INTO THE NIGHTTIME  AIR.  THE  WIND  BLOWS.
     MARTIN RIGGS STEPS OUT OF  THE  HOUSE.  POINTING  THE  .38
     SPECIAL LIKE A FINGER OF DOOM.  STROLLS TOWARD MR.
     JOSHUA... THE GUN IS ROCK  STEADY.  RIGGS'  EYES  MEET
     MURTAUGH'S, AND HE SPEAKS WITH DEADLY PURPOSE:

                         RIGGS
               I'LL HANDLE IT.

     HE STEPS UP TO JOSHUA.  SMILES.  AND  THEN  HE  DOES  SOME-
     THING VERY STRANGE: HE RELAXES HIS  GRIP  ON  THE  GUN  --
     AND THROWS IT AWAY.  FACES JOSHUA.  RAISES HIS ARMS, AND
     CAREFULLY PLACES THEM BEHIND  HIS  HEAD.  WHEN  HE  SPEAKS,
     HIS VOICE DRIPS MENACE:

                         RIGGS
               COME ON, ACE.
                    (BEAT)
               TRY ME.

     A MOMENT. THEN JOSHUA CALMLY PLANTS  HIMSELF  IN  FRONT  OF
     RIGGS.  AROUND THEM, WATER SHOWERS DOWN IN A GENTLE CLOUD.
     SIRENS APPROACH IN THE NEAR  DISTANCE.  JOSHUA  AND  RIGGS.
     TWO SOLDIERS.  THEIR EYES LOCK.  AND YOU BETTER HANG ONTO
     YOUR POPCORN, BOYS AND GIRLS, BECAUSE IT'S  ABOUT  TO  GET
     UGLY.

                         JOSHUA
               DON'T MIND IF I DO.

     AND SO IT BEGINS.  THEY START TO CIRCLE.

     RIGGS AND JOSHUA, PERFECT CONCENTRATION,  ROUND  AND  ROUND
     AND NEVER, NEVER ONCE DOES THEIR FOCUS BREAK, BECAUSE,
     BABY, THESE GUYS ARE PROS -- AND  HERE'S  SOMETHING  FUNNY:
     THEY AREN'T LOOKING AT EACH OTHER'S  EYES  AT  ALL.  RATHER
     -- THEY'RE WATCHING EACH OTHER'S HANDS.

164  RIGGS                                                        164

     HIS FINGERS TWITCH. FLEX.  WRIST  MAKING  SLOW,  LABORIOUS-
     CIRCLES.

165  JOSHUA                                                       165

     SHIFTING FROM LEG TO LEG, FLOATING HIS BALANCE.

166  MURTAUGH                                                     166

     LOOKS ON, SWEATING IT OUT. HE'S  NOT  HAPPY,  HE  WANTS  TO
     END IT ... AND YET HE WAITS.

167  RIGGS AND JOSHUA                                             167

     ALL WE SEE IS THEIR  EYES,  STRAINING,  FOCUSING,  SCANNING
     FOR AN OPENING.

                         JOSHUA
               CONCENTRATE, MARTIN... DON'T GIVE
               ME AN OPENING... WOULDN'T WANT TO
               DO THAT ...

     RIGGS SHIFTS.  BLINKS.  AND:

168  JOSHUA                                                       168

     SPRINGS ... FOOT COMING OUT  LIKE  A  SHOT,  RIGGS  JERKING
     BACK, INCHES -- MEANWHILE,  RIGGS  --  COUNTERMOVE,  SPINS,
     TRIES A BACK KICK, NO DICE ... JOSHUA NO LONGER THERE,
     WHERE IS HE ... ? SHIT -- ! COMES UP,  DARTS  A  PUNCH  TO
     DOESN'T    L=
-----------------------------

                                                       (CONTINUED)

          RIGGS' NECK -- RIGGS FIELDS IT, SNAP
          THE LEP-.  IT COMES OU@T OF NOWHERE.

-------------------------------

     CRACK!  THE SOUND OF RIGGS' RIB BREAKING CARRIES CLEARLY.
     HE GRUNTS.  THRUSTS, INVITING A COUNTERMOVE ... JOSHUA
     COUNTERS -- AND RIGGS SNAGS HIS HAND, PICTURE-FUCKING-
     PERFECT.  BREAKS ONE OF JOSHUA'S FINGERS.  OUCH.  BACKS
     OFF.  JOSHUA BACKS OFF.  THE TWO OF THEM.  WOUNDED, THEY
     CIRCLE.  ROUND TWO ...

169  MURTAUGH                                                      169

     MEANWHILE, IS RAISING HIS GUN, POINTING IT AT JOSHUA.
     RIGGS' VOICE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE:

                         RIGGS
               NO. ROGER.
                    (BEAT)
               NO WAY.

     MURTAUGH LOWERS THE GUN.  STARES, FASCINATED, AT THIS
     CONTEST BETWEEN TWO CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONALS.  IN FOR THE
     KILL.  IT IS A DANCE OF THE FORCES.  RIGGS IS ON FIRE.
     LEAPS, AVOIDING A SHOT TO THE KNEE, SPINS, SLAMS THE
     KNUCKLES OF HIS HAND INTO JOSHUA'S NOSE.  BUSTS IT.
     JOSHUA SNARLS, DROPS -- CATCHES RIGGS' ARM OVER ONE
     SHOULDER.  AND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... RIGGS HAS JUST
     FUCKED UP.  CRACK -- !  HIS ARM BREAKS.  HE SCREAMS WITH
     PAIN.  SCREAMS WITH ANGER.  TOSSES THREE SHOTS AT JOSHUA.
     SNAP.  SNAP.  SNAP.  RIBS, SPLINTERING.  JOSHUA HISSING
     WITH PAIN.  LETS GO.  BACK OFF (RIGGS).  BACK OFF (JOSHUA).
     IN PAIN, THEY CIRCLE.  ROUND THREE ...

                         JOSHUA
               THAT'S IT, MARTIN... YOUR BODY
               WANTS TO GO INTO SHOCK... BUT YOU
               WON'T LET IT, WILL YOU ... ?

                         RIGGS
               ...  GIVE IT UP ... YOUR BREATHING'S
               SHOT  ...

                         JOSHUA
               SO'S YOUR LEFT ARM...

                         RIGGS
               LIFE'S TOUGH THAT WAY ... OH, BY
               THE WAY:  FUCK YOU.

     HE LAUNCHES HIMSELF AT JOSHUA.  JOSHUA STRIKES, SCORES A
     MINOR POINT, BREAKING RIGGS' COLLARBONE, EXCEPT RIGGS
     DOESN'T CARE, NOSIRREE BOB... 'CAUSE HE JUST HIT PAYDIRT:
     JOSHUA'S KNEE.  BOOT-STRIKES, BAM -- !  SHEARING THE
     KNEE, MAYBE BURSTING THE CAP ... JOSHUA SHRIEKS, BUT THEN
     AGAIN, SO WOULD YOU.  AND HE PROMPTLY JACK-KNIVES HIS
     FIST RIGHT INTO RIGGS' BROKEN ARM.  THREE TIMES.  RIGGS
     BELLOWS.  REFUSES TO QUIT.

     SLAMS HIS HEAD INTO JOSHUA'S BUSTED NOSE.  POP ...
     DOES IT AGAIN. JOSHUA, HAMMERING THE  BROKEN  ARM.  POW.
     (SCREAM)  POW.  (SCREAM) ... UNTIL, SON OF A BITCH... THE
     PAIN IS SIMPLY TOO INTENSE... NOTHING HUMAN CAN WITHSTAND
     IT, THEY FALL AWAY, STAGGERING, WRENCHING TO A SHAKY HALT,
     FACING ONE ANOTHER, STANDOFF ... EXHAUSTED, LIMPING, HARDLY
     ABLE TO SPEAK...

170  POLICE CARS                                                  170

     PULLING UP NOW, COPS STUMBLING OUT, GUNS CLEARING  THEIR
     HOLSTERS AS MURTAUGH WAVES FRANTICALLY, SCREAMS:

                         MURTAUGH
               NO GUNS.  LET IT GO!  GODDAMMIT,
               LET IT GO!!

171  RIGGS                                                        171

     SPITS, GAZES STRAIGHT AT JOSHUA.  JOSHUA STARES BACK.
     TWO SOLDIERS.  THIS CLOSE TO COLLAPSING.  UNTIL, BREAKING
     THE SILENCE -- COMES MURTAUGH'S VOICE:

                         MURTAUGH
               MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.

                            MURTAUGH
               -----------
               THE MOTHERFUCKER.

     A MOMENT ... AND THEN, MY FRIENDS, RIGGS DOES A PECULIAR
     THING:  HE SMILES THEN.  DAMNED IF HE DOESN'T.  AND RISES
     UP ... STANDING. STANDING STRAIGHT. THERE IS NO  WAY  HE
     SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS.  AND THEN HE SPEAKS, AND IT'S
     LIKE THE VOICE OF DOOM, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE KNOW THAT
     THIS GUY IS A FUCKING LEGEND, WE KNOW WHY THE V.C. EN-
     FORCERS WHISPERED HIS NAME AT NIGHT IN THE FOXHOLES ...
     HE IS RIGGS.  AND NO ONE CAN TOUCH HIM.  NO ONE.

                         RIGGS
               LAST CHANCE.  WALK AWAY.

                         JOSHUA
               FUCK YOURSELF.

                         RIGGS
               FINE.  DIE.

     HE STEPS FORWARD.  STANDS.  JOSHUA SPRINGS -- THUNDERS
     HIS FOOT INTO RIGGS' HIP, SEPARATING THE BONE AT THE
     JOINT ... AND RIGGS DOESN'T BLINK.  HIS HAND COMES OUT.
     LIGHTNING QUICK.

     THERE IS A SICK-SOUNDING CRACK -- AND JOSHUA IS DEAD
     BEFORE HE HITS THE GROUND.  RIGGS HOVERS OVER THE
     CORPSE... BREATHING SPASTIC, SALIVA DRIPPING FROM HIS
     LIPS... TAKES A HANDKERCHIEF, WIPES HIS HAND, AND SAYS:

                         RIGGS
               YOU LOSE.

     AT WHICH POINT, HE COLLAPSES LIKE A SACK OF GRAIN.

172  MURTAUGH                                                         172

     IS RUNNING FORWARD, TEARS IN HIS EYES BY THIS TIME, FALLS
     TO HIS KNEES, CRADLING RIGGS IN HIS ARMS, WHILE THE
     ASSEMBLED COPS LOOK ON IN THOROUGHLY STUNNED SILENCE,
     WHAT THEY HAVE JUST SEEN IS BEYOND THEIR WILDEST
     IMAGINING ...

173  ON GROUND                                                        173

     RIGGS LOOKS AT MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH LOOKS AT RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               TAKE IT EASY, MARTIN...

                         RIGGS
               ... RIGHT.  EASY.  YOU BET ...

                         MURTAUGH
               DOES IT HURT ... ?

     RIGGS  THROWS  HIM  A  LOOK.

                         RIGGS
               WHAT ARE YOU, AN IDIOT?

                         MURTAUGH
               SORRY.

                         RIGGS
               S'ALL RIGHT.
                    (BEAT)
               I GOT GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S THE GOOD NEWS?

                         RIGGS
               ... GOOD NEWS IS, I'M NOT DEAD...

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?

     RIGGS GRIMACES IN PAIN-

                         RIGGS
               ... BAD NEWS IS, I'M STILL ALIVE ...

     HE CHUCKLES.  GROANS.  PASSES OUT.  THE WATER RAINS
     STEADILY DOWN.  THE NIGHT WEARS ON...

     CUT TO:

174  EXT. LONG BEACH BAR - DAY                                  174

     CHRISTMAS CAROLERS SING OUTSIDE AT ROADSIDE.  A BIG
     BANNER SCREAMS MERRY CHRISTMAS TO PASSING CARS.  CHRIST-
     MAS LIGHTS.  TINSEL.  MURTAUGH AND RIGGS STAND ON THE
     SIDEWALK, HUDDLED AGAINST THE CHILL.  RIGGS STANDS,
     BRACED ON ONE CRUTCH.  ARM IN A SLING.  THEIR BREATH
     PLUMES OUT IN FRONT OF THEM.

                         MURTAUGH
               SO.

                         RIGGS
               SO.

                         MURTAUGH
               THERE ARE WORSE THINGS THAN A

                         MURTAUGH
               GUESS I WON'T BE SEEING YOU
               AROUND.

                         RIGGS

                    (BEAT)
               THE DEPARTMENT THINKS I'M WILD.
               I DON'T BELONG ANYMORE.  NOT
               HERE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHERE DO YOU BELONG?

                         RIGGS
               WHO KNOWS ... ?  MAYBE I CAN GET
               A JOB ON A REMAKE OF COBRA.

                         MURTAUGH
               MY SON WOULD COME SEE YOU.

                         RIGGS
               HE'D BE THE ONLY ONE.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (A PAUSE;
                     THEN)
               RIGGS.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               THIS ... IS A BAD OLD WORLD,
               ISN'T IT?

                         RIGGS
                    (SIGHS)
               YEAH.  SOMETIMES IT REALLY IS.

                         MURTAUGH
               HELL.
                    (BEAT)
               I'M THINKING OF QUITTING.

                         RIGGS
               DON'T  YOU  DARE.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT HIM.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE TOO OLD TO CHANGE NOW,
               COLCHISE.

                         MURTAUGH
               ME?  OLD... ?

                         RIGGS
               YOU JUST HANG IN THERE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  YOU, TOO.

                         RIGGS
               GUESS I'LL SAY GOODBYE.

                         MURTAUGH
               SURE.  COME OVER FOR DINNER
               SOMETIME.

                         RIGGS
               NO, THANKS.

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T BLAME YOU.  I'M THINKING
               OF ARRESTING MY WIFE FOR CRUELTY
               TO BACON.
                    (BEAT)
               MERRY CHRISTMAS, MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               MERRY CHRISTMAS.

     HE WALKS OFF DOWN THE STREET.  MURTAUGH WATCHES HIM GO.
     PAUSE.  TURNS UP HIS COLLAR AGAINST THE CHILL, TAKES A
     FEW STEPS ... AND A MAN STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM.  THE SAME
     PUNK WHO RIGGS BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF AT THE VERY BEGINNING
     OF THE FILM.

                         PUNK
               HEY, OLD MAN, GOT ANY MONEY?

     MURTAUGH STOPS.  STARES.  BLINKS.  AND PROCEEDS TO KICK
     THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.  A KICK.  A PUNCH.  THE PUNK LIES
     ON THE SIDEWALK, SEMI-CONSCIOUS.  MURTAUGH SCOWLS AND
     SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M FIFTY.  THAT'S NOT OLD,
               DICKLESS.

175  EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK (SAME DAY)                            175

     RAIN POURS DOWN. MARTIN RIGGS STANDS OVER A  LONE  GRAVE.
     THERE ARE DARK HOLLOWS UNDER HIS EYES. THE WIND  TUGS  AT
     HIS HAIR.  THE TOMBSTONE READS:

     VICTORIA LYNN RIGGS

     BORN:  1953
     DIED:  1984

     HE REACHES BENEATH HIS OVERCOAT AND REMOVES A BRIGHT
     GREEN CHRISTMAS WREATH, WHICH HE PLACES ATOP THE GRAVE.
     KISSES HIS FINGERTIPS. PRESSES THEM TO THE  MOIST  EARTH.

                         RIGGS
               MERRY CHRISTMAS.
                    (BEAT)
               I LOVE YOU.

     THE RAINS STARTS TO FALL.  RIGGS IS OBLIVIOUS.

176  EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT                                 176

     CARPENTERS ARE AT WORK, PATCHING AND REPAIRING.  THE
     CHRISTMAS LIGHTS STILL SHINE DEFIANTLY. A CAR PULLS  UP.

                                                       CUT TO:

177     FRONT  DOOR                                           177

     AS A HAND KNOCKS SOFTLY:  THE DOOR OPENS -- AND THERE
     STANDS YOUNG RIANNE.  ADORABLE.  SHE LOOKS UP AT THE
     VISITOR... IT IS MARTIN RIGGS.

                         RIANNE
               HI.

                         RIGGS
               HI.

     HE HANDS SOMETHING TO HER.  SHE TAKES IT.  THE BOTTLE OF
     PILLS.  IT HAS A RED RIBBON TIED AROUND IT.

                         RIGGS
               GIVE THAT TO YOUR DAD.  IT'S A
               PRESENT.  TELL HIM I WON'T BE
               NEEDING THEM ANYMORE.

     RIANNE NODS.

                         RIANNE
               OKAY.  YOU WANNA COME IN?  WE'RE
               BUILDING.

     RIGGS THINKS IT OVER.  SHAKES HIS HEAD:

                         RIGGS
               NO, THAT'S OKAY.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS,
               MISSY.

                         RIANNE
               OKAY.

     RIGGS TURNS TO GO.  RIANNE STOPS HIM:

                         RIANNE
               THEY SAY YOU'RE THE BEST.

     BEAT.  HE STOPS.  TURNS AND LOOKS AT HER.

                         RIANNE
               ARE YOU?

                         RIGGS
                    (BIG SMILE; WILD WINK)
               NO ONE CAN TOUCH ME.

     RIANNE BLUSHES.

     RIGGS BEGINS TO WALK AWAY, INTO THE RAIN...

     UNTIL ROGER MURTAUGH APPEARS FROM INSIDE THE BOAT ON THE
     TRAILER HITCH.

     HE STANDS ON DECK AND LOOKS DOWN AT RIGGS.

     RIGGS STOPS.  THEY STAND THERE IN THE RAIN FOR A MOMENT.
     THEN MURTAUGH LOOKS HIM SQUARE IN THE EYE AND SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               SUCKER, IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA CAT
               THE WORLD'S LOUSIEST CHRISTMAS
               TURKEY ALL BY MY LONESOME, YOU'RE
               NUTS.

     RIGGS NODS.  A MOMENT PASSES.  THEN:

                         RIGGS
               I THINK YOUR DAUGHTER KINDA LIKES
               ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU TOUCH HER, I'LL KILL YOU.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'LL TRY.

     HE SMILES.

     MURTAUGH SMILES.

     THE RAIN FALLS, AS THEY ENTER THE HOUSE TOGETHER, AND
     WE

                                                  FADE OUT.

LETHAL WEAPON 2

GOD! I LOVE THIS JOB! MAN! CAN'T YOU GO ANY FASTER?

FLOOR THIS THING!

IT'S MY WIFE'S. I WON'T GO FASTER.

YOU'RE DOING 65 NOW.

65?! S***!

GET YOUR FOOT OFF THE PEDAL! YOU'RE KILLING MY CORN!

WE'RE EASTBOUND ON 4TH, IN PURSUIT OF A RED BMW, DRIVER CAUCASIAN, BLONDE.

PLATE 2-BOY-ADAM-HENRY-174.

YOU ARE WESTBOUND ON 2ND. 20 WILLIAM 12 IS SOUTHBOUND.

YOU'RE HEADING STRAIGHT TOWARD EACH OTHER.

- SOMEBODY BACK OFF. - GOT IT.

- WHAT'D SHE SAY? - WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT.

GO! WE'LL STICK WITH THE RED BASTARD. YOU CHASE THE BLUE.

THAT'S CONFIRMED. YOU GOT RED, WE'LL GET BLUE.

- WHAT'S THE PURSUIT? - 20 WILLIAM 15 AND 20 WILLIAM 12.



- THAT'S RIGGS, MURTAUGH. - AND THEIR SQUAD.

- $20 ON RIGGS AND MURTAUGH. - WHO'S DRIVING?

MURTAUGH, IN HIS WIFE'S WAGON.

I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE WAGON. BET'S OFF.

SHUT UP!

WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

WHAT F***IN' LANGUAGE IS THAT?

IT'S GERMAN.

JAPANESE?

IT'S A JAPANESE RADIO. MAYBE THEY BOUGHT THE L.A.P.D.

THEY OWN EVERYTHING.

SHOTGUN!

SHOTS ARE BEING FIRED.

THANKS FOR THE SCOOP.

THE BASTARD SHOT MY WIFE'S WINDSHIELD.

ENTERING THE PURSUIT.

OH, S***, MAN! WE'RE SPLITTING UP!

SON-OF-A-B***H! NOW WE'RE COOKING.

STEP ON IT!

LOOK OUT!

SEE YOU!

I'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR LICENSE AND PROOF OF INSURANCE!

WE GOT ONE. YOURS IS GOING UP THE HILL.

SO IS RIGGS, ON FOOT!

HEY, RIGGS! GET YOUR SLOW ASS IN HERE!

GET IN HERE, NOW!

ONLY IF I DRIVE.

MOVE OVER. I'LL DRIVE.

NO, GO AROUND. I'M DRIVING.

I'LL DRIVE.

DID YOU GET A MAKE ON THAT RED BEEMER?

NOT ONE SCRATCH, YOU HEAR?

- YOU WON'T MAKE IT. - I WILL.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM!

YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT!

LOOK AT MY SIDE PANEL!

GOD**** IT, YOU WERE RIGHT.

THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM.

HE'S TURNING RIGHT!

GET OUT OF THE WAY!

THIS WAS A NEW CAR, RIGGS.

WELL, IT STILL IS.

ON THREE.

ONE...

...TWO... THREE!

S***!

YOU FORGOT TO TURN YOUR INDICATOR ON.

WHERE THE HELL IS HE? THIS GUY'S MANDRAKE!

WHERE WERE YOU, MAN?! DAMN IT!

ME?! WHERE DID HE GO?!

- HE'S F***ING GONE! - I CAN SEE THAT!

- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COME ON "THREE". - I THOUGHT YOU MEANT, "THREE" THEN GO!

NO! WE ALWAYS GO ON "THREE"!

SOMETIMES WE GO, "ONE, TWO, THREE," THEN GO!

GO CHECK BACK THERE!

IF YOU SEE ANYBODY RUNNING OUT, JUST PUMP THE S*** OUT OF THEM.

WHAT WAS THAT?

- HE CRAWLED INTO THE TRUNK. - I GOT YOU COVERED.

HOLY CHRIST!

THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

IT'S GOLD!

GOLD!

KRUGERRANDS.

IT'S ILLEGAL. YOU CAN'T IMPORT THEM INTO THE COUNTRY.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

THE DAMAGE YOU CAUSED IS COMING OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET.

- PAY IT IN KRUGERRANDS. - DON'T MAKE JOKES, MAKE ARRESTS.

I WANT AN EXPLANATION.

- THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND. - YOU SAID THIS WAS A ROUTINE BUST.

YOU DIDN'T MENTION HELICOPTERS, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, KRUGERRANDS...

THIS WAS BIGGER THAN WE THOUGHT.

TALK TO YOU LATER.

I WORKED PSYCHO WARD. YOU'LL NEVER GET OUT.

ONE MINUTE, FIFTEEN SECONDS.

SHAPIRO, SCRATCH MY NOSE.

HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON? IS THIS KINDERGARTEN OR A POLICE STATION?

GET SOME WORK DONE.

HOUDINI JR. BETS HE CAN FREE HIMSELF IN 5 MINUTES.

I WILL TOO.

DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME, KIDS.

IT'S OVER NOW. PUT YOUR MONEY ON THE DESK AND GET BACK TO WORK.

SUCKERS.

HOW THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT?

I DISLOCATED MY SHOULDER ONCE. NOW I CAN DO IT WHENEVER I WANT.

DOESN'T IT HURT?

YEAH, IT DOES.

BUT NOT AS MUCH AS... WHEN I PUT IT BACK IN.

IF IT ISN'T MRS. SIGMUND FRAUD.

MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN, SERGEANT.

WE SHOULD KEEP THIS ON A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL.

WHY THE HELL DO YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF?

WHO ELSE COULD I DO IT TO? NONE OF THEM WILL LET ME.

AND I NEED THE MONEY.

COUGH UP!

IT'S NOT ALL HERE YET. I WANT IT ALL.

WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF TO THIS STUFF! IT'S EVIDENCE. IT'S A KRUGERRAND.

- IT'S MINE. I WON IT. - IT'S NOT YOURS.

YOU WANT TO GET BUSTED?

WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

NOT TONIGHT.

- RIANNE'S COMMERCIAL IS ON. - SHE'S IN A COMMERCIAL?

NOT SO LOUD!

WHAT'S WRONG? I'D BE PROUD IF I WAS YOU.

I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET. WHAT IF SHE STINKS?

YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING. SHE'LL BE GREAT.

LISTEN UP!

TONIGHT AT... WHAT TIME?

COME ON!

WHAT TIME?

EIGHT.

EIGHT O'CLOCK, ON... CHANNEL?

EIGHT. THE SERGEANT'S DAUGHTER, RIANNE. HERE'S A PICTURE OF HER.

SHE'S GOING TO MAKE HER TELEVISION DEBUT IN A COMMERCIAL.

WITH THIS CROWD, BABY, YOU'D BETTER NOT STINK.

WHAT HAPPENED? THIS IS A NEW CAR. MOM'S GOING TO BE UPSET!

- IT'S STILL NEW. - NO, IT'S NOT, IT'S WRECKED.

I DON'T WANT YOUR MOTHER TO KNOW.

DO YOUR HOMEWORK TOO.

- HEY! I HAVEN'T READ THESE. - RIANNE PUT THEM THERE.

WHY DON'T YOU LOOK OUT FOR ME?

HEY, RICKY! I WANT TO USE MY DRIVEWAY ONCE IN A WHILE.

NICE OXYGEN TENT.

- DO I LOOK LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON? - NO, BUT YOU'RE BAD.

THIS IS A TWO-CAR GARAGE, AND THIS IS MY HOBBY ROOM UPSTAIRS.

I RETIRE WHEN I'M 52, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS KICK IN WHEN I'M 55.

YOU'RE NOT RETIRING, ARE YOU?

- I'VE THOUGHT OF IT, SINCE I MET YOU. - THANK YOU.

THIS IS A NICE HOBBY ROOM. ALL YOU NEED NOW IS A HOBBY.

JESUS!

WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

I'M SORRY. THAT'S VERY UNCOOL.

YOU'RE SORRY? CHECK MY SHORTS!

- DON'T YOU USE HAMMERS ANYMORE? - WHAT'S A HAMMER?

EASY. IT'S NO SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

GIVE IT BACK.

A MAN'S NOT EVEN SAFE IN HIS OWN HOME.

THEN STAY THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

YOU GOT ANY TRAFFIC WARRANTS?

CAN YOU FIX THEM?

ALMOST TIME. ARE WE TAPING THIS?

YES, SO WE CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

TAKE THE STAIRS.

NICK, GET YOUR FEET OFF THE TABLE. YOU TOO, MARTIN.

- THE COLOR'S NO GOOD. - IT'S FINE. YOU'LL MESS IT UP.

I WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD.

UNPLUG IT.

THAT'S YOUR SISTER!

PICTURE'S PERFECT.

YEAH?

DO I KNOW YOU?

YES, SIR.

WE HAD A LONG TALK ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

ABOUT WHAT?

YOUR NEW HOBBY ROOM.

THIS IS GEORGE.

DID YOU SENSE THAT I LIKED YOU?

YES, SIR.

SIT DOWN AND BE QUIET.

- WHAT ARE YOU EATING? - MY TUNA FISH SANDWICH.

TUNA?

YOU CAN'T EAT TUNA!

DAD KILLED FLIPPER.

WE'RE BOYCOTTING TUNA...

...BECAUSE THEY KILL THE DOLPHINS THAT GET CAUGHT IN THE NETS.

HAVE HAM.

EAT MISS PIGGY.

- I'M SORRY! - IT'S ONLY MY EYE.

OH, MY GOD! IT'S COMING ON!

MY BABY!

DON'T SHE LOOK GORGEOUS, MARTIN?

WHEN THE TIME HAS COME...

...AND THE MOMENT IS RIGHT...

...REMEMBER...

...USE RAMSES' EXTRA CONDOMS.

- WE DO! - RAMSES' EXTRA.

BECAUSE CARING MEANS ALL THE PROTECTION YOU CAN GET.

TAKE THE KIDS UPSTAIRS.

WE LEARN THIS IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT.

IN HUMAN WHAT?! HUMAN DEVELOPMENT WHAT?!

CHILL OUT, DADDY.

UPSTAIRS!

NICK, UPSTAIRS.

YOU KNOW HOW YOUR FATHER IS.

- I LOOKED FAT. - I LIKED YOU.

HOME. OUT!

I GOT A GUN.

WHAT? SHE LOOKED BEAUTIFUL.

I LIKED IT. SHE MADE ME WANT TO BUY RUBBERS RIGHT NOW.

I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. RIANNE, THAT WAS...

- I THOUGHT YOU WERE TERRIFIC. - REALLY?

I THINK SHE'S GOT A HELL OF A FUTURE.

GEORGE IS AFRAID. HE'S GOING HOME.

STICK AROUND.

HE HAS A GUN.

IT'S AN OLD GUN AND HE'S NOT A VERY GOOD SHOT.

THAT'S GOOD. I'M GOING ANYWAY. GOOD NIGHT.

- I'LL BUY YOU A BEER. - YOU LET HIM BUY IT.

YOU'RE UNDER 21. BE BACK BY MIDNIGHT.

WAIT AND SEE. COPS NEVER LET UP.

I'LL HAVE RUBBERS ON MY DESK, RUBBERS IN THE MAIL, IN THE COFFEE...

IF YOU'D ONLY KEPT YOUR MOUTH SHUT! I'M GOING FOR A WALK.

GIVE THE BOYS SOME CREDIT. IN ONE EAR, OUT THE RUBBER.

HOW GOES IT WITH YOU, HANS?

OKAY. YOU, PIETER?

THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH OF THAT. COME ON OVER HERE, HANS.

MIND THE PLASTIC. I'M HAVING PAINTING DONE.

THE IMPORTANT THING IS...

...ARE YOU OKAY?

NO BONES BROKEN?

I'M FINE, THANKS.

JUST BUMPS AND BRUISES, EH?

YEAH, THAT'S ALL.

GOOD, GOOD.

HOWEVER, WE LOST OVER $1 MILLION IN KRUGERRAND.

I KNOW. I'M SORRY, MR. RUDD.

IT HAPPENS.

IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

SOMETIMES THINGS DO NOT GO AS PLANNED.

AS YOU SAY, THEY JUST HAPPEN, EH, PIETER?

YOU GIVE A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO THE WORD, "DROP CLOTH. "

CERTAIN POLICEMEN HAVE BECOME AN INTOLERABLE NUISANCE.

THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY ON TO US AGAIN. HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO HANDLE IT?

WARN THEM OFF.

IT'S MY EXPERIENCE...

...THAT A SCARED COP IS MORE USEFUL THAN A DEAD ONE.

A WARNING?

IS THAT NOT A BIT TAME?

DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DO IT.

THEN YOU BETTER LOOK AT THIS.

THIS IS THE POLICEMAN IN CHARGE.

A KAFFIR.

LOVELY.

REMEMBER TO TAKE THESE IN ORDER.

THERE'S A PACKET FOR EACH DAY OF THE WEEK.

THIS YOURS?

I FOUND IT IN THE WASH.

I KEEP LOSING THIS.

SOMETHING'S WRONG.

NO, NOT REALLY. IT'S JUST A GOD**** PEN.

WHAT ABOUT THE PEN?

IT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING.

OF WHAT?

IT REMINDS ME OF...

...THE NIGHT VICKI WAS KILLED.

I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUSH.

THAT'S OKAY. WE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS.

I WAS TO MEET HER FOR DINNER. ONE OF THOSE ROMANTIC DINNERS FOR TWO.

I HAD SO MUCH WORK.

AND I FORGOT ABOUT IT.

SHE WAITED AT THE RESTAURANT FOR AN HOUR BEFORE SHE DROVE HOME.

IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN I GOT HOME TO A RINGING PHONE. I ANSWERED IT.

THEY SAID SHE WAS KILLED IN A CAR CRASH.

IF I'D BEEN DRIVING, WE'D HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT.

I REMEMBER FALLING DOWN ON MY KNEES AND SHAKING ALL OVER.

I REMEMBER THINKING, "I'M LOSING IT. "

THERE I WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR...

...AND I'M SEEING UNDER THE COUCH, AND I SEE THIS GOLD PEN.

JUST LYING THERE. I'D BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR TWO MONTHS. THERE IT IS.

SHE WASN'T A GREAT HOUSEKEEPER.

THIS VOICE GOES OFF IN MY HEAD, LIKE A DRILL INSTRUCTOR.

IT SAID, "GET UP! NOW!"

I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT, BUT I GOT UP. MUSCLES WERE STILL WORKING.

THEN I DROVE TO THE HOSPITAL...

...IDENTIFIED HER, SIGNED HER OUT WITH MY GOLD PEN.

TRISH FOUND A GOLD PEN IN THE LAUNDRY.

LOOK AROUND YOU, SAM.

ONE DAY, SAM...

...THIS'LL ALL BE YOURS.

FIND A NICE B***H, RAISE A COUPLE OF PUPS.

A MAN COULD BE HAPPY HERE.

ANYBODY TELL YOU IF YOU SIT ON COLD ROCKS TOO LONG, YOU GET PILES?

LET'S GO WATCH TV.

KAFFIRS!

WONDERING ABOUT YOUR KIDS?

ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE TO THEM?

IF I WAS YOU, I'D BE GOING NUTS NOW.

I'D BE GOING F***ING BANANAS.

WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'VE DONE?

SHALL I TELL YOU?

JUST LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN WILD.

THIS HAS JUST BEEN A WARNING.

AFTER THIS, IT GETS BLOODY. TELL YOUR PEOPLE TO BACK OFF.

DON'T BE A SMART KAFFIR.

MAYBE WE LET YOU LIVE, HUH?

- YOU DIDN'T SEE A FACE? - NOT ONE. THEY HAD ON HOODS.

WHAT ABOUT A VOICE?

THAT CRAZY MOTHERF***ER WHO DID TALK HAD A STRANGE ACCENT.

NOT GERMAN, NOT ENGLISH. KIND OF GUTTURAL. REALLY S****Y ACCENT.

WAIT. ANYTHING LIKE WHAT WE CHASED THE OTHER NIGHT?

YEAH, KIND OF LIKE THAT.

TRISH AND THE KIDS?

THEY'RE AT HER SISTER'S HOUSE IN BELLFLOWER.

LISTEN UP! YOU HEARD WHAT HAPPENED TO ROG LAST NIGHT?

FORENSICS GET BACK WITH ANYTHING?

NOT YET. THEY'LL KEEP US POSTED.

WE GOT TO WATCH EACH OTHER'S BACKS AND FRONTS.

YOU CAN ALL WATCH MY BACK IN POKER TOMORROW. YOU IN?

- IF WE CATCH THESE ASSHOLES. - COUNT ME IN.

I GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOU.

LEO GETZ HAS BEEN PLACED IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY.

YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BABY-SIT UNTIL WASHINGTON SENDS THE FEDS.

- HOW LONG? - UNTIL THE RED TAPE IS PROCESSED.

COUPLE, THREE DAYS.

GETZ IS GOING TO TESTIFY BEFORE A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY.

DRUGS, LAUNDERED MONEY, ETC.

I'LL BE THERE IN 10 MINUTES.

THIS IS NOT A S*** ASSIGNMENT.

- YES, IT IS. - NO, IT ISN'T.

IT ISN'T.

IT IS.

SHUT UP, BOTH OF YOU.

I'VE GUARANTEED HIS SAFETY.

WHY US?

YOU TWO ARE THE MOST QUALIFIED. AND...

...AFTER LAST NIGHT, YOU COULD USE THE BREAK.

I CAN HANDLE LAST NIGHT.

WHAT DO WE DO WITH HIM?

TAKE HIM TO DISNEYLAND.

THIS STINKS. THIS STINKS.

I DON'T GIVE A F***! I DON'T HAVE AN ULCER BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN TO SAY THAT.

HERE'S WHERE HE'S STAYING.

A NICE HOTEL. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS PAYING. ENJOY YOURSELVES.

ONE MORE THING.

KNOW WHAT THAT SAYS?

YEAH. SAME THING AS THAT, BUT I DON'T GIVE A F***.

YOU'RE LUCKY. I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT.

WHAT ROOM IS THAT FOR?

612.

THIS IS IT. 612.

POLICE.

HOW DO I KNOW THAT?

AFTER I SHOOT YOU, YOU CAN EXAMINE THE BULLET. OPEN UP.

DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE A BADGE?

- WHERE'S YOUR BADGE? - SHUT UP.

I GET IT. BAD COP, GOOD COP.

SHUT UP.

BAD COP, BAD COP. I KNOW THE ROUTINES.

- ARE YOU LEO GETZ? - THAT'S ME, LEO GETZ.

WHATEVER YOU NEED, LEO GETS. GET IT?

I USE THAT TO BREAK THE ICE WHEN I MEET PEOPLE.

I'M SGT. MURTAUGH, THIS IS SGT. RIGGS.

NICE TO MEET YOU. SO WHAT DO I CALL YOU GUYS?

SGT. MURTAUGH AND SGT. RIGGS.

WE'RE GOING TO BE YOUR SHADOW.

THAT'S FINE. HEY, AN OLD-FASHIONED...

OKAY. I JUST AIN'T SEEN ONE IN A LONG TIME.

I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE USED THEM ANYMORE.

I BET THE KID'S GOT AN AUTOMATIC. HAVE YOU?

YEP, A BERETTA.

YOU SURE YOU GUYS ARE COPS?

BETTER WATCH HOW YOU TREAT ME. I'M A STATE WITNESS.

STAR WITNESS.

WE'LL TAKE THAT ROOM.

I ALREADY HAVE MY STUFF IN THIS ROOM.

IT'S YOURS, OKAY? I'LL MOVE IT IN THE SMALL ROOM.

I'M THE SMALLEST GUY HERE. I'LL TAKE THE SMALL ROOM.

HEY, LOOSEN UP, GUYS! WE'RE GOING TO BE TOGETHER A LONG TIME.

I'LL GET IT.

IT'S ONLY ROOM SERVICE.

YOU HUNGRY? I'LL CALL FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT.

SEE THIS SILK ROBE? FREE.

- IT'S NOT FREE. - YES, IT IS.

- IT'S TAXPAYERS' MONEY. - SAME THING.

MORNING, GENTLEMEN.

HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

THAT'S MY FOOD. YOU GUYS DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING. BRING IT HERE.

IT'S MINE.

YOU COULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING.

COME ON.

BOY, HEY, YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT.

HEY, I DIDN'T ORDER A HAMBURGER, I ORDERED EGGS.

MARTIN, NOT THE WINDOW! NO!

[ GLASS BREAKS ]

[ ALL SCREAMS ]

S***!

[ SPLASHING ]

[ GUESTS SCREAMS ]

[ WOMAN SCREAMS ]

[ COUGHS ]

[ HITTING ]

SON OF A BITCH! WHERE IS IT?

SOMEBODY STOP THAT GUY! STOP HIM!

DON'T LEAVE ME! I CAN'T SWIM!

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME!

OKAY, OKAY.

COME ON WE'RE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE POOL.

NOW GET THE FUCK OFF MY BACK, OKAY?

CLEAR! MOVE IT! GET BACK! POLICE!

YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?

YEAH, I’M OK. WHERE WERE YOU, MAN? MY PARTNER. WHAT? WHY DIDN'T YOU FOLLOW ME DOWN?

- YEAH, WHY DIDN'T YOU FOLLOW IT DOWN? - SHUT UP, I WAS 7 FLOORS UP!

- HE HIT ME. - GOOD!

THIS GUY TOOK A BIG CHANCE TO POP ALL OF US. WHAT'D YOU WITNESS, A MURDER OR SOMETHING OR WHAT WAS IT?

NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT. HONEST.

ALL I DID WAS LAUNDER A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN DRUG MONEY.

HALF A BILLION DOLLARS?!

MORE OR LESS. WHO CAN COUNT THAT MUCH MONEY?

COULD I HAVE SOME COTTON BALLS FOR MY NOSE?

COULD YOU SHUT THE F*** UP?

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

SHUT UP!

MR. GETZ GOT AWAY. OUR BEST OPPORTUNITY AND HE GETS AWAY.

HE SLIPS THROUGH OUR FINGERS AND INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLICE.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

CHECKING TO SEE IF I WAS STANDING ON PLASTIC.

OKAY, I GOT IT.

I'M WHO I AM. YOU'RE A DRUG DEALER. I WORK IN A BANK.

YOU HAVE MONEY TO LAUNDER. WHAT DO YOU DO?

BRING IT TO YOU.

- HE DOES. - I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY ME?

WHO AM I?

YOU'RE A COURIER. YOU WORK FOR HIM.

I'M THE DRUG DEALER.

DON'T YOU HAVE PLATES? WHAT IS THIS?

I DEPOSIT THE CASH INTO THE ACCOUNT OF A DUMMY FINANCE COMPANY.

I ISSUE YOU A CASHIER'S CHECK...

...IN HIS NAME, MINUS A SMALL COMMISSION FOR MYSELF.

- THE OTHER END. - YOU LIKE BREATHING?

HOW MUCH?

2%.

NOT BAD, LEO. PRETTY PROSPEROUS.

YOU RETURN IT TO ME AS COLLATERAL ON A LOAN I MAKE TO YOU.

BUT YOU DON'T PAY BACK THE LOAN. YOU KEEP THE MONEY.

HOW'S THAT WORK?

THAT'S IT! DON'T YOU GET IT?

IT'S YOUR MONEY. YOU DON'T PAY IT BACK. AND IT'S CLEAN.

IT IS NOW LAUNDERED.

YOU COPS AREN'T TOO BRIGHT.

THIS IS THE BEST PART.

YOU TAKE A TAX DEDUCTION...

...ON INTEREST PAYMENTS YOU DON'T EVEN MAKE.

- AM I A GENIUS? - YOU'RE A SWINDLER.

CHEAT.

COME ON!

EVERYONE CHEATS. LOOK AT THE PENTAGON. SO YOU GOT IT?

SO HOW COME YOU TURNED YOURSELF IN, MR. BIG SHOT?

I WAS SCAMMING THOSE GUYS FOR MONTHS.

EVERY TRANSACTION, I KEPT A LITTLE.

YOU?

IT WAS EASY. CASH DEPOSITS...

...MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SMALL BILLS CHANGING HANDS.

WHO'S GOING TO MISS $10,000 HERE, $20,000 THERE?

DRUG DEALERS.

THAT'S RIGHT. THEY DID.

THAT'S WHY I'M LIVING OUT OF A SUITCASE NOW.

YOU CAN GIVE THAT TO NICK.

BUT IT'S SOFTER. I PUT A FABRIC SOFTENER IN THERE.

IT'S SMALL, LEROY.

IT'S LEO, NOT LEROY. I'LL BUY YOU ANOTHER SHIRT.

JUST GIVE ME THE NAMES OF THOSE DRUG DEALERS.

I DON'T KNOW ANY.

I JUST DEALT WITH THE COURIERS.

WHERE DOES TRISH KEEP MY LAUNDRY?

BEHIND THE MACHINE.

YOU NEVER MET ANYONE EXCEPT COURIERS?

NO NAMES.

WAIT A MINUTE, COME TO THINK OF IT! OKAY, LISTEN.

THEY TOOK ME UP IN THE HILLS TO A HOUSE ON STILTS.

AND I HAD A JOB INTERVIEW WITH A GUY...

...AND HIS NAME WAS...

HAYNES! HANS!

- TAKE US THERE. - WE HAVE TO SIT ON THIS GUY.

IT WON'T HURT TO LOOK.

I KNOW THE ADDRESS.

LET'S GO.

WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS!

COME ON, DON'T BE A KILLJOY!

WE'RE BACK! YOU'RE BLACK, I'M MAD.

THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT!

IF WE'RE GOING, SHOULDN'T I HAVE A GUN?

IS MY NOSE STILL BLEEDING? IT'S REALLY SORE.

SORRY ABOUT THAT.

IT SHOULD BE COMING UP SOON.

- 9856. - THAT'S IT.

- THAT'S ANOTHER POSSIBILITY. - THIS IS THE NINTH POSSIBILITY, LEO.

THAT'S IT. NINE. MY LUCKY NUMBER. NINE.

STAY IN THE CAR.

- CAN'T I COME? - STAY.

NICE CAR.

- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - HOOKING IT UP.

YOU'RE NOT BEING CAREFUL!

I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. IT'S A CAR...

...NOT A BABY CARRIAGE.

YOU'RE CHIPPING THE PAINT.

- YOU SMELL WHAT I SMELL? - I SMELL IT.

A RAT?

A REAL STINKY ONE.

WHERE YOU GOING?

I'M A PEEPING TOM. IT GOES WITH THE BADGE. IT'S FUN SOMETIMES.

BINGO!

LARS, LOOK!

WHAT THE F***?!

WHERE'S THE POOL?

NO POOL.

- OF COURSE THERE IS. - THIS HOUSE IS BUILT ON STILTS.

I'M SURE THERE'S A POOL.

CUFF YOURSELVES.

MOVE THAT TRUCK!

YOUR KEYS!

YOU ALL RIGHT?

WHERE YOU GOING?

THAT WAS THE WAITER FROM THE HOTEL.

WAIT FOR ME!

GET THE F*** OUT OF HERE!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU CAN'T TAKE MY TRUCK!

SERGEANT, IT'S THE GUY FROM THE HOTEL!

WHERE DID HE GO?

RIGGS IS HANGING ON THE TRUCK!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF THE CAR? GET IN THE CAR!

GET BACK! IT'S POLICE BUSINESS!

IT'S A HIGH-SPEED CHASE! GET OUT OF THE WAY!

I LOVE IT! WE GOT TO CATCH HIM!

HELLO, ASSHOLE.

GIVE ME THAT!

THERE THEY ARE! HURRY UP!

CAN'T YOU GO FASTER?!

WILL YOU SHUT THE F*** UP?

WIPE OUT. IT'S UNDER CONTROL.

I TOLD YOU TO LOOK OUT!

- YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR THIS. - SHUT UP! YAK-YAK-YAK.

AND STAY!

WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, A DOG?

HANDS BEHIND YOUR NECK!

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE? WE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

WHAT IS GOING ON?

FREEZE!

GET DOWN HERE!

COME ON, IT'S BEEN A BAD DAY.

SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.

TAKE IT EASY, OFFICER. I'M NOT ARMED.

I WON'T RESIST.

PUT DOWN YOUR GUNS, GENTLEMEN. IT'S ALL RIGHT. DO AS I SAY!

HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.

BEHIND YOUR HEAD!

YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

WE'RE PROFESSIONAL POLICE OFFICERS. WE DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

MY NAME IS ARJEN RUDD.

I'M MINISTER OF DIPLOMATIC AFFAIRS FOR THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSULATE.

SOUTH AFRICA. HOME OF THE KRUGERRAND.

AMONG OTHER THINGS.

THESE MEN ALSO WORK FOR THE CONSULATE.

WE HAVE DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIALS...

KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT OF THERE.

EVERYBODY, TAKE IT EASY. ESPECIALLY YOU, RIGGS.

RIGGS?

YOU'RE MARTIN RIGGS?

FROM CHICAGO. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? WHAT'S HIS NAME?

PIETER VON... VOR...

I'LL JUST CALL YOU ADOLF.

ARE YOU ARJEN RUDD? ARYAN...? THAT'S YOU.

IT'S OFFICIAL.

THEY ARE OFFICIAL.

UNDER THE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ACT...

...NO DIPLOMATIC AGENT MAY BE DETAINED OR ARRESTED...

...ONCE HIS IDENTITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.

WE HAVE A SERIOUS DIPLOMATIC SITUATION HERE...

...WHICH I WILL TAKE UP WITH YOUR STATE DEPARTMENT TOMORROW.

I'M QUAKING IN MY BOOTS, BUT I'LL STILL BRING YOU DOWN.

MY DEAR OFFICER...

...YOU COULD NOT EVEN GIVE ME A PARKING TICKET.

WHO IS THE DICKHEAD NOW, HUH?

THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT OWNS THIS HOUSE. THIS IS SOUTH AFRICAN SOIL.

NOW GET OUT OF HERE.

ALL OF YOU.

DON'T DO IT.

DON'T DO IT OR I'LL MAKE YOU EAT THIS F***ING THING.

KAFFIR.

COULD YOU STEP OUT OF THE CAR, PLEASE?

PUT THEM AWAY. I'M SORRY.

SORRY. ARE YOU OKAY?

DON'T OPEN THAT.

THAT IS A DIPLOMATIC POUCH...

...PROTECTED UNDER ARTICLE 27 OF THE VIENNA CONVENTION.

IS HE SERIOUS WITH THIS STUFF?

THESE ARE POLICE OFFICERS, MISS VAN DEN HAAS. THEY WERE JUST LEAVING.

SHE IS A CONSULATE SECRETARY.

GIVE HER BACK THE BRIEFCASE.

GIVE IT TO HER.

I'M SORRY, MISS CONSULATE SECRETARY.

DON'T TALK TO THEM! COME HERE.

HE'S A NICE GUY. WHAT'S HE PAYING YOU AN HOUR?

WANT TO INCREASE YOUR PAY? BETTER HOURS?

I'D START GETTING USED TO THAT SORT OF VIEW.

IT'S THE TRIANGLE TRADE AGAIN.

DON'T YOU KNOW AMERICAN HISTORY? MOLASSES TO RUM TO SLAVES.

NOW DRUGS TO DOLLARS TO KRUGERRANDS.

I GOT A DEAD GUY WITH A SURFBOARD WHERE HIS FACE USED TO BE...

...AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT BREATHING DOWN OUR THROATS.

I'LL HAVE TO MAKE A FORMAL APOLOGY TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSULATE.

APOLOGIZE? HE'S A SACK OF S***! HE'S A CROOK.

IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE'S A DIPLOMAT.

HE HAS IMMUNITY. WE CAN'T TOUCH HIM, ARREST HIM, PROSECUTE HIM.

- DOES THAT SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU? - YES, SIR.

- WHO THE HELL IS THIS GUY? - LEO GETZ. NICE TO MEET YOU.

YOU TOOK A CIVILIAN ON A BUST. ONE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING!

HE'S ALIVE, ISN'T HE?

I SIGNED A WAIVER. BESIDES, I USUALLY WAIT IN THE CAR.

USUALLY?

THEY'RE VERY ADAMANT ABOUT THAT.

- I DON'T GIVE A F***. - THEY'RE GOOD COPS!

THEY'RE THE BEST. ONE TIME, A GUY WAS WAIVING A GUN...!

WHAT DID HE SAY?

WHAT DID HE SAY?

- "I DON'T GIVE A F***. " - WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

IT'S HIS MANTRA. WHY IS EVERYONE PARKED ON MY DESK? UP!

IT'S A RUBBER PLANT!

IT LOOKS TO BE ABOUT A WEEK'S SUPPLY.

GO SPIT.

I FORGOT. YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR THAT S***.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU CAN EXCHANGE IT.

ONE MOMENT, MISS VAN DEN HAAS.

I HOPE YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAPPENED HERE TODAY.

I'D RATHER NOT JUMP TO ANY WRONG CONCLUSIONS.

WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME?

THE POLICIES OF OUR GOVERNMENT ARE NOT POPULAR HERE IN AMERICA.

THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HERE IS OVERRUN WITH BLACKS.

THEY HAVE BADGES AND GUNS AND THEY HATE US.

OUR CONSULATE, ITS STAFF...

...AND PARTICULARLY MYSELF WILL ALWAYS BE TARGETS FOR THEIR HARASSMENT.

THINGS ARE GETTING OUT OF HAND.

THERE ARE TOO MANY LOSSES. WE'LL MOVE THE CASH IN ONE LARGE SHIPMENT.

WE'LL NEED MORE THAN A SUITCASE.

I'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT. YOU WORRY ABOUT THE POLICE.

YOUR WARNING DID NOT WORK.

- LET'S GO, LEO! - I'M COMING.

COME ON! MOVE!

OKAY! HEY, THEY'RE COPS, OKAY?

I'VE GOT TO EAT, TOO.

GIVE ME THE FOOD.

WHO ORDERED THE SUPER COMBO?

I GET A STEAK SANDWICH.

WHO GETS LEO?

YOU GOT A BIG EMPTY HOUSE. I GOT A TRAILER. WHAT WILL I DO WITH HIM?

MY PLACE IS TOO SMALL. YOU TAKE HIM.

I HAD HIM LAST NIGHT.

EXCUSE ME, FELLOWS.

THIS IS TUNA. I HATE TUNA.

I REFUSE TO GET STUCK WITH TUNA.

- DON'T EAT THE TUNA. - I JUST SAID THAT!

I'M NOT EATING TUNA. LET'S GO BACK.

WE'RE NOT GOING BACK! SHUT UP!

SURE, DON'T GO BACK. OKAY, DON'T GO BACK!

LET ME GIVE YOU A FRIENDLY PIECE OF ADVICE.

NEVER GO THROUGH THE DRIVE-THROUGH. ALWAYS WALK UP TO THE COUNTER.

LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

THEY F*** YOU AT THE DRIVE-THROUGH!

THEY KNOW YOU'LL BE MILES AWAY BEFORE YOU FIND OUT YOU GOT F***ED.

YOU WON'T TURN AROUND AND COME BACK.

SO WHO GETS F***ED? LEO GETZ.

I'M NOT EATING THIS TUNA!

SHUT UP!

GET RID OF THAT MAN.

YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE THE PREMISES RIGHT NOW.

THE MORNING FAXES.

WHAT'S THE MATTER? HE KICK YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE?

I WANT YOU TO BITE LEO FOR ME.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I'M CLEANING UP THIS PIGSTY.

I LIKE THIS PIGSTY.

WHEN DID YOU LAST DO THE REFRIGERATOR? OR THE PAN UNDER IT?

THERE'S A PAN UNDER THERE?

WHERE'S MY PHONE?

WHERE'S MY TV? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

EVERYTHING IS OUTSIDE.

JUST STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

- GET THE DOG OUT OF HERE! - YOU GO BEFORE THE MUTT.

OUT, OUT! OH, MAN.

IT'S COLLINS.

HAS MURTAUGH CHECKED IN WITH YOU?

NO. WHY?

I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM. HE DOESN'T ANSWER HIS PHONE.

I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

STAY IN THE CAR.

I'M UPSTAIRS!

SHOULD I CALL 999, OFFICER IN DISTRESS?

I'LL COVER THE BACK!

- WHERE ARE YOU? - I'M UP HERE.

IN HERE.

GOOD MORNING.

FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS...

...I GET THE BATHROOM TO MYSELF.

NO KIDS BANGING ON THE DOOR. NO WIFE ASKING ME TO HURRY UP.

JUST ME AND MY NEW SALTWATER SPORTSMAN MAGAZINE!

THE ONE WITH THE ARTICLE ON DEEP-SEA FISHING?

SO I'M READING ABOUT MARLIN FISHING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO...

...WHEN I GLANCED OVER.

OH, JESUS.

IS THAT ALL?

YOU SCARED THE S*** OUT OF ME.

SCARED THE S*** OUT OF YOU?

HOW LONG YOU BEEN HERE?

I'VE BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT.

MY LEGS ARE SO NUMB I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN...

DON'T MOVE.

I CAN'T.

JUST STAY THAT WAY. DO YOU MIND?

IT'S A DIRTY JOB, BUT SOMEONE'S GOT TO DO IT.

TELL ME I'M NOT F***ED.

HE'S F***ED.

OKAY, BUT I'D BE LYING.

YOU'LL BE OKAY IF YOU DON'T STAND UP.

THAT'S A RELIEF.

- I HAVE TO GET HELP. - NO WAY!

WHY?

I'M ON THE TOILET. GIVE ME A BREAK.

THIS IS SERIOUS. I GOT TO GET THE BOMB SQUAD HERE.

BOMB SQUAD?

OKAY, CALL THEM IN.

DON'T USE THE OPEN FREQUENCY.

LET'S TRY TO KEEP THIS QUIET, OKAY?

SURE. TRUST ME.

AN ESCORT IS REALLY NOT NECESSARY.

I KNOW YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST, BUT IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT.

I HAVE HELPED POLICEMEN THROUGH VERY TRAUMATIC MOMENTS.

THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS ROOM THAT I CANNOT HANDLE.

I WAS WRONG.

EXCUSE ME.

I SHOULD'VE KNOWN, WHERE THERE'S ONE, THERE'S THE OTHER.

YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST? I HAVE THESE DREAMS.

IT'S READY TO COME OUT.

I GOT TO LIVE IN THIS HOUSE!

CLEAR THIS ROOM.

COME ON, RIGGS.

YOU, TOO, RIGGS.

NO.

RIGGS, OUT.

ALL RIGHT.

DIVE INTO THE TUB.

THEN PULL THE BOMB BLANKET OVER YOUR HEAD.

THIS CAST IRON TUB WILL WITHSTAND A HELL OF A BLAST.

I CAN'T.

HE CAN'T. HE'S BEEN ON THERE FOR 18 HOURS.

HE CAN'T EVEN WALK.

I'M GONNA HAVE TO HELP HIM.

ALL RIGHT, YOU BETTER WEAR THIS.

THE NITROGEN?

ALMOST THERE.

HE'S SPRAYING THIS THING WITH LIQUID NITROGEN...

...TO GIVE YOU 1 OR 2 SECONDS BEFORE DETONATION.

- GOT THAT? - 2 SECONDS. THANKS A LOT.

LIGHTS OUT.

GET HIM UP AND OUT.

GOOD LUCK.

YOU GOT A PIECE?

- YEAH, A SMITH AND WESSON. - TRY THIS ONE.

SAFETY'S ON. I'LL COLLECT IT LATER.

GOOD LUCK.

ALONE AT LAST.

WHY DIDN'T THEY PLANT THE BOMB IN TRISH'S STOVE?

ALL THE NEEDLESS SUFFERING COULD HAVE ENDED THERE.

I'M GOING TO DIE ON A TOILET.

GUYS LIKE YOU DON'T DIE ON TOILETS.

AND I'M HERE AND I DON'T PLAN ON GOING NOW.

LET'S DO IT.

ON THREE. WAIT, LET ME GET INTO THE TUB.

I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU...

ON THREE, HUH? WHAT DO YOU SAY?

ONE...

...TWO...

WAIT.

DO WE DO IT ON THREE, OR...

...ONE, TWO, THREE...

- ... THEN DO IT? - IT'S YOUR ASS. IT'S UP TO YOU.

MY ASS, YEAH.

THREE.

WE GO ON THREE?

ONE, TWO AND THEN THREE!

ONE...

MARTIN?

I KNOW.

I MEAN IT, MAN.

I HEAR YOU.

WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIE, ALL RIGHT?

ON THREE.

GET OFF ME. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO SEE US LIKE THIS.

MR. JONES?

SIT DOWN.

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY?

I HAVE THIS PROBLEM, THIS VERY DELICATE MATTER.

MY FRIEND WANTS TO EMIGRATE TO SOUTH AFRICA.

OF COURSE, I CAN HELP HIM DO THAT.

I WANT YOU TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

TALK HIM OUT OF IT?

WHATEVER FOR?

THIS IS A BAD TIME FOR HIM TO GO, WITH ALL THE TROUBLE.

HAVE HIM COME BACK LATER IN THE WEEK AND WE'LL SIT DOWN...

HE'S HERE.

YEAH, HE'S HERE NOW. ALPHONSE?

THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE.

SAY, WHAT?

LISTEN TO YOUR FRIEND. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO GO TO SOUTH AFRICA.

WHY NOT?

BECAUSE YOU'RE BLACK.

YOU ARE.

HE IS.

OF COURSE I AM BLACK. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GO.

TO JOIN MY BROTHERS IN THE STRUGGLE...

...AGAINST THE RACIST...

...FASCIST...

...WHITE MINORITY REGIME!

FASCIST REGIME!

ONE MAN, ONE VOTE!

FREE SOUTH AFRICA, YOU SON-OF-A-B***H!

I'VE HEARD AS MUCH AS I WANT TO. YOU MUST LEAVE.

WHAT'S HAPPENING? DON'T TOUCH ME! BACK OFF!

CLOSE THE SECURITY GATE! QUICKLY!

END APARTHEID NOW!

YOU GOING TO ARREST ME IF I DON'T SHUT UP?

ONE MAN, ONE VOTE! FREE SOUTH AFRICA! GIVE ME THAT FLAG!

YOU CAN'T PUSH ME OUT!

YOU CALL THIS SECURITY?

MORE PEOPLE COME IN AND OUT OF HERE THAN GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

WAIT, GENTLEMEN!

DON'T BOTHER TO CALL THE POLICE. I'M HERE ALREADY.

I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

WELL, WELL.

THE MASTER RACE.

I HOPE YOU REALIZE THE TROUBLE YOU ARE IN RIGHT NOW.

AS USUAL, YOU PEOPLE HAVE EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN AND TURNED AROUND.

GENTLEMEN...

...SHOW OFFICER RIGGS INTO THE STREET.

FINGERS OFF.

HANDS OFF!

LET ME SEE THAT.

THAT'S A PIECE OF HARDWARE YOU GOT. WHERE DO YOU GET THAT STUFF?

I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. WHERE'S IT FROM, SOUTH AFRICA?

DON'T MOVE.

YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT ME? I GOT A BAD REPUTATION. SOMETIMES I GO NUTS.

DON'T MOVE.

I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU, ARJEN. OR IS IT ARYAN?

WHATEVER THE F*** YOUR NAME IS.

YOU FOLD UP YOUR TENTS...

...AND GET OUT OF MY COUNTRY...

...AND I WON'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU.

I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

'CAUSE IF YOU STICK AROUND HERE, I'M GONNA F*** YOUR ASS.

SEND YOU HOME WITH YOUR BALLS IN A SLING.

JUST GET OUT OF HERE...

...KAFFIR LOVER.

EENIE...

...MEENIE...

...MINEY...

HEY, MOE!

SORRY, ADOLF.

PICK THEM UP WITH YOUR HANDS.

BIG SMILE. BIG SMILE!

VORSTEDT, COME HERE.

VORSTEDT!

- HELLO, OFFICER...? - MARTIN RIGGS.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I'VE BEEN WITH YOUR BOSS... SHOOTING THE BREEZE.

SHOOTING HIS FISH.

THE GUY GOES, "BUT, BUT, BUT... YOU'RE BLACK!"

HE'S BLACK.

NO S***.

HE STARTED SOME S***!

YOU GET INTO RUDD'S OFFICE?

I GOT UP THERE.

ARYAN CRUD AND HIS BROWN SHIRTS TURNED UP, BUT I RIPPED THIS OFF A PAD.

"ALBA VARDEN, THURSDAY. " ALBA VARDEN?

ISN'T THAT HITLER'S GIRLFRIEND?

THAT'S EVA BRAUN.

HE HAS A DATE WITH HER THURSDAY.

HER NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

I DON'T KNOW HER. IT JUST SOUNDS FAMILIAR. ALBA VARDEN.

A DELI! LET'S EAT. I'M STARVING.

I'LL SPRING.

LET'S GO. SOUNDS GOOD.

- GET OUT THE OTHER SIDE, LEO. - IT'S OKAY!

NO CARS.

THAT POLICEMAN.

YOU SHOULD PICK FROM THE BOTTOM.

THEY PUT THE OLD STUFF ON TOP.

OFFICER RIGGS!

I FOLLOWED YOU FROM THE CONSULATE.

YOU FOLLOWED ME?

WELL, I NEEDED SOME PORK CHOPS AND A TOILET BRUSH, TOO.

I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE...

...FOR THE OTHER DAY, IF WE FRIGHTENED YOU.

I WAS A BIT STARTLED BY ALL THOSE GUNS.

I'M SORRY. AND I WANTED TO THANK YOU, TOO.

THANK ME FOR WHAT?

YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR BOSS VERY MUCH, DO YOU?

I DON'T LIKE MANY THINGS ABOUT MY BOSS AND MY COUNTRY.

BUT I LIKE MY JOB VERY MUCH.

IT KEEPS ME HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

YOU LIKE THIS TOWN?

THAT'S A NEW ONE.

- I FORGOT YOUR FIRST NAME. - IT'S RIKA.

RIKA VAN HAAGEN-DAZS.

- ICE CREAM? - NO, VAN DEN HAAS. IT'S DUTCH.

THAT'S REAL PRETTY.

YOU GOT A RABBIT AT HOME?

IT'S MINE.

SHOP ONE DAY AT A TIME?

GOOD POLICE WORK, OFFICER.

I GET PAID FOR THAT.

I DON'T SHOP FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK.

WHY NOT?

I NEVER KNOW WHAT I'LL BE HUNGRY FOR.

WAIT. HAVE DINNER WITH ME.

I GOT A NICE PLACE ON THE BEACH. A GOOD VIEW FROM EVERY WINDOW.

A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET. COME ON, BE ORIGINAL. EVERYONE ELSE SAYS NO.

COME TO MY PLACE. I'M A GOURMET COOK.

LET GO OF THE BASKET.

I'LL SCREAM.

I'LL EMBARRASS YOU IN PUBLIC. YOU'LL TURN RED LIKE THAT APPLE.

- COME ON WITH ME. - NO, NO, PLEASE.

LET GO OF MY BAG! LOOK WHAT SHE'S DOING! SOMEBODY CALL A COP!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

LET'S GO BEFORE SOMEONE CALLS A COP.

YOU ARE A COP.

YOU MUST BE AN HONEST COP.

IT AIN'T MUCH, BUT IT'S EVERYTHING I SAID. LOOK AT THE VIEW.

I DID EXAGGERATE ABOUT ONE THING, THOUGH.

I'M NOT EXACTLY A GOURMET COOK. I CAN ONLY MAKE CHILI.

- LIKE IT WITH CRUSHED OREOS? - OF COURSE.

A WOMAN AFTER MY OWN HEART.

WATCH YOUR STEP.

SAM WANTS IN.

HERE, SIT DOWN. OH, WAIT A MINUTE. A LITTLE FILTHY.

I HAVE NO WINE. HOW ABOUT A BEER?

THAT'S FINE.

SHE DRINKS BEER.

WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU GOT A DIRTY GLASS?

OH, IT'S THE WEDDING RING.

I USED TO BE MARRIED.

NOT ANY MORE?

NOT ANY MORE.

I'VE GOT SOMETHING ON THE STOVE.

RUDD'S HIDING BEHIND HIS DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIALS, ISN'T HE?

RUDD'S HIDING BEHIND HIS DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIALS.

HE'S NOT A VERY NICE GUY.

WHATEVER HE'S DOING...

...HE SHOULDN'T GET AWAY WITH IT.

HOW'S IT HANGING, WYLER?

- WHAT DO YOU WANT? - I HOPE BETTER THAN MURTAUGH.

EASY, EASY.

TELL ME SOMETHING. HAVE YOUR BRAINS EVER SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY?

WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT? I'M A COP!

NO, YOU WERE A COP.

HURRY UP, HONEY.

I'M GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE LAPS BEFORE I GO TO THE STATION.

SAM, TAKE A HIKE. NO STOOGES TONIGHT. GO ON.

GET THAT BEER IN HERE.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

CAVANAUGH, ARE YOU IN OR OUT?

I'M OUT.

PUT SOME MUSIC ON.

WHO'S NOT ACCOUNTED FOR?

RIGGS AND MURTAUGH.

MURTAUGH'S TAKING THE WITNESS TO A NEW LOCATION.

- AND RIGGS? - HASN'T CHECKED IN YET.

GET ON THE RADIO AND FIND THEM!

WE LOST WYLER, COLLINS, CAVANAUGH. HOW MANY DO WE HAVE TO LOSE?

LET'S WORRY ABOUT THE ONES THAT ARE ALIVE, ALL RIGHT? DO IT.

SORRY, CAPTAIN.

GET ME RIGGS.

I'LL GET THAT.

WRONG NUMBER.

THANKS TO YOU, I MISSED MY POKER GAME AND I WAS FEELING REAL LUCKY.

OKAY, SO WHAT I SEE ARE NICE, CONSERVATIVE TAX RETURNS.

EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK, BLACK AND WHITE.

SO YOU JUST NEED TO PLAY AROUND IN THE GRAY AREAS...

...IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME BUCKS.

ON YOUR SALARY, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO BUT YOU NEED DEDUCTIONS.

- MY BOAT. - YOU CAN'T DEDUCT IT.

NO, IT'S THE BILL OF SALE.

I KNOW, BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT.

THAT'S IT, MY BOAT! LET'S GO!

TO MY HOUSE.

BECAUSE OF MY BOAT.

LOOK AT THIS COMMERCIAL.

LOOK AT THE BODY ON THIS KID. SHE IS SO HOT.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I WANT TO LOOK AT THE GIRL! WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

I DIDN'T HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

SAY WHAT? SHE'S GREAT.

SHE MAKES ME WANT TO BUY RUBBERS.

TIME FOR THE SEVENTH INNING STRETCH.

THAT'S A BASEBALL EXPRESSION.

I KNOW.

BUT WE'RE ONLY UP TO THE FOURTH INNING.

BATTER UP.

STAY IN THE CAR.

I'LL ONLY BE A MINUTE, OKAY?

STAY IN THE CAR? IT'S COLD. YOU HAVE NO DOOR.

YOU'RE THE REASON THERE'S NO DOOR. TURN ON THE HEAT.

DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING. NOTHING. I MEAN NOTHING!

ALBA VARDEN. WHY DO I KNOW THE NAME?

IT'S HERE. IT'S GOT TO BE.

- ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER HOBBY. - YEAH, ANOTHER HOBBY. WHAT'S NEW?

THAT'S THE DAY ON MY BOAT.

IT'S NOT THERE. WHERE IS IT?

MY BIRTHDAY.

I'LL BE DAMNED.

ALBA VARDEN IS A SHIP, NOT A WOMAN.

LEO, I TOLD YOU TO STAY IN THE CAR!

S***!

NAILED THEM BOTH.

MY CAR!

LEO!

GET UP, GET DRESSED. GET DRESSED. COME ON.

- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. - JUST TRUST ME. I GOT A BAD FEELING.

GET IN THE TRUCK. THE KEYS ARE UNDER THE FRONT SEAT.

WHEN THEY STOP TO RELOAD, RUN FOR THE TRUCK!

- WHAT ABOUT YOU? - I'LL BE OKAY.

I'LL MEET YOU IN THE TRUCK. GO ON! STAY OUT OF THE LIGHT!

THE MASTER RACE.

YOU S***! WHO WERE THOSE PEOPLE?

YOU TELL ME. WAS IT YOUR HUSBAND? WHAT ARE YOU DOING SATURDAY?

IT'S SAM!

HEAD DOWN!

COME ON, SAM!

COME ON, SAM.

SHAKE A LEG.

YOU MADE IT.

HAS HE GOT ANY HOLES IN HIM?

OH, YOU CLEVER DOG.

I PROMISED TO HAVE YOU HOME BY 11.

THIS IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE FIRST DATE I'VE EVER BEEN ON.

WAIT UNTIL THE SECOND ONE.

- NO MORE HELICOPTERS, PLEASE. - OKAY, I PROMISE.

THIS IS A VERY NICE BUILDING.

ANY VACANCIES? I'M BETWEEN HOMES.

YOU CAN STAY RIGHT HERE.

I CAN?

YES, THERE'S A VACANT APARTMENT UP THERE.

I'M KIDDING.

YOU CAN STAY WITH ME.

TONIGHT?

YES, TONIGHT. AND TOMORROW NIGHT. AND THE NIGHT AFTER THAT.

AND AFTER THAT?

DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK.

I BETTER GO.

GO INSIDE AND LOCK ALL THE DOORS AND STAY THERE.

AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WORK TOMORROW.

THERE'S BETTER WAYS OF STAYING IN LA THAN WORKING THERE.

ALL RIGHT. I'VE JUST QUIT.

I'LL JUST GRAB A FEW THINGS... HELL, I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING.

JUST BRING YOURSELF.

I BETTER GO.

GO HOME!

GO GET THE GIRL.

I WOULD OFFER YOU A DRINK, BUT I UNDERSTAND...

...YOU'RE ON THE WAGON.

THAT STUFF WILL KILL YOU QUICK.

YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT ME, WHO ARE YOU?

I CHANGED THE COURSE OF YOUR LIFE.

FOUR YEARS AGO...

...WHEN YOU WAS A NARC AT LONG BEACH...

...YOU WERE GETTING TOO CLOSE, SO WE PUT A CONTRACT OUT ON YOU.

I HANDLED IT MYSELF.

DROVE YOUR CAR RIGHT OFF THE ROAD, REMEMBER?

BUT YOU WEREN'T DRIVING, WERE YOU?

YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THE SURPRISE...

...WHEN I PULLED BACK A MATTED MOP OF BLOODY HAIR TO SEE THIS WOMAN'S FACE.

YOUR WIFE, RIGHT?

SHE DIDN'T DIE STRAIGHT AWAY.

IT TOOK A BIT OF TIME.

YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH LUCK WITH WOMEN, DO YOU?

SHE'S DEAD. THEY KILLED HER.

WHERE ARE YOU?

THEY KILLED HER. SHE'S DEAD. THEY KILLED THEM BOTH.

SLOW DOWN. WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHERE ARE YOU?

SHE'S DEAD, ROGER.

CALM DOWN. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. WHERE ARE YOU?

I'M NOT A COP TONIGHT. IT'S PERSONAL.

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT. THERE'S MORE.

I'M GOING TO GET THOSE BASTARDS. I'M GOING TO F*** THEM. I'M GOING NOW.

WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE STILT HOUSE! WE'RE UNDER ORDERS!

THEN THE HOUSE WILL HAVE TO COME TO ME.

THEY KILLED THEM BOTH.

THEY GOT RIKA AND THEY GOT MY WIFE.

S***.

WHAT'S THE DEAL?

YOU TALK TO THE FEDS, BUT YOU DON'T TALK TO ME.

THAT'S NOT FAIR.

WE TRUSTED YOU.

YOU BETRAYED US.

YOU TOOK OUR MONEY!

WE WANT IT BACK NOW...

...YOU SLIMY LITTLE S***.

GIVE HIM MORE. HE LIKES IT.

DON'T TRY AND STOP ME.

I'VE SEEN THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYES BEFORE.

THEY DECLARED WAR ON THE POLICE.

YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

I HEARD IT ON THE RADIO.

WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY.

CAVANAUGH...

...WYLER, SHAPIRO...

...RIKA, VICKI. HOW MUCH F***ING AUTHORITY DO YOU NEED?

YOU GOT A PLAN?

DRIVE AROUND THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE...

...WAIT FOR MY SIGNAL...

...AND THEN JUST GO IN AND SHOOT THOSE F***ERS.

THEY GOT LEO.

BE CAREFUL.

WAIT.

WHAT'S YOUR SIGNAL?

YOU'LL KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS.

SOMEHOW I THINK I WILL KNOW.

FEEL LIKE TALKING?

IT'S THE BIG ONE!

COOL IT. WATCH HIM.

MOVE ME AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS!

RIGGS, YOU CRAZY MOTHER...!

HOLY CHRIST!

- YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH, I'M OKAY.

THANKS.

- WAS ADOLF IN THERE? - HE GOT AWAY.

- I'M GOING TO FIND HIM. - WHAT ABOUT LEO?

WHAT ABOUT LEO?

YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

TAKE MY CAR TO THE POLICE STATION AND WAIT FOR THE FEDERAL MARSHAL.

IT'S BEEN AN EXPERIENCE KNOWING YOU.

- I DON'T WANT A HUG. - GO ON. LUCKY IF YOU SEE HIM AGAIN.

I HAD A LOT OF FUN.

YOU DO YOUR DUTY NOW.

I'M GOING TO REALLY GET THEM NOW.

LISTEN. WAIT.

IS IT OKAY IF I SOUND THE SIREN?

LOUD AS YOU WANT.

REALLY? OKAY. REALLY?

CHECK IT OUT.

ALBA VARDEN IS A CARGO SHIP, NOT A WOMAN.

THE PORT AUTHORITY SAID THAT THE ALBA VARDEN ARRIVED TODAY...

...AND HEADS OUT TOMORROW TO SOUTH AFRICA.

THIS IS THE ELEVENTH DOCK.

IT MUST BE HERE SOMEPLACE. I KNOW I'M RIGHT.

THE SHIP!

WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

THAT CONTAINER THERE WITH THREE HEAVY HITTERS.

LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

I'LL TAKE 2 OF THEM OUT, YOU TAKE 1.

BETTER YET, YOU TAKE 2, I TAKE 1. PULL OVER TO THE SIDE.

- I CAN'T SEE S***! - ME, EITHER. WHAT IS THIS S***?

GOT A LIGHT?

IT'S RUDD'S, WHATEVER IT IS.

I STILL CAN'T SEE S***.

- YOU GOT SOMETHING? - I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A CAR.

S***! FORT KNOX!

HELL, HOW MUCH IS IT?

THOUSANDS.

F***ING MILLIONS.

BILLIONS OF F***ING DONALD TRUMP LOTTO.

LOOK AT THIS.

THESE ARE $1,000 BILLS!

WITH WHAT I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND I COULD PUT ALL MY KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE.

TAKE IT.

F**ING DRUG MONEY.

DO SOMETHING GOOD WITH IT.

RUDD WON'T NEED IT WHERE HE'S GOING.

LOAD THE CONTAINER.

THE NEXT TIME THE SUN HITS THEIR BODIES, THEY'LL BE IN CAPE TOWN.

- HEY, THIS THING'S MOVING. - IT SURE AS HELL IS.

- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW? - I DON'T KNOW.

LET'S SHOOT OUR WAY OUT.

NO, DON'T. I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

OUR MONEY.

MAKE SURE THEY'RE DEAD.

- YOU GO FIRST. I'M TOO OLD. - YOU GO FIRST. I'LL COVER YOU.

- HOW DO WE GET OUT OF HERE? - I'LL GO THIS WAY.

I'LL GO THIS WAY AND CHECK OVER HERE.

OH, S***!

RIGGS, YOU OKAY?

DROP IT, ASSHOLE!

DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!

IT'S JUST BEEN REVOKED.

YOU'RE BREATHING. YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

NO, DON'T DIE.

YOU'RE NOT DEAD UNTIL I TELL YOU.

YOU GOT THAT, RIGGS? YOU'RE NOT DEAD UNTIL I TELL YOU.

YOU GOT THAT?

YOU' RE NOT DEAD UNTIL I TELL YOU.

NOW, BREATHE WITH ME.

BREATHE.

ROG, IN MY POCKET.

I WANT YOU TO THROW THOSE THINGS AWAY. THOSE THINGS WILL KILL YOU.

YOU SON-OF-A-B***H.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE DYING.

I DIDN'T DIE ON YOUR TOILET, I'M NOT GOING TO DIE IN YOUR ARMS.

YOU SON-OF-A-B***H.

WHERE ARE THEY? ARE THEY ALL GONE? DID YOU GET THE BAD GUYS?

THEY BEEN DEKAFFIRNATED.

DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH! JESUS!

DID ANYONE EVER TELL YOU...

...YOU REALLY ARE A BEAUTIFUL MAN?

GIVE US A KISS.

WHERE'D THAT BULLET HIT YOU?

WE COULD DRIVE IT OUT.
FINE, IT'S YOUR TURN TO DRIVE.
NO KEYS. I COULD HOT-WIRE IT.
DON'T EVEN SAY "HOT-WIRE"

YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHY AM I DOING THIS? WHY?
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
ROGER: WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
- I'M THINKING WE SHOULD CUT THE BLUE WIRE.
- WAIT!
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I THINK.
- YOU THINK MAYBE THE RED?
NO! NO!
I'M THINKING IT'S 8 MINUTES AND 42 SECONDS.
WE CAN GO UPSTAIRS, WAIT FOR
THE BOMB SQUAD, AND HAVE A CAPPUCCINO.
THE BOMB SQUAD NEVER GETS HERE ON TIME.
AND IT'S 8 MINUTES, 31 SECONDS.
ROG, PLEASE.
FORGET THE CAPPUCCINO.

BUT THEN THEY'LL SAY: "LET'S CUT
THE BLUE WIRE," WHICH I'LL DO RIGHT NOW.
- WAIT, WAIT!
- WHAT?
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?
IT'S JUST A HUNCH.
A HUNCH?
REMEMBER THE BOMB UNDER YOUR TOILET?
- HOW COULD I FORGET?
- RED WIRE, BLUE WIRE, SAME THING.
THIS IS MORE SIMPLIFIED,
BUT A BIT MORE POWERFUL.
FROM WHERE I SAT, I COULDN'T SEE.
FORGET IT. COME ON, TRUST ME.
TRUST YOU?
GUESS NOT. I'M CUTTING THE RED WIRE, OKAY?

I SAID, DON'T HIT HIM!
RIGGS: IS SHE FIRED?
DIRECTOR: YES, SHE'S FIRED!
RIGGS: IS SHE FIRED?
DIRECTOR: NO, NO.
ROGER: IT'S OKAY.
RIGGS: DOES SHE GET A RAISE?
DIRECTOR: YES! I SAID, "YES"!
RIGGS: GOOD.
RIGGS: RIANNE, I THINK YOU HAVE
A NEW FRIEND HERE.
WE'D LIKE YOU TO COME BACK.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS FROM CREW]
ROGER: YOU CAN'T SETTLE EVERY PROBLEM
WITH YOUR FISTS.
- I COULDN'T USE MY GUN WITH THAT CROWD.
- SIX MORE DAYS.
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.
DID RIANNE GET HER JOB BACK?
DID SHE GET A RAISE?
I DON'T HEAR A "THANK YOU."
MAYBE I SHOULD BECOME A HOLLYWOOD AGENT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ROGER: IT WON'T WORK.
RIGGS: WHY?
ROGER: YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KILLER INSTINCT.
RIGGS: SON OF A BITCH!
- WE SHOULD'VE PUT A BAG ON THE METER.
- I'LL PUT IT IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.
OH, YEAH? GOOD MAN.
IT'S FULL. PUT IT IN THE BACK SEAT.
- YOU REALLY LIKE THOSE THINGS?
- THESE? THEY'RE GOOD.
[ROGER CHUCKLES]
YOU CAN EAT A BOX OF THEM
AND STILL BE DYING FOR A CIGARETTE.
[ROGER CHUCKLES]
- DID YOU CUT YOURSELF SHAVING?
- YEAH.
RIGGS: OLD RAZOR?
OLD FACE.
YOU'RE LETTING THIS RETIREMENT THING
GET YOU DOWN.
SPEND A FEW MORE YEARS
TO GET USED TO THE IDEA. WHY QUIT?
- I'VE GOT PLANS FOR MY RETIREMENT.
- OH, YEAH, PLANS.
- I DO. BIG PLANS.
- BIG PLANS?
- I'VE HAD THEM FOR A LONG TIME.
- LIKE WHAT?
LIKE...
- THINGS, MAN!
- THINGS!
THINGS!
THINGS THAT I'VE PUT OFF.
OH, THOSE THINGS. I'VE GOT THOSE, TOO.
I SEE YOU'VE GIVEN THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT.
[ROGER SIGHS]
YEAH.
I'VE GIVEN IT A LOT OF THOUGHT.
[GUNSHOT]
[DEEP SIGH]
RIGGS: [YELLS] GODDAMN IT!
COP: WHAT'S GOING ON?
RIGGS: I'M PISSED OFF. YOU NEED A REASON?
COP: I THOUGHT I HEARD GUNFIRE.
RIGGS: GET YOUR HEARING CHECKED!
PUT THAT AWAY!
WHAT'RE YOU LOOKING AT?
HEY, MAN. PEACE.
[THUNDEROUS GUN BLASTS]
COP 1: WHY'D YOU CALL US DOWN HERE?
RIGGS: HOW'RE YOU DOING, SON?
RIGGS: DOES YOUR MOTHER
KNOW YOU'RE HERE?
RIGGS: DID YOU DO THIS?
COP 2: NICE SHOOTING.
BETTER THAN BILLY THE KID.
DIAPER RASH MAKES YOU CRANKY.
GIVE IT TO YOUR MOM.
MAYBE SHE'LL STICK IT ON THE REFRIGERATOR.
- CAN I BORROW YOUR GLASSES?
- YEAH.
RIGGS: WHO'S WEARING?
ROGER, YOU ARE.
WHY ME? YOU GUYS SHOULD BE WEARING.
SQUAD MEMBER:
MR. MURTAUGH, LET ME ASSIST YOU.
I DON'T NEED HELP.
I'VE BEEN DRESSING MYSELF SINCE I WAS 30.
- OKAY, MAN, JUST TRYING TO HELP.
- GET BACK.
ALL YOU PERVERTS, TURN YOUR HEADS.
COP 3: TAKE IT OFF, BABY!
ROGER: HOLD THIS SHIRT.
SQUAD MEMBER: YOU'RE WEARING A GIRDLE!
- HE'S GOT A GIRDLE!
- THIS IS NOT A GIRDLE.
ROGER: THIS IS NOT A GIRDLE. IT'S MY BACK!
MY BACK WENT OUT ON ME.
I HURT MY BACK THIS MORNING LIFTING WEIGHTS.
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
RIGGS: I SAW HIM DO IT.
EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.
I WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT
THESE... IOVELY BULLETS.
CUTE.
NOTICE THE SMOOTH JACKET.
PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE TIP.
NOW YOU'VE ALL SEEN THESE VESTS
STOP A.357 MAGNUM BULLET.
ALL: YEAH.
RIGGS: OKAY.
OBSERVE.
[GUN BLAST]
[GUN CHAMBER CLICKS]
[PULLEY MECHANISM HUMS]
RIGGS: SON OF A BITCH!
COP 1: ARMOR-PIERCING BULLETS?
RIGGS: YEAH, COP KILLERS.
THOSE BULLETS CAME FROM THE GUN
OF A SUSPECT WE ARRESTED YESTERDAY.
THEY'RE OUT THERE ON THE STREETS.
VESTS ARE OPTIONAL, BOYS AND GIRLS.
ESPECIALLY BOYS.
SEE YOU, RIGGS.
ROGER: COP KILLERS.
[WHISPERS] SON OF A BITCH.
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO BILLY PHELPS.
I'LL HAVE HIM BROUGHT IN FOR INTERROGATION.
I'M HERE TO TALK TO BILLY PHELPS.
- CAN I SEE YOUR ID, PLEASE?
- SURE.
WILLIAM PHELPS, ARMORED CAR SUSPECT.
HE'S BEEN MOVED TO INTERROGATION.
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS?
- SURE. I'VE BEEN THERE A LOT.
ROGER: SAME FLOOR.
[WHISPERS] I GUESS NOW YOU'RE RETIRING,
THAT SWISS BANK ACCOUNT...
...WILL COME IN PRETTY HANDY.
HOW MUCH YOU GOT IN THERE, A MILLION?
MILLION AND A HALF?
ROGER: FIVE.
RIGGS: FIVE?
WELL, YOU DESERVE IT.
IT'S BETTER THAN THOSE
MISERABLE DRUG DEALERS GETTING IT.
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
DON'T SWEAT IT. YOU LAUNDERED IT,
DIDN'T YOU? THEY CAN'T TRACE IT.
RIGGS: THEY CAN'T TRACE IT.
ROGER: WHAT?
SO LONG AS I GET AN INVITE
TO CASA DE MURTAUGH, I'M HAPPY.
CASA WHAT?
- I'VE NEVER BEEN TO PORTUGAL.
- STOP JOKING.
SHE'S A COP!
I KNOW SHE'S A COP.
SHE'S PROBABLY ON THE TAKE, TOO.
THE WHOLE FORCE IS BENT.
RIGGS: SHE MAY BE WEARING A SKIRT,
BUT WE'RE ALL BROTHERS.
YOU KNOW I HAVE NOTHING.
I AIN'T BEEN TO PORTUGAL.
RIGGS: LISTEN TO ME.
LORNA: [WHISPERS] SON OF A BITCH.
OFFICER: HOW'RE YOU DOING?
LORNA: FINE.
OFFICER: WHO IS IT TODAY?
RIGGS & LORNA: BILLY PHELPS.
WHO'RE YOU?
FLY ME. I'M YOUR FRIENDLY
PORTUGUESE AIRLINE.
SHE'S INFERNAL AFFAIRS, ROG.
LORNA: HOW'D YOU KNOW?
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF LOOKING AT YOUR FILE FOLDER.
LORNA COLE.
- AND YOU'RE SERGEANT MURTAUGH.
- I USED TO BE.
WHAT'S INFERNAL REPAIRS
WANT WITH OUR COLLAR?
WE'RE TAKING OVER, THANKS.
NOBODY TOLD US THEY WERE TAKING OVER.
NOBODY HAS TO TELL YOU ANYTHING,
PATROLMAN.
I WANT TO GO AND SEE THE CAPTAIN.
YOU WANT TO SEE THE CAPTAIN?
LET'S GO SEE THE CAPTAIN.
LORNA: AND PUT ON A VEST.
RIGGS: OH, ARE YOU WEARING ONE?
ROGER: JUST TAKE IT EASY, MAN.
[RIGGS SIGHS DEEPLY]
[ELEVATOR RINGS]
HEY, GUYS. PHELPS, WILLIAM.
ACTUALLY, HIS NAME'S BILLY.
OFFICER: YOU, TOO?
OFFICER: POPULAR GUY TODAY.
JACK: SOMEBODY WITH HIM?
NO, NOT REALLY.
HE'S DOWN THE HALL TO THE RIGHT.
WANT TO SIGN IN HERE, SARGE?
RIGGS: MISS.
RIGGS: WHAT'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOING HERE?
MURPHY: DON'T START.
I JUST FOUND OUT MYSELF.
THIS IS HERMAN WALTERS,
CHIEF OF INTELLIGENCE.
YOU HAVEN'T MET HIS DAUGHTER,
LORNA DOONE.
LORNA: PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
THE PHELPS CASE HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED
TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
RIGGS: WHY?
MURPHY: I CAN'T TELL YOU.
WALTERS: THAT'S CLASSIFIED.
WE BUSTED OUR BUNS BUSTING THIS GUY.
WE BUSTED HIM.
BUSTED IS RIGHT.
HE SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE HOSPITAL.
ROGER: HE DIDN'T BUCKLE UP.
RIGGS: WE EVEN CITED HIM.
I KNOW, I READ YOUR REPORT.
LORNA: OUR CASES HAVE, UNFORTUNATELY,
CROSSED PATHS HERE.
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.
WE'LL TAKE OVER FROM HERE.
CAPTAIN, WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
WALTERS: THAT'S CLASSIFIED.
ROGER: NO, I'M TALKING TO HIM.
I'M TELLING YOU...
NO, I SAID, "CAPTAIN."
I'M TALKING TO THE CAPTAIN.
WALTERS: THAT'S CLASSIFIED!
ROGER: I'M TALKING TO HIM!
RIGGS: THAT'S BULLSHIT!
MURPHY: RIGGS!
MURPHY: MAYBE THESE GUYS CAN CONTRIBUTE
SOMETHING TO THIS CASE?
FROM THEIR RECORDS,
THEY ONLY CONTRIBUTE MAYHEM AND CHAOS.
NO, I'M CHAOS, HE'S MAYHEM.
WE'RE A DOUBLE ACT.
WHAT ARE WE,
REQUIRED READING OR SOMETHING?
AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU ARE.
IT'S A CROSS BETWEEN POLICE GAZETTE
AND MAD MAGAZINE.
RIGGS: WHAT'S WRONG WITH MAD?
LORNA: NOTHING, I USED TO READ IT...
YOU'VE GOT SOME TASTE.
...WHEN I WAS 12.
RIGGS, LET'S GO.
ROGER: WE BUSTED HIM,
WE CAN TALK TO HIM.
WALTERS: CAPTAIN.
MURPHY: RIGGS. MURTAUGH.
MURPHY: GET YOUR ASSES BACK HERE.
YOU'LL BE NEEDING THESE.
I'M REINSTATING BOTH OF YOU.
ROGER: DON'T YOU JUST LOVE HIM?
RIGGS: YEAH.
ROGER: GOD!
YOU REALLY ARE A BEAUTIFUL MAN.
JUST GET RID OF THE BLUES.
MURPHY: THEY DON'T GO WITH YOUR PONYTAIL.
RIGGS: ABSOLUTELY NOT.
RIGGS: YEAH, RIGHT.
GET A HAIRCUT!
OF COURSE, I WON'T.
WALTERS: YOU'VE EXCEEDED YOUR AUTHORITY,
CAPTAIN.
MURPHY: THAT'S NOT HOW I SEE IT.
WALTERS: THAT'S HOW THE CHIEF WILL SEE IT.
- TAKE IT UP WITH HIM.
- I THINK I WILL.
CATCH UP WITH THEM. WE DON'T WANT THIS
SCREWED UP WITH COWBOY TACTICS.
SON OF A BITCH.
HI, BILLY.
JACK!
BYE, BILLY.
[MULTIPLE SILENCED GUNSHOTS]
SEE YOU, BILLY.
OFFICER: SERGEANT,
DID YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED?
NOT REALLY. IT'S A DEAD ISSUE, I'M AFRAID.
RIGGS: HOW LONG HAS PHELPS
BEEN DOING THIS?
LORNA: DOING WHAT?
RIGGS: THIS ARMORED-CAR THING.
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN ARMORED CARS.
I DON'T THINK SHE'S TELLING US EVERYTHING.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
BOY, THESE SIX DAYS ARE GOING TO BE ROUGH.
ROGER: GOD, BE GOOD TO ME.
MURPHY: SHIT, SON OF A BITCH KNEW
THERE WAS A CAMERA IN THE WALL.
DAMN IT!
HE DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS ONE
IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM.
ROGER: THERE ISN'T.
LORNA: WE INSTALLED THEM SIX MONTHS AGO.
LORNA: EVERY STATION.
MURPHY: THAT'S GREAT.
SIX MONTHS AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT?
THIS IS THE "POLICE POLICE," CAPTAIN.
"POLICE POLICE." VERY GOOD. CAN YOU SAY
THAT THREE TIMES IN A ROW, REAL FAST?
RIGGS: WHY? AM I GETTING TO YOU?
LORNA: ARE YOU TRYING TO BAIT ME?
I'M A MASTER AT IT.
THAT FIGURES.
BAITING MASTER. GREAT, MAN,
TRY ALL THE TRICKS.
FREEZE THAT. STOP IT.
MURPHY: JACK TRAVIS.
BOTH: WHO?
LIEUTENANT JACK EDWARD TRAVIS.
HE WAS ONE OF US.
MURPHY: HELL OF A BRUTAL COP.
HE COULD BEAT A CONFESSION OUT OF ANYONE.
A DIRTY COP.
LORNA: I'VE NEVER SEEN
SO MANY SUSPENSIONS...
... AND REPRIMANDS AND CHARGES
OF MISCONDUCT.
HE'S ALSO AS TOUGH AS THEY COME.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
I DON'T KNOW.
HIS PARTNER AND HIM WERE ON A STAKEOUT.
HE WENT FOR COFFEE, NEVER CAME BACK.
LOOKS LIKE HE'S HAD
ONE CAPPUCCINO TOO MANY.
WE'D BETTER BRIEF WALTERS.
LORNA: EXCUSE ME, CUTE STUFF.
RIGGS: THAT'S HARASSMENT.
ROGER: CUTE STUFF. THAT'S YOU.
RIGGS: CAPTAIN.
LORNA: BOYS, BOYS. JUST THE CAPTAIN.
YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS CASE ENDED
WHEN PHELPS HIT THE FLOOR.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK
AND BEAT YOUR STREET?
LEO: NOW'S THE TIME TO BUY.
MURPHY: NOT NOW.
- HEY, ROGER, ROGER!
- NOT NOW, LEO!
- NOT NOW!
- WE GOT TO TALK, BABE, OKAY?
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. YOU'VE GOT TERMITES.
TERMITES?
- OH, GOD!
- YOU'RE INFESTED!
THE ONLY THING HOLDING UP YOUR HOUSE
IS THE PAINT.
WE SHOULD GO.
LEO, COULD YOU GET THE PLACE FUMIGATED?
WE SHOULD PULL EVERY FILE ON THIS GUY.
I KNOW THIS GUY.
ARE YOU WATCHING GERALDO?
RIGGS: WHAT?
LEO: I KNOW THE GUY.
RIGGS: HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?
LEO: I'VE SEEN THE GUY BEFORE.
ROGER: WHERE?
LEO: I DON'T KNOW. I RECOGNIZE HIM...
HIS NAME IS JACK TRAVIS.
DOES THAT RING A BELL?
HANDS OFF THE CLOTHES. OKAY?
I'M THINKING. LET ME THINK.
IT WAS A BIG PARTY.
SOMEONE BROUGHT A MONKEY
THAT KNOCKED OVER THE SALAD BAR.
AND THIS GUY COMES IN
AND INTRODUCES ME TO ANOTHER GUY...
...WHO WANTS A FAVOR.
- I GOT IT! I GOT IT!
- WHAT?
HE'S GOT IT!
- I REMEMBER!
- YOU REMEMBER!
DON'T DO IT. DON'T LET THE EARRING FOOL YOU.
- WE'RE BACK. WE'RE BACK!
- YEAH. YEAH.
LISTEN, LISTEN.
CAN I HAVE A GUN THIS TIME?
[ECHOING] NO!
[CRASH, AMBIENT GAME NOISE]
[SCATTERED CHEERING, HOLLERING]
OKAY, THIS IS IT! THESE GUYS ALWAYS
WANTED ME TO DO FAVORS FOR THEM!
LIKE, SOME GUYS WANTED BROADS,
ANOTHER GUY WANTED CUBAN CIGARS.
YOUR GUY, HOCKEY!
LEO: THE BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE!
RIGGS: WHERE'RE THE SEATS?
ROGER: YEAH?
PROBABLY BY THE GLASS.
DOES "NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK"
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
WHY DON'T WE SPREAD OUT?
IF WE ALL TAKE A DIFFERENT DIRECTION,
IT'D BE LIKE OLD TIMES.
DON'T PUSH, LADY!
I'M ON POLICE BUSINESS HERE!
JUST TAKE IT EASY!

MR. JACK TRAVIS?
MR. JACK TRAVIS, THIS IS THE LAPD.
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE. WE KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE. JUST STAY IN YOUR SEAT.
DON'T BE STUPID.
I'LL BE THERE TO ESCORT YOU OUT IN A MINUTE.
THERE'S A POLICEMAN AT EVERY EXIT,
SO IT'S NO USE TRYING TO RUN.
ROGER: SMART SON OF A BITCH.
RIGGS: JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE.
THANKS FOR YOUR COOPERATION.
PLAY ON, BOYS.
[WHISTLE BLOWS, SCATTERED APPLAUSE]
FAN: COME ON, LET'S GO!
GET OUT OF MY FUCKING WAY!
OOH, OOH! RIGGS!
ROGER!
EXCUSE ME.
RIGGS!
REFEREE: YOU CAN'T BE ON THE ICE!
[THUD]
I GOT HIM! I GOT HIM!
LEO: YOU HAVE THE RIGHT...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
[REFEREE'S WHISTLE BLOWS]

[SILENCED GUNSHOT]
JACK: FUCKING WEASEL!
REFEREE: WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?
RIGGS: I'M LAPD! LAPD!
REFEREE: I DON'T CARE!
YOU CAN'T BE ON THE ICE!
ROGER: I GOT HIM!
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, PAL. STAY CALM.
LEO: MAKE SURE YOU TELL MY MOTHER!
WHERE'D HE GO?
DOWN THERE!
SON OF A... BITCH!
HE THINKS I DON'T KNOW I'M DYING.
I KNOW IT.
ROGER: YOU'LL BE OKAY.
LEO: I'M DYING, ROGER.
I'M CHOKING, SEE?
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY DIE.
ROGER: LEO, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
MY BODY'S NUMB! I CAN'T FEEL IT!
I'M GOING TO DIE, I KNOW IT! WHAT?
YOU'RE LYING ON THE ICE.
LEO: THAT'S WHY I'M COLD?
ROGER: THAT'S WHY YOU'RE COLD.
- THAT'S WHY I'M NUMB?
- THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NUMB.
BUT HE SHOT ME. LOOK AT ALL THE BLOOD.
ROGER: IT'S JUST A FLESH WOUND.
LEO: SO IT'S OKAY.
HE'S OKAY, HE'S OKAY!
HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT! HE'S ALIVE!
[CROWD CHEERS]
DOCTOR: BRING HIM THIS WAY.
LEO: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
LEO: I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT SHOT.
DOCTOR: CALM DOWN.
RIGGS, ARE YOU HERE?
WE'RE ALL THE SAME NOW. WE ALL GOT SHOT.
DOCTOR: YOU'LL BE FINE.
RELAX.
I'M FINE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.
I CAN TAKE THIS.
DOCTOR: JUST CALM DOWN.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. AAH!
DOCTOR: YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE TONIGHT.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA.
YOU SHOULDN'T RUSH THIS, DOC.
RIGGS: YOU SHOULD REST UP.
A DUM-DUM WOUND CAN BE SERIOUS.
WHAT'S A "DUM-DUM WOUND"?
YOU DON'T KNOW? A GUY ON THE FORCE
GOT HIS THUMB SHOT OFF BY A DUM-DUM.
FROM THE SHOCK,
HE WAS DEAD TWO DAYS LATER.
DEAD TWO DAYS LATER?
LEO: HE DIED FROM DUM-DUMS?
DOCTOR: WE'LL KEEP YOU OVERNIGHT.
ROGER: MAKE IT TWO.
TWO DAYS?
OKAY, WE'LL KEEP HIM TWO DAYS.
IS THAT LEO'S CHART?
DOCTOR: TWO DAYS,
THEN YOU'LL BE AS GOOD AS NEW.
LEO: I SHOULD BE WITH THEM.
I SHOULD BE WITH... OW, OW!
HOW DO YOU SPELL, "PROCTOLOGICAL"?
ROGER: RECTAL EXAM?
- NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO LEO.
- SURE, WE CAN.
WHY'S SHE...
PLEASE, MR. GETZ.
DOCTOR: YOU'VE BEEN SHOT IN THE ARM?
LET HER TAKE IT. YOU'LL GET IT BACK.
DOCTOR: THERE'S A CLOCK IN YOUR ROOM.
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A "DUM-DUM WOUND"?
RIGGS: IT SOUNDED LIKE ONE
WHEN IT HAPPENED.
LEO: SHIT.
RIGGS: TAKE IT EASY. TWO DAYS.
DOCTOR: TWO DAYS AND YOU'LL BE OUT.
NO PROBLEM.
LEO: I'LL SEE YOU GUYS.
RIGGS: WE WON'T MAKE A MOVE
WITHOUT YOU.
I THOUGHT THAT BULLET SOUNDED DIFFERENT.
DOCTOR: RELAX.
THEY'LL BE THERE WHEN YOU GET OUT.
LEO: I'M FINE.
LEO: YOU OWN YOUR HOUSE, DOC?
DOCTOR: WHAT?
- YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE MY FACE?
- NO, SIR.
WATCH.
RIGGS: IT'S ABOUT TIME. THESE DOGGY TREATS
ARE OKAY, BUT I NEED SOME HUMAN FOOD.
ROGER: DON'T WORRY. I'LL MAKE YOU
THE BEST THING YOU'VE EVER HAD.
RIGGS: GOOD.
ROGER: YOU EVER EAT
ONE OF MY HAMBURGERS?
RIGGS: I'VE BEEN LUCKY SO FAR.
ROGER: FAST EDDIE!
ROGER: HOW'S BUSINESS?
EDDIE: BOOMING. CAN'T YOU TELL?
ROGER: YEAH, I'M LOOKING AT IT.
DID YOU MEET MY PARTNER?
I WANT TO COOK ONE
OF THOSE MONSTER BURGERS FOR HIM.
EDDIE: GO FOR IT.
ROGER: ALL RIGHT.
RIGGS: YOU'LL LET HIM COOK?
EDDIE: DO I HAVE A CHOICE?
ROGER: NO, BECAUSE IT'S WEDNESDAY.
RIGGS: HE'S TOO BIG TO ARGUE WITH.
IN THAT CASE, GIVE ME A MACROG.
RIGGS: HOLD THE HAIR.
DID YOU WASH YOUR HANDS?
KEEP JOKING. BUT I GUARANTEE
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS BURGER...
...AND YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY FRIENDS,
YOU KNOW THAT, EXCEPT YOU.
ROGER: HE'S A COMEDIAN IN HIS SPARE TIME.
WHEN IS HE GONNA SAY SOMETHING FUNNY?
ARE YOU GONNA PUT THAT OUT?
RIGGS: YOU'RE FINISHED WITH IT, YEAH?
DO YOU MIND? THANKS.
SORRY. I WAS JUST LOOKING AT IT.
CHEW ON THIS ONION.
HE'S QUITTING, SO HELP HIM.
I WAS ONLY LOOKING AT IT.
ROGER: THE FIRST THING IS THE FAT.
ROGER: EVERYONE SAYS, "CUT THE FAT."
MY UNCLE SAID, "YOU CUT THE FAT,
YOU KILL THE BURGER." RIGHT?
EDDIE: YEAH.
ROGER: THERE'S AN ART TO IT.
YOU JUST CAN'T PLOP THIS ON THE GRILL.
ROGER: GENTLY COAX THE FLAVORS OUT.
YO, HEY, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
ROGER: A LITTLE PEPPER,
THEN YOU MASSAGE IT A LITTLE BIT.
JUST A LITTLE BIT.
[SINGS] "SWEET, SWEET MEAT"
SHIT, MAN, FEEL IT.
OKAY, GUYS!
RIGGS: LAPD. LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS! GET THEM UP!
RIGGS: IN THE CAR! GET THEM UP THERE!
LET ME SEE BOTH OF THEM! COME ON!
[MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS]
HEY, RIGGS!
[GUNSHOTS]
[TIRES SCREECH]
[RIGGS GROANS]
RIGGS!
ROGER: DON'T YOU LOVE ME? FOR FIVE DAYS!
[BANG]
DON'T DO THAT TO ME!
ROGER: RIGGS, ARE YOU OKAY?
RIGGS: YEAH.
WHO DID IT?
ROGER: ALL RIGHT, ASSHOLE!
I WANT TO SEE YOUR HANDS, RIGHT NOW!
[MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS]
BACK ME UP, RIGGS!
ROGER: DARRYL?
FUCK, NO!
FUCK, NO!
CALL AN AMBULANCE!
CALL AN AMBULANCE! BREATHE!
ROGER: PLEASE, BREATHE!
BREATHE!
CALL AN AMBULANCE!
COME ON! BREATHE! OH, GOD!
FUCK, IT'S DARRYL!
OH, GOD, DON'T DO THIS TO ME! BREATHE!
RIGGS: HE'S DEAD.
ROGER: BREATHE! BREATHE!
ROGER: GOD, DON'T DO THIS!
RIGGS: HE'S DEAD.
RIGGS: HE'S DEAD! ROG, HE'S DEAD!
HE'S DEAD, ROG!
DON'T MESS WITH THE CORPSE.
HE'S DEAD. COME ON, MAN,
IT WAS A CLEAN SHOOT.
IT'S OKAY, IT WAS A CLEAN SHOOT.
HE WAS GONNA DO YOU
AND HE WAS GONNA DO ME.
IT'S OKAY. ARE YOU OKAY?
IT'S NOT OKAY.
I KNOW THAT KID.
I KNOW THAT KID.
ROGER: HE'S NICK'S FRIEND.
[PHONE RINGS]
NICK: I GOT IT, MOM.
TRISH: I'LL GET IT.
HELLO?
HI, MARTIN.
HE'S NOT HERE.
[WHISPERS] OH, MY GOD!
THANKS.
[CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT]
FUCK!
[TIRES SCREECH]
RIGGS: HOW'RE YOU DOING?
TAKING YOUR VITAMINS?
MURPHY: RIGGS, HOW'S MURTAUGH?
RIGGS: HE'S GOOD. HE'S FINE.
- I'M SURE HE'S ANYTHING BUT FINE.
- REALLY, HE'S OKAY.
- I'D REALLY LIKE TO TALK TO HIM.
- THAT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO LEAVE HIM ALONE.
LET'S GET SOMETHING FOR YOUR COLD.
DOCTOR: I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
LORNA: WE HAVE TO TALK.
RIGGS: TALKING TO YOU IS BAD FOR MY IMAGE.
LORNA: I'M AFRAID I INSIST.
RIGGS: OH, YOU INSIST?
IN THAT CASE, LET'S FIND SOMEPLACE PRIVATE.
STEP INTO MY ORIFICE.
RIGGS: HEY, BECKER, HOW'S IT HANGING?
BECKER: HEY, RIGGS.
BECKER: CLIP ANY WRONG WIRES LATELY?
RIGGS: I HAVEN'T DONE THAT
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.
NEXT TIME, WAIT FOR THE BOMB SQUAD.
BECKER: YEAH, IT'S OUR JOB.
I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
WE SAVED A CAT, THOUGH.
GREAT. I LOVE CATS.
RIGGS: GO AHEAD, TALK. I'M LISTENING.
YOU PURPOSEFULLY WITHHELD INFORMATION
CONCERNING A CASE UNDER MY INVESTIGATION.
DAMN RIGHT, I DID.
BECKER: CAREFUL, SHE'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
YOU HAD A TIP ON TRAVIS.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SHARED IT WITH ME.
NO, I TAKE THAT BACK.
YOU WERE REQUIRED TO SHARE IT WITH ME.
I WAS "REQUIRED" TO SHARE IT WITH YOU?
I DON'T HAVE TO SHARE SHIT WITH YOU.
SCHOOL YARD RULES: IF YOU DON'T SCRATCH
MY BACK, I DON'T THROW YOU...
LORNA: OH, COME ON, RIGGS.
I CAN'T DO THAT!
RIGGS: YES, YOU CAN!
WHY DON'T YOU CUT OUT
THIS CLASSIFIED BULLSHIT!
RIGHT NOW! IT'S GIVING ME THE SHITS!
WE'RE COPS. YOU'RE A COP, I'M A COP.
WE'RE BOTH ON THE SAME SIDE, RIGHT?
RIGGS: RIGHT?
LORNA: RIGHT!
GOOD! WHY DON'T WE START TO ACT LIKE IT.
THERE ARE KIDS OUT THERE. BABIES. NO
BRAINS, BUT THEY GOT AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
RIGGS: YESTERDAY,
MY PARTNER NAILED THIS KID...
I KNOW ABOUT MURTAUGH.
YEAH. AND I'M SORRY, RIGGS.
YEAH.
[SIGHS DEEPLY]
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME IN ON THIS?
I CAN HELP YOU.
I REALLY WANT TO HELP YOU,
IF YOU'LL LET ME. LET ME.
WHAT DO YOU SAY? HAVE WE GOT A DEAL?
WASH YOUR HANDS...
...AND MEET ME IN MY OFFICE.
YEAH.
RIGGS: I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
LORNA: MAC-10, 9 MM, SEMI-AUTOMATIC...
BOTH: CONVERTED TO AUTOMATIC
WITH 36 ROUNDS IN THE MAGAZINE.
"ON A SESAME SEED BUN."
VERY ILLEGAL.
THE GUN HAS A HISTORY.
WANNA KNOW ABOUT IT?
TELL ME.
"KILLED A CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK
IN LA COUNTY, JULY 1990.
"USED IN A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING
IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, AUGUST 1990.
"CONFISCATED BY A TRUANT OFFICER
OF THE LA SCHOOL BOARD, OCTOBER 1990."
SCHEDULED FOR DESTRUCTION BY LAPD
SIX WEEKS AGO.
"SCHEDULED FOR DESTRUCTION?"
LORNA: BUT IT NEVER GOT THERE.
INSTEAD, IT FOUND ITS WAY
INTO THE HANDS OF A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY...
...WHO FIRED IT ON A POLICE OFFICER,
YOUR PARTNER.
I THOUGHT IT LOOKED FAMILIAR.
LORNA:
THAT GUN AND 15,000 OTHERS LIKE IT...
...WERE STOLEN FROM A POLICE STORAGE FACILITY
BEFORE THEY COULD BE DESTROYED.
THEY SHOULD BE PAPER CLIPS RIGHT NOW,
OR LICENSE PLATES.
ANYTHING BUT A GUN. HERE WE ARE
BUSTING OUR ASSES ON THE STREETS...
...GETTING THESE WEAPONS OUT OF CIRCULATION
AND NOW THEY'RE HEADED BACK OUT.
BY BUSTING PHELPS, YOU STUMBLED ONTO
SOMETHING THE LAPD'S TRIED TO KEEP QUIET.
THAT'S WHY INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS ONTO THIS.
THEY THINK THIS IS AN INSIDE JOB.
LORNA: THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY KNEW POLICE PROCEDURES.
THEY KNEW WHERE THE GUNS WERE STORED
AND HOW TO GET IN.
THEY EVEN KNEW THE SORTING CODES
ON THE CONTAINERS...
...BECAUSE THEY TOOK THE AUTOMATICS
AND LEFT THE JUNK BEHIND.
LORNA: IT ALL POINTED TO A COP.
RIGGS: OR AN EX-COP.
RIGHT.
BOTH: TRAVIS.
AND YOU LET HIM SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS.
THAT'S CLOSER THAN YOU EVER GOT.
CLOSE, RIGGS?
CLOSE IS A LINGERIE SHOP
WITHOUT A FRONT WINDOW.
DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR A RIDE?
SURE, WHERE ARE WE GOING?
LORNA: IT'S A SURPRISE.
OH, I LOVE SURPRISES.
RIGGS: WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
LORNA: I ACCESSED BILLY PHELPS'
PHONE RECORDS ON MY COMPUTER.
LORNA: HE MADE A DOZEN CALLS
TO THIS ADDRESS.
RIGGS: THAT WAS NICE OF YOU
TO STEAL THAT INFORMATION.
LORNA: SEMANTICS, RIGGS.
RIGGS: "SEMANTICS"?
RIGGS: I'M ALWAYS UP FOR SOME ANTICS.
LET'S GO ON THREE.
LORNA: ONE.

LORNA: I HATE DOGS, RIGGS.
I DON'T GET IT.
YOU DON'T GET WHAT?
IT'S A DOG. IT'S A FUCKING DOG.
I DON'T GET, "CLOSE, IS A LINGERIE SHOP
WITHOUT A FRONT WINDOW." I DON'T GET IT.
LATER.
[GROWLING]
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
I CAN'T SHOOT A DOG.
PEOPLE, OKAY, BUT NOT DOGS.
I SHOULD TRY TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH HIM.
MAKE FRIENDS?
NOW DON'T RUN, BECAUSE HE'LL ONLY
CHASE YOU DOWN AND KILL YOU.
RIGGS: HERE, BOY.

YOU WANT ME TO GO?

TYRONE: HATCHETT, YOU SAID NOT TO WORRY
ABOUT THE POLICE...
... BUT THE COPS ARE ALL OVER YOU!
THEY GOT MY GUNS.
THEY'LL COME AFTER ME, NEXT!
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THE DEAL'S OFF!
GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF, TYRONE.
WE HAVE A DEAL.
NOBODY BACKS OUT.
TYRONE: YOU SAID YOU HAD THE COPS
UNDER CONTROL.
I SEE THAT ISN'T SO. GIVE ME ONE REASON...
TYRONE:
... WHY I SHOULD DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD REASON.
TYRONE, THIS IS TRAVIS.
YOU BACK OUT NOW, AND I'LL MAKE SURE
ONLY YOUR DENTIST CAN IDENTIFY THE BODY.
IS THAT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON FOR YOU?
BUT I NEED AMMO!
I'M OUT OF BUSINESS WITHOUT AMMO!
I NEED THE GOOD STUFF.
YOU'LL GET THE AMMO. THE GOOD STUFF.
"THE GOOD STUFF." JESUS.
JACK: TIME TO PAY
ANOTHER VISIT TO THE LAPD.
YOU LOOK LIKE I FEEL.
HEY?
RIGGS: HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING
I CAN PUT ON MY HEAD?
THE HAT IN THE CLOSET.
YOU'RE ALL HEART. HERE I THOUGHT
YOU'D GET ALL TENDER AND MATERNAL.
I WAS RAISED WITH FOUR BROTHERS.
WE GOT HURT OFTEN, BUT IF NO BONES WERE
BROKEN OR BLOOD GUSHED, NOBODY CARED.
LOOK, BLOOD. SEE? BLOOD.
LORNA: IT'S NOT GUSHING.
RIGGS: IT WAS FREE FALLING EARLIER.
COULD YOU BRING ME A NEEDLE AND THREAD?
SOME PEROXIDE. I'LL PATCH IT UP MYSELF.
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.
I WASN'T.
WHAT'S WITH YOU?
[THREE STOOGES THEME MUSIC PLAYS

RIGGS: BOYS.
LORNA: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LORNA: I SAID NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING.
RIGGS: IT CAME ON BY ITSELF.
ALL BY ITSELF. WHAT ARE YOU, A WISE GUY?
RIGGS: YOU DON'T LIKE TO SHARE YOUR TOYS?
- THIS ISN'T A TOY.
- WHAT IS IT?
- THIS IS A WEAPON.
- A WEAPON?
USED PROPERLY, A VERY EFFECTIVE WEAPON.
WHAT, DO YOU THROW IT AT PEOPLE?

OH, GOD.
HOLD STILL.
LORNA: OH, GOD. WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.
BE GENTLE WITH ME.
I SEE THIS ISN'T VIRGIN TERRITORY.
WHAT IS THIS? A KNIFE?
THAT'S AN AX.
SOME GUY MISTOOK MY HEAD FOR A LOG.
- THAT'S A NATURAL MISTAKE.
- WHAT, I HAVE A WOODEN HEAD?
- LOOK AT THAT.
- A KNIFE.
KNIFE? THAT'S VERY NICE.
THIS IS ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S PAVEMENT, DRAGGED DOWN CRENSHAW.
THAT'S GREAT. LOOK AT THAT TEXTURE.
LOOK AT THIS.
SAME THING. THIRD AND HIGHLAND.

LORNA: MOVING TRUCK?
MOVING BULLET.
RIGGS: MOVING BULLET?
LORNA: HERE. THIS IS THE BEST.
IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE BACK.
RIGGS: RIGHT THROUGH?
YOU'RE LUCKY. WAS IT A.22?
IT'S A.38.
THAT'S A.38? THAT'S WIMPY.
THIS IS A.38.
YOURS IS BIGGER THAN MINE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
MAYBE NOT, BUT LOOK.
A WHOLE FAMILY OF.44S ON THE BACK.
RIGGS: THERE THEY ARE.
LORNA: THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

I CAN BEAT IT. I CAN BEAT IT.

- YOU GOTTA SEE THIS.
LORNA: I BELIEVE YOU.
RIGGS: THIS GUY HAD A KNIFE.
RIGGS: YOU'LL LOVE IT. HE STUCK IT IN MY LEG
AND RAN IT AROUND EIGHT TIMES.
LORNA: I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
RIGGS: LOOK!
NO, I SAID FORGET IT.
THIS IS A BLUE-RIBBON EVENT.
FORGET IT, RIGGS.
YOU STARTED THIS.
LORNA: YEAH, I CAN END IT.

YOU'RE A VERY POOR LOSER.
I DIDN'T LOSE.
RIGGS: YES, YOU DID.
LORNA: NO, I DIDN'T LOSE.
RIGGS: YOU LOST.
LORNA: I CONCEDED.
NO, I CONCEDED. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN LOSING AND CONCEDING.
YOU CONCEDED OR YOU'RE CONCEITED?
LORNA: YOU THINK I'M CONCEITED?
RIGGS: YEAH.
TELL ME YOU LOST. ADMIT TO IT.
I'LL GET YOU A BAND-AID.

THIS PLACE IS BETTER THAN THE SWAP MEET.
BEST BARGAINS IN TOWN.
COP: GIVE ME THE LOCK-UP KEYS.
THOSE GUYS FROM THE GARAGE,
THEY'RE ALL EX-CONS.
THEY WERE ALL BUSTED BY THE SAME
POLICE OFFICER, JACK EDWARD TRAVIS.
EARLY PAROLES ON
THE WORK-FURLOUGH PROGRAM.
EMPLOYED BY A COMPANY CALLED
MESA VERDE CONSTRUCTION.
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.
YOU DON'T HAVE A PASS.
- MAY I SEE YOUR PASS?
- MY PASS?
HERE'S MY PASS.
LEO: I GOT SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
ROGER: HE'S WITH US.
- HE'S WITH US?
- I SAID THAT?
WHERE'D YOU GET HER FROM?
RIGGS: WHY AREN'T YOU IN THE HOSPITAL?
DON'T MENTION THE HOSPITAL.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO LEAVE ME THERE.
THEY TRIED TO TAKE MY APPENDIX OUT.
LEO: THEY GAVE ME A LAPOTOMY.
- BRAIN SURGERY?
- A LAPOTOMY.
NOT A LOBOTOMY.
CUT YOUR HAIR SO YOU CAN HEAR.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
THE DIFFERENCE IS, FOR A LAPOTOMY,
THEY SHAVE YOUR NETHER REGIONS.
NETHER WHAT?
NETHER... I CAN'T SAY IT IN FRONT OF HER.
POINT TO IT.
- HERE.
- IT MUST BE ITCHY.
IT IS ITCHY. THESE DOCTORS ARE SAVAGES.
WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT A GUNSHOT WOUND
REQUIRES A RECTAL EXAM?
LEO: HUH? HUH?
YEAH. WITH A TELESCOPE
BIG ENOUGH TO SEE VENUS.
I GUESS ALL THEY SAW WAS URANUS.
THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU.
LEO: YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY?
THEY FUCK YOU IN THE HOSPITAL.
FIRST THEY DRUG YOU, THEN THEY FUCK YOU!
WHEN THEY'RE DONE...
...THE INSURANCE COMPANY COMES
AND FUCKS YOU SOME MORE!
$10 FOR A FUCKING ASPIRIN
AND IT ISN'T EVEN COVERED!
THAT'S ENOUGH!
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK HERE.
SO, WHAT'S NEW ON OUR CASE?
ANYTHING NEW? YOU GOT TRAVIS YET?
DID YOU GUYS ADVERTISE?
- HE'S FAMILY.
- WHO'S SHE?
- SERGEANT COLE.
- HOW ARE YOU? LEO GETZ.
ANYTHING YOU NEED, LEO GETS. GET IT?
- I GET IT.
- IT'S REAL ESTATE, NOW...
LISTEN, COME ON, YOU GUYS,
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I OWE THIS GUY ONE.
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO.
YOU CAN GET US A CUP OF COFFEE.
THAT'S GREAT. I TAKE ONE FOR YOU
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU TELL ME?
RIGGS: HE COULD CHECK THIS OUT.
LEO: THAT'S ALL I'M GOOD FOR?
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO.
CHECK OUT MESA VERDE CONSTRUCTION.
FIND OUT ALL THE INFORMATION YOU CAN.
- SURE, I CAN DO THIS.
- CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT NAME?
MESA VERDE, I GOT IT.
WAIT, WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IF THERE'S ANY SHIT THERE, HE'LL FIND IT.
LORNA: WHO IS THAT GUY?
RIGGS: IT'S A LONG STORY.
HERE ARE YOUR KEYS, CAPTAIN.
YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
- DON'T BE STUPID.
- WHAT THE FUCK?
TAKE THE ELEVATOR, GET THE OTHER GUYS.
KEYS. GIVE ME THOSE FUCKING HANDS.
GODDAMN YOU, TRAVIS. FUCK.
STAND THERE.
I CAN GET FASTER RESULTS THAN
THAT REAL ESTATE BROKER.
RIGGS: LEO'S NOT JUST A REAL ESTATE BROKER.
ROGER: HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS
WITH A LOT OF CONNECTIONS.
JACK: THIS IS WHAT WE CAME FOR.
LOAD EVERYTHING ON THE ELEVATOR.
- HOW'D YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND THEM?
- WE GOT IT ALL, JACK.
THE WORLD OF COMPUTERS, MURPH...
YOU USED TO BE ONE OF US, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
YOU KNOW WHAT FUTURE A COP HAS? NONE.
PUNCH A CLOCK FOR 30 YEARS. RETIREMENT.
PENSION.
NOTHING TO DO.
DRUNK AT NOON, BULLET IN THE BRAIN
BY EVENING. NOT FOR THIS KID.
POLICE DEPARTMENT'S GOT IT ALL:
GUNS, AMMO, DRUGS, CASH.
IT'S A ONE-STOP SHOPPING CENTER
IF YOU GOT THE BALLS AND THE BRAINS.
NOT A THING ANYBODY CAN DO ABOUT IT.
YOU'RE ALREADY FUCKING HISTORY
AND YOU KNOW IT.
SORRY. I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.
SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE.
THE PROGRAM'S BEEN ACCESSED
BY SOMEBODY FROM THE OUTSIDE.
WHAT'S BEEN ACCESSED?
AFTER THE GUNS WERE STOLEN, INTERNAL AFFAIRS
MOVED THE CONFISCATED AMMUNITION.
ARMOR-PIERCING BULLETS?
THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS
TO A MORE SECURE LOCATION.
- THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN ACCESSED.
- SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS.
WHERE'S THIS STORE? WHERE'D THEY MOVE IT?
LORNA: LET'S GO.

I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU,
BUT LORNA'S PREGNANT.
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
YOU'LL BE A FATHER!
SHE WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU.
SHE WAS AFRAID YOU'D GET ANGRY.
YOU NEVER TALKED ABOUT CHILDREN?
-SHIT!
-A BABY.
THERE'S SOMETHING I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU TOO.
RIANNE'S PREGNANT. YOU'RE GOING
TO BE A GRANDFATHER.
RIANNE'S WHAT?!
RIANNE CAN'T BE PREGNANT.
SHE'S NOT MARRIED.
I DON'T THINK SHE INTENDED TO GET THAT WAY.
THEY ASKING ME TO BE A GRANDDADDY?
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO.
TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF!
WHAT FOR?
OKAY, YOU RUN.
FLAME-O SEES YOU IN YOUR UNDIES.
IT DISTRACTS HIM, THEN I SHOOT.
-SHOOT WHAT?
-THE VALVE ON THAT NAPALM TANK!
BEFORE HE SHOOTS ME?
-MAYBE.
-MAYBE?!
IS HE BLACK?
TOO MUCH ARMOR ON.
I CAN'T TELL!
NO! NOT HIM!
THE FATHER OF THE BABY!
PLEASE LET HIM BE BLACK!
GET GOING! HERE HE COMES!
ARE THOSE HEARTS?
NOT NOW, RIGGS.
JUST HIT THE DAMN VALVE!
ALSO, FLAP AND MAKE NOISES LIKE A BIRD.
FLAP MY ARMS? WHY?
IT'LL DISTRACT HIM MORE.
I NEED HIM TO TURN.
-ON 2!
-WE ALWAYS GO ON 3.
NO TIME FOR 3. 2!
-WHAT ABOUT 1?
-OKAY. 1, 2, GO!
I DON'T WANT TO DIE IN MY UNDERWEAR!
WHY ARE YOU WAITING?
SHOOT THE BASTARD!
RIGGS, YOU THINK THAT BIRD THING HELPED?
I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU'D DO IT.
CUTE SHORTS.
GO SPIT!
I'LL BUY YOU A DOUGHNUT.
DON'T HUG ME WHEN I'M NAKED.
YOU'RE ASHAMED OF YOUR BUTT?
HE'S A LIVELY ONE.
THAT SHARK HURTS MY BOAT,
I TAKE IT OUT ON YOU, LEO.
-I DIDN'T MEAN TO CATCH IT.
-WHY DO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT?
YEAH, WHY KEEP A SHARK?
THE TEETH'LL LOOK GREAT ON A WALL.
THEY GOT TO STOP SNAPPING FIRST.
MAYBE HE'LL FALL ASLEEP.
CONVERSE WITH HIM.
HE'LL NOD OFF.
-HE DON'T LOOK TIRED.
-CHEWING ON LEO WILL WEAR HIM OUT.
SHARKS EAT THEIR OWN KIND?
STOP IT!
I'M IN STITCHES!
OKAY, WHERE'S MY BAG?
STARBOARD SIDE AFT.
STARBOARD, THAT'S LEFT, RIGHT?
NO, PORT'S LEFT.
STARBOARD'S RIGHT.

-WHATEVER.
-CHECK BOTH SIDES.
CAREFUL!
HE'S BEHIND YOU, SHARK!
MAYBE WE SHOULD THROW HIM OVERBOARD.
THROW THEM BOTH OVERBOARD.
NO WITNESSES.
WE'D PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH IT.
YOU TOO?
I KEPT MY NOSE OUT OF IT...
...BUT YOU AND LORNA.
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY,
YOU'RE LIVING TOGETHER.
YOU'RE NOT MARRYING.
WHY, DOES THAT VIOLATE YOUR
FAMILY VALUES SYSTEM?
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
RIANNE'S NOT MARRIED EITHER.
THAT'S HITTING BELOW THE BELT.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS MARRIED...
...IT WAS GOOD. YOU KNOW.
YOU PUT THE RING ON.
YOU MAKE THE COMMITMENT.
YOU DO ALL THE....
SHE'S DEAD BECAUSE I'M A COP.
SHE'S DEAD BECAUSE I'M A COP AND I...
I DON'T WEAR THE RING ANYMORE...
...BUT I LOOK, AND IT'S STILL THERE.
I STILL FEEL IT.
IT'S LIKE I'M NOT FINISHED WITH THAT YET.
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
IS THAT BULLSHIT?
NO. IT'S NOT FINISHED.
IT'S NOT FINISHED.
OKAY, YOU DID SAY "AFT"?
A-F-T. AFT!
THAT'S A FUCKING WORD?
IN THE BACK ON THE RIGHT SIDE, LEO!
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT
TO BEGIN WITH, ROGER?!
PEOPLE GET AROUND BOATS AND WATER,
EVERYTHING BECOMES NAUTICAL!
"ASTERN! AVAST, YOU LANDLUBBERS!
MAN THE BILGE PUMP!"
PUMP YOUR FUCKING ASS!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM!
WHAT'S LORNA SAY ABOUT IT?
SHE DOESN'T LIKE NAUTICAL TERMS EITHER.
WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT.
THAT'S PRETTY MESSED UP.
THE BABY'S DUE IN DAYS AND YOU
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT MARRYING?
NO.
I HAVEN'T DONE IT AT ALL.
DO WE WANT LEO TO SHOOT THE SHARK?
I WANT LEO TO SHOOT...
NO, LEO!
WHAT?!
-WHAT'S THE DEAL?!
-YOU'RE SHOOTING A GUN ON MY BOAT!
I'M NOT SHOOTING YOUR BOAT,
I'M SHOOTING JAWS.
NOBODY'S KILLING IT
JUST TO HAVE ITS TEETH!
YOU'RE GRUMPY SINCE YOU
LEARNED YOU'LL BE A GRANDPA.
GET OFF OF ME, WILL YOU?

-WHAT ABOUT THE SHARK?
SHARK!
DON'T LEAVE ME!
COME ON!
-HURRY UP!
-I'M COMING!
YOU'LL MAKE IT!
THIS IS ALL I GOT LEFT.
FOUR SETS OF PAPERS, TOTALLY GENUINE.
THEY'LL GET IN THE COUNTRY
AND CAN STAY FOREVER.
U.S. CITIZENS.
ASK THEM TO VOTE THE INCUMBENT PARTY.
HELP ME KEEP MY STATE DEPARTMENT JOB.
BLOODY MARVELOUS!
THEY RED-FLAG ASIAN VISAS.
THOSE WERE HARD TO SLIP THROUGH.
THE SHIP'S BEEN IMPOUNDED.
WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILY?
WE DON'T KNOW YET.
DON'T WORRY. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
SOMETHING WRONG?
A SMALL DELIVERY PROBLEM, MR. PROODY.
GOODBYE.
LEAVE!
I'LL FIND THEM.
NOW.
COAST GUARD INTERDICTS
ABOUT ONE A MONTH.
PRETTY RAGGEDY-LOOKING.
SIX WEEKS LOCKED IN A HOLE
WITH ONE TOILET.
RICE AND SOME FISH TO EAT.
LOUSY DEAL FOR 35 GRAND A HEAD.
WHERE'D THEY GET THAT KIND OF MONEY?
DIDN'T. GOT TO WORK IT OFF FROM
THE SNAKEHEADS, THE SMUGGLERS.
-THEY SELL THEM AS CHEAP LABOR.
-SELL THEM?
LIKE SLAVES.
THESE MUST BE THE LUCKY ONES.
THEY'LL CLAIM ASYLUM. SAY THEY WERE
PERSECUTED, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
WE'LL SEND THEM PACKING.
COST YOU AND ME A FORTUNE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO,
"BRING ME YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR...
...YOUR WRETCHED MASSES,
YEARNING TO BE FREE"?
NOW IT READS, "NO VACANCIES. "
I GUESS YOUR PARENTS
WERE NATIVE AMERICANS.
THEY POP ONE EVERY BOATLOAD.
SHOWS THE REST WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF THEY RUN OFF.
HE'S NOBODY'S SLAVE NOW.
DON'T CODDLE THEM, MOVE THEM!
I SEE THIS BARREL COMING DOWN.
MURTAUGH DIDN'T SEE IT,
SO I PUSH HIM.
I KNOCK HIM OVER.
WE'RE IN THE WATER.
I PULL BECAUSE HE CAN'T SWIM.
I GOT TO SAVE HIM.
THERE'S THAT KID.
WHAT'S HIS NAME? BISSEL?
-IT'S A FOOD.
-BURGER!
NO, BISCUITS OR SOMETHING.
HE ALWAYS KISSES MY ASS,
GIVES ME COFFEE AND SHIT.
SERGEANT RIGGS, SERGEANT MURTAUGH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-THAT'S A LONG STORY.
-YOU'RE ALL WET!
-YOU NEED A BLANKET?
-I'M FINE.
-SOMEBODY GET THIS MAN A BLANKET NOW!
-YES, SIR!
-GET THIS BODY OUT OF HERE.
-WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?
STEP BACK, STEP BACK.
SHIT!
HE'S DEAD.
HE'S FUCKING DEAD!
-SHIT!
-WHAT?
THIS IS HOW HE WANTED
TO COME TO AMERICA?
WAS HE IN THE KILLING SECTION?
THIS GUY'S BEEN SHOT FOUR TIMES!
AT CLOSE RANGE, LIKE HE WAS EXECUTED!
HE WAS EXECUTED.
BY THE CREW.
PEOPLE GET KILLED LEFT, RIGHT
AND CENTER IN THIS TOWN!
NOW WE IMPORT VICTIMS?
GANGBANGERS KILL EACH OTHER,
NO PROBLEM!
ONE OF US GETS SHOT,
OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD!
BUT JUST A NORMAL GUY?
WHAT DID HE EVER DO TO ANYBODY?!
-THAT AIN'T RIGHT.
-EASY, BISCUITS.
YOU'LL GET AN ULCER.
SETTLE DOWN.
BLANKET!
SORRY, BLANKETS.
SORRY, I'M LOSING MY HEAD.
I HATE TO SEE BAD THINGS
HAPPEN TO GOOD FOLK.
WE'D STICK AROUND, BUTLER,
BUT YOU'RE IN CHARGE SO...
YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS, IT'S FREE.
YOU'RE ALL WET.
-GET SOME VAPOR RUB ON YOUR CHEST.
-ALL RIGHT, BOOGERS.
HEY, GET THEM OUT OF HERE!
GET THEM OUT OF HERE!
HE TAKES THE JOB KIND OF PERSONALLY.
YEAH, HE'S PRETTY SERIOUS, I'D SAY.
OVERZEALOUS.
JEALOUS OF WHO?
-I DON'T KNOW. WHO?
-YOU SAID HE WAS JEALOUS.
YOU JUST SAID...
I SAID HE WAS ZEALOUS.
FULL OF ZEAL.
HE'S LOUD TOO.
-HE'S LOUD!
-WHAT?
WE BETTER GET UP
BEFORE THE SUN'S UP.
I GOT SOMETHING IN THE LIFEBOAT.
THAT'S OKAY,
I'LL CATCH A SQUAD RIDE.
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR BOAT.
-I'M SORRY.
-SHIT!
SUDDENLY, A BIG FUCKING SHARK COMES...
CAN I SAY THAT?
YOU CAN SAY IT, BUT WE CAN'T AIR IT.
SO THIS BIG DARN SHARK COMES ALONG....
MY CODE 7.
-YOU WERE COMING HOME LAST NIGHT.
-I'M SORRY.
I HAD SOME BAD CHINESE.
YOU LOOK A LITTLE BANGED UP.
YOU LOOK A LITTLE KNOCKED UP.
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU SURE?
EASY, TIGER!
THERE HE GOES AGAIN.
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN.
YOU OKAY?
I'M BETTER THAN ROGER.
HIS BOAT SANK.
-BOAT SANK?
-I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
NO! NO GREASE!
-HAVE SOME COOKIES.
-WHAT HAPPENED?
GUNFIGHTS, EXPLOSIONS, SHARKS.
THE USUAL.
HERE, BOY.
THANKS.
YOU WERE FISHING.
DOES TROUBLE GO LOOKING FOR YOU?
IT SEEMS TO KNOW PRETTY MUCH
WHERE I AM MOST OF THE TIME.
YOU FINISHED THE NURSERY.
YEAH, I DID.
IT'S GOOD FOR A GIRL OR BOY.
CUTE, HUH?
IT'S A DOGFEST!
DID YOU GET THE WHOLE 1 01 ?
I KNOW. I GOT A LITTLE
CARRIED AWAY WITH PUPPIES.
KID'LL PROBABLY HATE DOGS.
YOU KNOW, LORNA, WE NEVER
EVER TALKED ABOUT MARRIAGE.
I FIGURED YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT.
YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?
WELL, NO.
ME NEITHER.
BREAKFAST?
SERVE AND PROTECT.
SINCE WHEN DO YOU READ THIS SMUT?
IT'S NOT SMUT, IT'S EBONY CLARK.
TRISH GAVE IT TO ME.
"EVERY FIBER IN HIS BEING
DESIRED HER.
HE DEVOURED HER WITH HIS EYES. "
CAN WE TRY THIS THING
ON PAGE 1 96 SOMETIME?
THERE'S A GOOD ONE ON 1 68.
MAYBE LATER.
NOTHING COMES BETWEEN
A PREGNANT LADY AND A MEAL.
HAVE I EVER
"MADE YOUR WOMANHOOD REACH PEAKS...
...TO RIVAL THE HIMALAYAS"?
-FOOTHILLS OF MALIBU, MAYBE.
-NOT EVEN A TETON?
-I DON'T THINK SO.
-THANKS.
I THOUGHT I'D AT LEAST
RATE THE ROCKIES.
YOU KNOW I'M KIDDING.
-YOU SAY THAT TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
-NO, I DON'T.
YOU KNOW I'M PLAYING.
I'VE BEEN TO PLENTY OF
MOUNTAINTOPS WITH YOU.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M HUNGRY.
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KID,
WE'LL BLOW UP MOUNT SAINT HELENS.
-I BROUGHT YOU A DOUGHNUT.
-POLICE FOOD!
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
I DROPPED BY LNTERNAL AFFAIRS YESTERDAY.
HOW'S THE RAT SQUAD?
-I PICKED UP SOMETHING GOOD.
-SOME CHEESE?
I.A. GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP.
THE PERSON SAID ROGER'S ON THE TAKE.
NO, HE'S NOT.
I KNOW! IT'S PROBABLY
SOME JERK HE PUT AWAY.
BUT WITH NEW BOATS
AND PUTTING 2 KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE...
...I THOUGHT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.
I ACTUALLY TRIED TO
PERSUADE HIM TO TAKE MONEY.
STOP IT, RIGGS!
I CAN'T HEAR THAT! NOTHING!
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING ANYMORE.
I'M KIDDING.
-THAT'S AWFUL.
-I'M KIDDING.
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID IT.
WITH HIS PROBLEMS...
...HE'LL BLOW HIS TOP.
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE WHAT?
-IN GENERAL, PROBLEMS.
-YOU MEAN SOMETHING SPECIFIC.
I GOT A NOSE FOR THESE THINGS. WHAT?
YOU'RE PUSHING ME.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO THERE.
GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.
I WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE
TILL YOU TELL ME.
TELL ME.
I'LL TELL YOU!
PREGNANCY DESTROYED MY BRAIN CELLS!
WHAT? WHAT?
I'M DROOLING. WHAT?
PROMISE ME YOU'LL NEVER
SAY A WORD ABOUT THIS EVER.
-I SWEAR, I SWEAR.
-RIGHT HAND!
I SWEAR I WON'T, EVER.
I PROMISE. WHAT?
YOU KNOW HOW ROGER IS
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER DATING COPS.
HE'D KILL THEM. SO?
RIANNE MARRIED ONE, HER BABY'S FATHER.
SHE'S AFRAID TO TELL ROGER.
THEY MET, FELL IN LOVE.
SHE GOT PREGNANT, THEY GOT HITCHED.
NOBODY'S TELLING ROGER?
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN.
IT'S A PACKAGE DEAL?
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT?
-DOES TRISH KNOW?
-SHE KNOWS.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU KNOW.
BUT TRISH KNOWS.
WHO'S THE LUCKY SOON-TO-BE-DEAD
SON-IN-LAW?
-WHO?
-SERGEANT LEE BUTTERS.
THIS JUST GETS BETTER!
NO WONDER HE SUCKS UP TO ROG.
BRINGS HIM APPLES,
BLANKETS, COFFEE....
NOT A WORD.
I'M TELLING YOU, NOTHING!
I WON'T TELL. HE'D SHOOT ME
JUST FOR BEING THE MESSENGER.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. IT'D BE WRONG
TO MESS WITH HIM. I WON'T.
PROMISE.
WE DON'T HAVE TO DISCUSS BOYS' NAMES.
WE'RE HAVING A GIRL.
OKAY. PIADORA.
I LIKE PIADORA. THAT'S SWEET.
I LOVE THAT NAME.
WE'RE TALKING KIDS' NAMES.
HAS RIANNE PICKED ANY OUT?
WE DON'T WANT TO DOUBLE UP.
OSCAR FOR THE BOY,
LOREEN IF IT'S A GIRL.
I LIKE LEE BUTTER.
BETTER! I LIKE IT BETTER.
-DON'T GET ME STARTED.
-I LIKE THOSE NAMES.
CAPTAIN WANTS TO SEE US.
TRISH'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
HAVE FUN SHOPPING FOR THE BABY.
BYE-BYE, HONEY.
WHO HAD THE SLEEPOVER?
JUST AIRING OUT CAMPING GEAR.
-WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
-SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD.
REALLY GOOD!
TRISH HAS FOOD ON THE STOVE.
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
THAT SMELLS LIKE CHINESE FOOD.
CHINESE FOOD?
SHE'S INTO CHINESE COOKING.
I GOT TO TASTE THIS.
-I LOVE CHINESE FOOD.
-HOLD IT! PLEASE!
PLEASE!
THERE'S A CHINESE PERSON IN THE KITCHEN.
I SAW HIM.
A COUPLE OF CHINESE PEOPLE.
ACTUALLY A WHOLE FAMILY.
LARGE FAMILY.
HEY, GUYS!
-IT DOES SMELL GOOD.
-GREAT!
THEY HID IN THE LIFEBOAT.
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.
-SO YOU BROUGHT THEM HOME.
-IT TOOK TWO TRIPS.
-REALLY?
-THEY FIT IN THE STATION WAGON?
THAT'S PING WITH HIS GRANDFATHER, HONG.
HE'S HEAD OF THE FAMILY.
SPEAKS ENGLISH.
HONG, THIS IS MY PARTNER,
MARTIN RIGGS, AND LORNA.
WIFE?
CAN WE SPEAK?
LORNA, THIS IS THE BEST BREAKFAST.
I'M HUNGRY. I'D LOVE SOME.
THIS IS ILLEGAL.
AS IN, "AGAINST THE LAW".
YOU'LL BRING A SHITSTORM
DOWN ON YOU.
JUST HOLD ON!
JUST WAIT A FRIGGING MINUTE!
THE WAY I SEE IT,
THOSE ARE SLAVE SHIPS OUT THERE.
AND I'M FREEING SLAVES...
...IIKE NO ONE DID FOR MY ANCESTORS.
IT'S MY CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING
AND DO IT RIGHT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?
THIS WON'T BE BORING.
NEED ANY HELP?
WHERE IS HE?
WHAT THIS TIME,
FOOD OR MONEY?
-FOOD AND MONEY.
-MONEY.
I SEE YOU MORE
THAN WHEN YOU LIVED HERE.
WE'RE INDEPENDENT NOW.
WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?
-HOOKERS, DRUGS...
-CONTRACEPTIVES.
CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW
THEY TALK TO ME?
IT COSTS MORE TO GO TO SCHOOL NOW.
I GET THE TUITION BILLS.
AND THE GRADES TOO!
THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT
ON A FUTURE ASS-CHEWING.
GET OUT AND GO TO SCHOOL.
I SEE THE TUITION.
I WANT TO SEE SOME GRADES!
I WANT MORE CLUCK FOR MY BUCK.
THANKS FOR THE MONEY.
I'M TIRED.
ME, I CAN'T WIN.
BOY!
DID WE GET A RAISE
AND NOBODY TOLD ME?
I GOT TO GET TO THE BANK.
HOW CAN YOU WHEN YOU'RE TAKEN
TO THE CLEANERS ALL THE TIME?
HEY, GUYS.
HEY, TRISH!
-BOTH THE KIDS LEAVE?
-YES. AND WE'RE BROKE.
IS LORNA HERE?
SHE'S IN THE KITCHEN,
ON HER THIRD BREAKFAST.
I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS.
-I'M SORRY!
-I LOVE IT WHEN YOU DO THAT.
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.
WAIT TILL SHE TRIES RAISING
THAT BABY BY HERSELF.
I'LL BE FINE.
MOVE BACK IN AND GRANDPA'LL
BE UP NIGHTS WITH THE BABY.
BETTER THAN HER
MARRYING THE WRONG GUY.
A COP OR SOMETHING.
TRUE.
COME ON, GUYS.
SEE YOU.
I SHOULD SAY GOODBYE.
HURRY UP!
STUFFING YOUR FACE!
STOP KISSING ME.
TRY THAT.
STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRL.
I'M NOT JOKING.
STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRL.
-JOKING!
-GOT THE BABY BEEPER?
-I KNOW.
-IT'S YOUR FAULT.
IT'S YOUR FAULT.
ALL THE CHICKEN SHIT.
FLAPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY!
IT'S BEEN A YEAR ALMOST.
THIS SHIT AIN'T FUNNY NO MORE!
-ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
-PLEASE! ENOUGH!
I'M THE ONE THAT GETS IT IN THE NECK.
CAN WE EXERCISE MATURITY?
IF I FIND WHO'S DOING THIS,
I'LL KICK HIS ASS.
I CATCH THAT ASSHOLE WHO
PUT MY PICTURE UP, THAT'S IT!
-CUT THEIR BALLS OFF.
-CAPTAIN.
I LOOK OUT EXPECTING
TO SEE ALL THE OLD FACES.
INSTEAD, I SEE KIDS
WHOSE NAMES I BARELY REMEMBER.
WILL YOU SIT DOWN?
WE'RE DINOSAURS HEADED FOR EXTINCTION.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
WE'RE MAKING WAY FOR THE NEW POLICE:
GUYS WITH GUNS AND PSYCHOLOGY DEGREES,
LIKE BUTTERS OUT THERE.
BITER HAS A PSYCHOLOGY DEGREE?
-MORE LIKE A PSYCHO DEGREE.
-TIMES HAVE GOT TO CHANGE.
I ONCE GOT SHOT BY A HOT-RODDER
WITH A ZIP GUN.
THAT'S HOW FAR BACK I GO.
YOU WANTED TO SEE US?
SOME THINGS DON'T CHANGE.
-HERE WE GO.
-THE DEPARTMENT LOST ITS INSURANCE.
ALL THE DAMAGE YOU'VE DONE,
THEY CAN'T GET A NEW ONE...
...WHILE YOU TWO STILL RUN AROUND.
THEY CAN'T FIRE YOU EITHER.
SO, THEY'RE PROMOTING YOU.
-LIEUTENANT!
-THERE'S NO OPEN LIEUTENANT SPOTS.
SO THE CHIEF USED HIS SPECIAL PRIVILEGE,
MAKING YOU CAPTAINS.
-BETTER.
-CAPTAIN!
TIME WAS WHEN THIS WOULD SEND ME OVER
THE FALLS. I'M GETTING OLD.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
CAPTAIN SHIT!
-HANG OUT.
-TAKE LONG LUNCHES.
YELL, "RIGGS, MURTAUGH,
I'M THE CAPTAIN. "
"CHIEF'S SHITTING BRICKS! "
YOU FINISHED?
CAN YOU STAY OUT OF TROUBLE?
ABSOLUTELY.
-CAPTAIN RIGGS!
-CAPTAIN MURTAUGH!
YOU WANT YOUR BADGES?
LET ME SEE THOSE SERGEANT BADGES.
THROW THEM OVER HERE.
THIS IS THE MOST PAINFUL
EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.
-NOW GET OUT!
-THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
ENOUGH WITH THE "CAPTAIN" SHIT!
GET OUT OF HERE!
AFTER YOU, CAPTAIN, I INSIST!
"O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN! "
-CAPTAINS OUTRAGEOUS!
-NEWS TRAVELS FAST.
GET A BREAK FROM REAL POLICE WORK.
PLAY GOLF, TENNIS....
THEY GOT BROWN RINGS
AROUND THEIR NOSES
NOW THAT YOU'RE CAPTAINS,
COME UP IN THE CHOPPER.
-NOT FOR ME.
-I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK.
-IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, CALL US.
-HE'S DOWN-TO-EARTH.
I'M SORRY.
CAN WE KNOCK THIS OFF?
THIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING.
THE MAN'S GOT FEELINGS, YOU KNOW?
CONGRATULATIONS.
LOOK AT YOU!
CAPTAIN MURTAUGH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS,
BUT YOU REALLY INSPIRE ME.
KEEP IT UP.
HOW'S IT GOING, BURTON?
-IT'S BUTTERS, CAPTAIN.
-I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
-KID REALLY LIKES YOU.
-I WISH HE'D CUT IT OUT.
HE LIKES ME?
LIKES ME?
YOU DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME...
...IIKES ME LIKE THAT?
IT'S THE POLICE,
NOT THE MILITARY.
THE MILLENNIUM'S UPON US.
THE CAPTAIN SAID:
"NEW PEOPLE, NEW DEPARTMENT. "
DR. WOODS?
CAPTAIN RIGGS.
-DON'T RUN.
-I'M IN A RUSH.
-I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
-WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?
RECURRING DREAMS ABOUT FLYING DWARFS?
-OR DID YOU COOK UP SOMETHING NEW?
-I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THAT.
I WANT YOUR ADVICE.
I WAS THINKING OF...
-THINKING?
-MARRIAGE.
MARRIAGE?! THE "M" WORD?
DOES "CONFIDENTIALITY" MEAN ANYTHING?
THAT'S FUNNY.
YOU KNOW WHAT'D HAPPEN?
WE'D GO IN MY OFFICE...
...AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'D TELL ME?
YOU'D TELL ME SOMETHING LIKE, "DOC...
...I WANT TO MARRY MURTAUGH. "
OR YOUR MOTHER.
OR NELSON MANDELA!
NELSON MANDELA?!
SOMETHING TO RIDICULE ME, RIGGS.
SOMETHING TO GET A RISE OUT OF ME.
LISTEN CAREFULLY!
I'M...NOT...STUPID!
AND MY TIME IS RESERVED...
...FOR POLICE OFFICERS WITH
REAL NEEDS AND REAL PROBLEMS.
HAVE YOU GOT THAT?!
-HAVE YOU?!
-ASK ME AGAIN?
NO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T LIKE YOU.
STEPHANIE?
I CAN'T GO OUT WITH YOU.
I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP.
I THINK YOU NEED TO SEE SOMEONE.
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU.
NOT IN THIS DEPARTMENT.
BUT STOP BOTHERING ME!
YOU'RE DISGUSTING!
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE?!
WHAT'S SHAKING?
-CAPTAIN RIGGS.
-CAPTAIN MURTAUGH.
TURN AROUND AND DO THAT.
WE'RE CAPTAINS.
HEARD YOU WERE UP TO YOUR ASS
IN CHINESE.
THE TALLER ONES COME UP TO THE NAVEL.
BIG ENOUGH TO KICK YOUR ASS.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
ONE OF THE SHIP'S CREW SHOT AN ILLEGAL,
APPARENTLY UNDER ORDERS...
...AND WE'D DEARLY LIKE TO KNOW
WHO'S SMUGGLING CHINESE.
WE'RE PRETTY SURE THE BIG BOSS
IS BENNY CHAN.
UNCLE BENNY?
YOU KNOW HIM?
-WHEN HE WAS RUNNING SMACK.
-WE NEVER NAILED HIM.
BENNY'S SLIPPERY.
WHERE'S HE HANG OUT?
HE'S GOT A NIGHTCLUB,
SOME RESTAURANTS.
HE OPERATES MAINLY OUT ON NORTH
BROADWAY. HERE'S THE ADDRESS.
HI, FELLAS.
THERE HE IS.
HEY, BURGER! SUMMERS.
BUTTERS.
WHAT YOU GOT ON THE FREIGHTER HOMICIDE?
I TALKED TO SOME ILLEGALS.
THEY ONLY KNEW THE SHOOTER BY SIGHT.
THE BOAT'S REGISTERED UNDER
A DUMMY CORPORATION OUT OF LNDONESIA.
IT'LL BE A ROUGH ONE TO CRACK,
BUT WE'LL NAIL THEM.
YOU EVER HEAR OF BENNY CHAN?
NO. WHAT KIND OF BAD MAN IS HE?
REAL BAD.
CRIME BOSS IN CHINATOWN.
IF IT'S DIRTY AND CHINESE,
BENNY'S DOING IT.
WHERE DO I FIND HIM?
AT THIS RESTAURANT.
I'M HUNGRY FOR CHINESE.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
WE'RE GOING THERE ANYWAY.
WE'LL DRIVE YOU.
LET ME GET MY JACKET.
-NOT WITH HIM.
-HE'S DOING GOOD.
WE MIGHT NEED BACKUP.
SPEND TIME WITH HIM.
YOU MIGHT LEARN TO LOVE HIM.
LIKE A SON.
IN LAW...
...ENFORCEMENT IT PAYS TO KNOW
YOUR FELLOW OFFICER.
SIR, IT'LL BE AN HONOR
TO SHARE EGG ROLLS WITH YOU.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
SHARE?
BUTTERS, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HATE CRIME
IN A SORT OF PERSONAL WAY.
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT, SIR?
LAST NIGHT I NOTICED YOU WERE
MORE THAN SLIGHTLY MIFFED.
WASN'T HE, ROGER?
ANY PARTICULAR REASON?
ABOUT 1 50,000 OF THEM.
THAT'S HOW MANY BULLETS ZINGED
MY NEIGHBORHOOD GROWING UP.
COULDN'T GO OUTSIDE.
COULDN'T GO NEAR A WINDOW.
LIVED AND ATE ON THE FLOOR,
SLEPT AND WATCHED TV ON THE FLOOR.
I DIDN'T LEARN TO WALK
TILL I WAS 1 0.
SPENT MY FORMATIVE YEARS
NOSE-TO-NOSE WITH THE FAMILY BEAGLE.
WHEN I WORK ON A CRIME,
I AIN'T THINKING ABOUT THE CRIME.
I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT FLOOR
AND IT PISSES ME OFF.
-WE SUPPOSED TO MEET LEO SOMEWHERE?
-NO, WHY?
BECAUSE HE'S FOLLOWING US.
DON'T LOOK.
-WHO'S LEO?
-MAYBE IT'S A COINCIDENCE.
-WHAT DOES HE WANT?
-I DON'T KNOW. LET'S FIND OUT.
-FUCKING ASSHOLE!
-BITE ME!
WHATEVER! WHATEVER!
JERK!
YOU LOOKING FOR US?
-YOU SAW ME?
-YEAH, WE SAW YOU.
WHAT YOU DOING, LEO?
I'M PERFECTING MY TAILING TECHNIQUE
NOW THAT I'M A P.I.
HE'S A PRIVATE EYESORE.
INCONSPICUOUS VEHICLE! I LIKE IT.
RIGGS, WHO'S THE PERP?
-WHAT'D YOU BUST HIM FOR?
-I'M A PERP?
A BROTHER IN A POLICE CAR
IS AUTOMATICALLY A PERP?
LOOK AT MY SUIT!
DO I LOOK LIKE THE CRIPS' ACCOUNTANT?
LOOK AT THIS BADGE, BITCH!
CHECK OUT THE GUN.
PUT THE GUN DOWN!
LICENSE! REGISTRATION!
URINE SAMPLE!
I GOT A BADGE TOO!
GERMAN JEWS DIDN'T HAVE IT
EASY AS KIDS!
SO DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.
I KNEW YOU WERE A COP.
I WAS KIDDING.
I CAN SMELL A COP A MILE AWAY.
YOU SAYING I SMELL BAD?
DON'T TURN EVERYTHING AROUND!
YOU'RE SO TOUCHY.
THESE GUYS'LL TELL YOU.
WE GOT A HISTORY TOGETHER.
MAYBE WE'LL WORK TOGETHER SOMEDAY!
I'M THE BOMB!
WE'LL WORK TOGETHER WHEN I OPEN
A CEREAL SHOP, YOU LEPRECHAUN!
I DIDN'T CALL YOU NAMES, FUCKFACE!
DON'T START!
DON'T FOOL AROUND!
-THESE GUYS'LL TELL YOU.
-YOU'RE DOUBLE-PARKED.
OFFICER, I'M JUST TALKING
WITH THE DETECTIVES.
WE DON'T KNOW THIS GUY.
THINK HE WAS DRINKING.
THEY'RE KIDDING.
COME BACK!
I WASN'T DRINKING!
THEY JUST SAID THAT.
BLOW YOUR BREATH IN MY HAND.
I CAN SMELL IT ALREADY.
BLOW IN MY FUCKING EAR!
YOU'RE ALL MINE.
YOU'RE MINE!
YOU PROMISED TO DELIVER THE FAMILY.
THEY'RE NOT AT THE DETENTION CENTER.
THEY MUST HAVE ESCAPED.
THE UNCLE WON'T FINISH UNTIL
HE SEES THEM.
DON'T WORRY, THEY'LL TURN UP.
IN HONG KONG, YOU'D ALREADY BE DEAD.
WHERE'S UNCLE BENNY?
-HE'S NOT HERE.
-IS HE IN THERE?
-I'M SURE HE IS.
-THIS WAY.
YES, IT'S A TWO-WAY.
WE HAVE 3 PEOPLE.
THE RESTAURANT'S OVER THERE.
GO THIS WAY, PLEASE.
THEY SEE US,
BUT WE CAN'T SEE THEM.
-WHERE'S YOUR GREEN CARD?
-THAT'S A RACIST REMARK.
I'M A POLICEMAN
WHO ASKED FOR YOUR GREEN CARD!
THIS IS NOT THE WAY.
YOU'RE THE BOSS
TILL WE GET UP IN HIS ASS.
IT'LL BE FINE.
THEY'VE REFURBISHED!
I COULDN'T STOP THEM.
-OUT, OUT!
-CAN I GET DRINK OR FOOD?
UNCLE BENNY!
I HOPE THIS IS A BAD TIME.
-HE STILL HAS UNCLIPPED EYEBROWS.
-WHAT'D WE TELL YOU?
-WE HATE NOT DISTURBING YOU.
-THIS IS DETECTIVE BUCKLES.
SELL ANY HEROIN? KILL ANYONE LATELY?
HOW'S THE RESTAURANT?
EAT SOMETHING.
GIVE YOU THE POLICE DISCOUNT.
FLIED LICE?
IT IS FRIED RICE, YOU PLICK!
I'M BUSY.
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?
TELL HIM, BUTTKISS.
KNOW ABOUT A BOATLOAD OF
ILLEGALS THAT WENT AGROUND?
JUST WHAT I SAW ON THE NEWS.
SOMEONE LOST BIG MONEY.
AND MISSED MAKING THEM SLAVES.
YOU ARE COPS.
SMUGGLING CHINESE IS AN INS PROBLEM.
WE FOUND 3 BODIES FULL OF HOLES,
SO NOW IT'S A COP PROBLEM.
THREE DEAD CHINESE?
-BILLION MORE WHERE THEY CAME FROM.
-YES, LIFE'S CHEAP.
BUT HE SHOT AT US TOO.
THAT PISSES US OFF.
TOO BAD THEY MISSED.
BUT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT.
WHO'S HE?
HE LOOKS UNHAPPY.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
WHO'S THIS GUY?
IS HE JUST APPRAISING YOUR FURNITURE?
HE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.
THEN HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WORDS LIKE "SCUMBAG"...
... "EAT SHIT"?
I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS GOOD.
-ENTER THE DRAG QUEEN.
-THE INSURANCE, REMEMBER?
IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ON ME,
GET OUT.
WE'RE STILL AROUND.
I'M ON YOUR ASS TOO.
BUT THE DOOR IS THIS WAY!
THIS IS QUICKER.
THIS IS QUICKER, REALLY.
SEE? IT'S QUICKER!
DON'T FORGET MY
YOU IN HONG KONG,
YOU'D BE DEAD.
NO, NOT THAT!
RIGGS! DON'T!
THE INSURANCE....
WHAT THE HELL?
HURRY UP!
TRY IT SOMETIME.
IT'S SATISFYING AND THERAPEUTIC.
-SAVES THE COST OF SHRINKS.
-BAD GUYS CAN'T CALL THE COPS.
-WHY NOT? WE'RE ALREADY HERE!
-EI NI O!
I KNOW THIS GUY.
THAT'S THE CAPTAIN.
HOLD IT!

THEY LOVE WHEN YOU GET CUT OFF.
YOU KNOW WHY?
WHEN YOU CALL BACK...
...THEY CHARGE YOU FOR THE FIRST
MINUTE AGAIN AT THAT HIGH RATE.
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO CALL BACK...

IT'S HOW THEY KNOW WHERE I LIVE.
THERE'S THE SON OF A BITCH RIGHT THERE!

WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY.
JUST DON'T EXPECT ME TO LIKE IT.
I KNOW THIS MUST BE HARD FOR YOU.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME!
I HOPED WE'D GET TOGETHER
FOR THE HOLIDAYS, SAY CHRISTMAS.
WHY SHOULD WE GET TOGETHER

WE WENT THROUGH THAT.
WE'RE GOING THROUGH IT AGAIN.
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.
THESE LOOK VERY INTERESTING.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT.
YOU WON'T SHOOT ME.
-YOU'RE LOUSY COPS.

WHY'D YOU CALL HIM MY SON-IN-LAW?
UNCLE BENNY? HE'S TOO OLD.

AT FOUR FATHERS' STORE.
WHY'S HE TALKING ABOUT HIS ANCESTORS?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY YOU CALL HIM MY SON-IN-LAW?
BECAUSE I AM!
I THOUGHT HE WAS....
NO, I'M....
BLOODY MARVELOUS!
YOUR BABY IS HAVING MY BABY.
MY BABY IS HAVING HIS BABY.
AND YOUR BABY? WHOA, BABY!

TAKE THEM TO THEIR NEW HOMES...
...AND GUARANTEE THEIR SAFETY.
THEN I'LL FINISH.
FINISH NOW OR WATCH THE OTHERS DIE.
RIMMINY ?

I CAN 'T REMEMBER.
NO, RIGGS. RENMINBI.
SAY THAT AGAIN.
THAT'S IT!

MEANS, "PEOPLE'S MONEY. "
PEOPLE'S MONEY?
WHAT ELSE DID BENNY SAY?
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
BUYING BACK HIS ANCESTORS.
AND ABOUT HOW TONIGHT'S...
...TOO LATE.
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
NO, NOTHING AT ALL.
AND THE GUY WHO TORCHED MY HOUSE?
BENNY WAS AFRAID OF HIM.
IF BENNY'S SCARED,
HE'S GOT TO BE A CHINESE TRIAD.
THOSE GUYS KILL ANYONE
IN THEIR WAY.
INCLUDING COPS...
...AND THEIR FAMILIES.
WATCH YOUR ASSES!
-THANKS, NG.
-KEEP ME POSTED.
PICK UP YOUR WIFE, MY DAUGHTER.
-I'LL GET TRISH, YOU GET LORNA.

YES. YES, I DO.
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, IT'S OKAY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT
ANY PRESSURE ON YOU.
IF YOU WANT TO SOMEDAY, THAT'D BE GREAT.
IF YOU DON'T...

THEY FOUND MY WATCH.
THEY KILLED HONG, HIS UNCLE,
UNCLE BENNY TOO. BODIES ARE IN THERE.
-WHERE'S THE REST OF THE FAMILY?
-THEY'RE OKAY.
INS RAIDED A CHINESE SWEATSHOP.
HONG'S FAMILY WAS BEING HELD THERE
AND THEY LED THEM BACK HERE.
THEY WERE MAKING FUNNY MONEY.
INK'S STILL WET.
-WHERE ARE THE FACES?
-IT'S WHY I CALL IT FUNNY.
WHY ARE THEY MAKING CHINESE MONEY?
CAN THEY EVEN EXCHANGE IT HERE?
-ONLY IN CHINA.
-RENMINBI.
I REMEMBER.
HONG'S UNCLE WAS AN ARTIST.
MAYBE AN ENGRAVER.
BRINGING OVER HIS FAMILY COULD'VE
BEEN HOW HE WAS PAID FOR THE JOB.
-THAT'S THIN.
-IT'S NOT.
KEEP TALKING. WHAT?
BENNY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT PAYING...
...BUYING BACK HIS FOREFATHERS.
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
BENNY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT BUYING
BACK HIS FOREFATHERS.
YOU SAID ANCESTORS.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
THE NUMBER FOUR.
FOUR FATHERS.
THEY WERE THE TOP GUYS
OF THE HONG KONG TRIAD.
THEY DISAPPEARED FROM PRISON.
REDS JAILED THEM WHEN THEY

SON OF A BITCH WILL BE A HANDFUL.
SINCE I MET YOU, I'VE DONE SOME
HAIRY SHIT. BUT THIS WON'T HAPPEN.
I'M GOING TO BE A GRANDFATHER...
...AND YOU AND LORNA WILL HAVE A BABY.
HE AIN'T WORTH DYING FOR, RIGGS.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF HE GETS AWAY WE CAN
TRACK HIM DOWN LATER...
...WITH A HOWITZER OR SOMETHING.
YOUR SON-IN-LAW'S BLEEDING.
WE SHOULD GET HIM AND GO.
-SHIT, IT'S RAINING.
-I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT.
GUY'S TOO DAMN GOOD.
HOW'D HE DO THAT THING WITH THE GUN?
HE TOOK MY GUN APART WITH ONE MOVE.
HOW'D HE DO THAT?
HOW?
YEAH, OKAY.
LET'S GO ASK HIM.

YOU WANT TO GET YOURSELF SHOT?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS TAILING YOU.

I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.
I GUESS YOU WANT TO BE ALONE.
I'D APPRECIATE IT.
WHEN I WAS A KID I HAD A PET FROG.
WHAT?
GIVE ME A SECOND.
LET ME TELL YOU THIS.
I HAD THIS PET FROG, NAME WAS FROGGY.
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD.
I DIDN'T HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS.
IN FACT...
...I HAD NO FRIENDS.
I USED TO KISS THE FROG TOO.
I THOUGHT MAYBE...
...IT WOULD TURN INTO A PRINCESS
SINCE I WAS A BOY.
AND IT COULD BE...
...MY MOTHER.
THEY TOLD ME THAT
SHE LEFT OR SOMETHING.
AND MY FATHER WAS NO BARGAIN.
AND SO, JUST THE FROG...
...FROGGY, WAS MY FRIEND.
I LOVED HIM AND TOOK HIM
EVERYWHERE WITH ME.
I WAS RIDING MY BIKE ONE DAY...
...HE JUMPED OUT OF THE BOX...
...AND I RAN HIM OVER
WITH THE BACK TIRE.
I KILLED HIM.
I WAS REALLY HEARTBROKEN. REALLY.
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND,
THE ONLY THING I EVER LOVED.
AND THEN I MET YOU...
...AND ROGER.
YOU LOOKED AFTER ME
A LOT MORE THAN YOU HAD TO.
I'M TERRIBLE TO YOU, LEO.
NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE MY FAMILY...
...AND MY FRIENDS.
YOU'RE NOT BETTER FRIENDS THAN FROGGY,
JUST DIFFERENT.
I JUST THOUGHT THAT
MIGHT BE RELEVANT.
OKAY, I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE NOW.
I GOT A FUNNY F...
WHAT'S WRONG?!
I'M HAVING A BABY.
LORNA BEEPED ME.
YES, IT'S LORNA.
SHE'S HAVING THE BABY.
-I'LL GET THE CAR.
-I'LL BE BEHIND YOU.
YOU PICKED A STRANGE ANGEL, HONEY.
BUT I GOT THE MESSAGE.
I GOT THE MESSAGE.
I'LL ALWAYS HAVE THIS.
ALWAYS HAVE YOU.
IN HERE AND HERE.
THANKS, HONEY.
I GOT TO GO. BYE.
I AM NOT READY TO HAVE THIS BABY!
YOU'RE AS READY AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE.
FINE! JUST WHEEL ME IN.
MY LEGS ARE STAYING CLOSED!
GIVE ME THIS!
MA'AM, LET GO!
I AM A POLICE OFFICER!
AND I AM NOT READY!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
-ARE YOU THE HUSBAND?
-YES.
HONEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
NO, I'M NOT.
I SAID I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED, BUT I DO.
I WANT TO BE A WIFE
BEFORE I'M A MOTHER.
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO.
-YOU SAID "OKAY"?
-YES, I DID. OKAY.
LET'S DO IT.
HE SAID OKAY.
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-HE SAID OKAY, LEO.
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE TOILET
AND SHE GRABBED ME.
-I'M SO SORRY.
-HAVE A NICE BABY!
I'M SO SORRY.
WILL YOU MARRY ME?
YOU BET I WILL.
LET'S GO.
I'M NOT GOING! WAIT!
-GET A MINISTER.
-NOW?
NOW. WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE.
WE NEED A LICENSE...
I WANT TO HEAR IT
BEFORE THE BABY COMES!
IT'S COMING NOW.
LISTEN, I AM GETTING MARRIED
OR THERE IS NO BABY.
THIS COULD BE AN ASPECT
OF A TRANSITION PHASE.
THIS IS NO GODDAMN ASPECT
OF A TRANSITION PHASE!
HONEY, EVERYBODY, CALM DOWN.
CALM DOWN. OKAY?
GET A PRIEST, MINISTER, ANYTHING.
GO GET A PRIEST!
GODDAMN IT, LEO!
I GOT IT. OKAY.
PANT, PANT, BLOW.
REMEMBER LAMAZE CLASS?
PANT, BLOW. COME ON!
BUT I WANT TO SAY "I DO. "
HERE HE IS!
THIS IS RABBI GELB.
A RABBI?
YOU SAID ANYTHING.
HE'LL DO.
FOR WHAT I'LL DO?
WE'D LIKE YOU TO MARRY US.
PLEASE.
-YOU'RE JEWISH?
-NOT NECESSARILY.
-YOU GOT A LICENSE?
-NO.
PLEASE DON'T GO!
SHE NEEDS TO HEAR THE WORDS
BEFORE THE BABY COMES.
ARE YOU BOTH SERIOUS?
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR HIJINKS.
WE'RE VERY SERIOUS.
I COULD DO IT.
IT WOULDN'T BE OFFICIAL.
I JUST WANT TO HEAR THE WORDS.
WHAT THE HELL! YOUR NAMES?
I'M MARTIN AND THIS IS LORNA.
MARTIN AND LORNA.
WHAT AM I DOING?
HOW DO THE GOYIM DO THIS?
DEARLY BELOVED!
DEARLY BELOVED,
MARRIAGE IS A SPIRITUAL UNION....
FASTER!
SHE'S HEADING FOR THE HOME STRETCH.
MARTIN, WILL YOU TAKE
LORNA TO BE YOUR WIFE?
WILL YOU HONOR, LOVE, ETC...
-...TILL DEATH DO YOU PART?
-I WILL.
LORNA, WILL YOU TAKE MARTIN
TO BE YOUR HUSBAND?
-I DO.
-THE SAME THING.
I PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE.
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.
YOU ALREADY DID.
-LET'S GO.
-NO, WAIT!
HOLD IT!
WHAT IS IT?
LET ME HAVE THIS GLASS!
NO, GODDAMN IT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
TALK TO THE HAND!
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME
TO FILL THAT THING? ALL DAY!
THIS IS UNSANITARY.
WHAT IS THIS?
-BREAK THE GLASS.
-I'LL GET PISS ON MY SHOES!
YOU GOT TO DO THIS!
MAZEL TOV !
COME BACK HERE, YOU LITTLE SON OF A BITCH!
PANT, PANT, BLOW.
LEO, PLEASE.
YOUR WORK IS OVER HERE.
I THINK SOMEONE ELSE NEEDS YOU.
GOOD LUCK, LORNA, RIGGS.
THANKS A LOT.
STICK AROUND.
MEET THE KID.
GOOD LUCK, LORNA!
HERE IT COMES.
HERE HE IS.
HE'S LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU.
HE KNOWS IT'S YOU.
ROG, LOOK WHAT I FOUND.
-LOOK AT THAT.
-WHAT A BEAUTY!
LOOK AT THOSE EYES!
-HE LOOKS LIKE HIS MOTHER.
-YES, HE DOES.
MURTAUGH!
NO, BUTTERS!
BUTTERS' BABY.
BETTER NOT BE MURTAUGH.
IT'S BUTTERS.
LOOK AT THAT BABY.
LOOK AT THE HAIR.
THAT'S MY BABY!
LOOK AT HER. YOU'RE SO CUTE.
LOOK AT YOU!
OF BRINGING A CAMERA?
LEO, YOUR PLASTIC'S FLACCID.
THESE MACHINES WRECK YOUR PLASTIC,
THEN GIVE YOU THE CAMERA.
THE CAMERA DOESN'T WORK.
THEY'RE TRYING TO...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
LOOK AT THESE TWO BABIES.
A LITTLE SOMETHING FROM THE SQUAD.
-GIVE BACK THE CAPTAIN BADGES.
-WHY?
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE SERGEANTS AGAIN.
THE CITY'S SELF-INSURED.
I THOUGHT THEY'D MAKE US PRESIDENT.
BY THE WAY, GRANDPA,
YOU OWE THE CHIEF ONE.
HE WENT TO THE INS...
...AND THEY'RE GIVING ASYLUM
TO THE HONGS.
ALL RIGHT!
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A PICTURE.
SQUEEZE TOGETHER.
CANDY STRIPERS OUT.
OUT! OKAY. OUT!
I CAN'T.
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM.
YOU GOT TO BACK UP.
I'M TAKING BIG STEPS!
GET THIS GUY TO TAKE IT.
DOC, CAN YOU TAKE A PICTURE
OF ALL OF US?
IT'S MY BEST MAN, AFTER ALL.
GET MY GRANDBABY IN IT TOO.
ARE YOU ALL FRIENDS?
NO. WE'RE FAMILY!
OKAY, ON 3.
ONE, TWO, THREE!

                             BY SHANE BLACK




     FADE IN:

     CITY OF ANGELS

     LIES SPREAD OUT BENEATH US IN ALL ITS  SPLENDOR,  LIKE  A
     BARGAIN BASEMENT PROMISED LAND.

     CAMERA SOARS, DIPS, WINDS ITS WAY SLOWLY  DOWN,  DOWN,
     BRINGING US IN OVER THE CITY AS WE:

     SUPER MAIN TITLES.

     TITLES END, AS WE --

     SPIRAL DOWN TOWARD A LUSH, HIGH-RISE APARTMENT COMPLEX.
     THE MOON REFLECTED IN GLASS.

     CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE IN THROUGH BILLOWING CURTAINS,
     INTO THE INNER SANCTUM OF A  PENTHOUSE  APARTMENT,  AND
     HERE, BOYS AND GIRLS, IS WHERE WE LOSE OUR BREATH,
     BECAUSE --

     SPREAD-EAGLED ON A SUMPTUOUS DESIGNER SOFA LIES THE
     SINGLE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE CITY.
     BLONDE HAIR. A SATIN NIGHTGOWN THAT POSITIVELY  GLOWS.
     SAM COOKE MUSIC, CROONING FROM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR
     SPEAKERS.

     PASTEL COLORS. WINDOW  WALLS.  NEW  WAVE  FURNITURE  TOR-
     TURED INTO WEIRD SHAPES.  IT LOOKS LIKE ROBOTS LIVE HERE.

     ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE SLEEPING VENUS  LIES  AN  OPEN
     BOTTLE OF PILLS ... NEXT TO THAT, A MIRROR DUSTED WITH
     COCAINE.

     SHE ROUSES HERSELF TO SMEAR SOME POWDER  ON  HER  GUMS.
     AS SHE DOES, WE SEE FROM HER EYES THAT SHE IS THOROUGHLY,
     COMPLETELY WHACKED OUT OF HER MIND...

     SHE STANDS, STUMBLES ACROSS THE ROOM, PAUSING TO GLANCE
     AT A PHOTOGRAPH ON THE WALL:

     TWO MEN.  SOLDIERS.  YOUNG, ROUGH-HEWN, ARMS AROUND EACH
     OTHER.

     THE GIRL THROWS OPEN THE GLASS DOORS ... STEPS OUT ONTO A
     BALCONY, AND THERE, BENEATH HER, LIES  ALL  OF  NIGHTTIME
     L.A.  PANORAMIC SPLENDOR.  HER HAIR FLIES, HER EXPRESSION.
     RAPT, AS SHE STANDS AGAINST THIS SEA OF TECHNOLOGY.  SHE
     IS BEAUTIFUL.

     ON THE BALCONY RAILING BESIDE HER  STAND  THREE  POTTED
     PLANTS.

     THE GIRL SEES THEM, PICKS ONE UP.  LOOKS OVER THE BALCONY
     RAILING ... IT IS TEN STORIES DOWN TO THE PARKING LOT.
     SHE SQUINTS, HOLDS THE PLANT OVER THE EDGE.

                         GIRL
               RED CAR.

     DROPS THE PLANT.  DOWN IT GOES, SPIRALLING END OVER END
     -- UNTIL, FINALLY ... BAM --  !  SHATTERS.  DIRT  FLIES.  A
     RED CHEVY IS NOW MINUS A WINDSHIELD.  THE GIRL TAKES
     ANOTHER PLANT.

                         GIRL
               GREEN CAR.

     SHE DROPS IT.  GREEN DODGE.  TEN STORIES BELOW, BAM
     IMPACT CITY.  SCRATCH ONE PAINT JOB.  GRABS THE FINAL
     PLANT AND HOLDS IT OUT, SAYING:

                         GIRL
               BLUE CAR.

     POW.  GLASS SHATTERS.  DIRT SPRAYS.  A BLUE BMW THIS
     TIME.  THE GIRL LOVES THIS GAME ... HER EXPRESSION IS
     SLIGHTLY CRAZED.  SHE REACHES FOR ANOTHER PLANT --
     THERE AREN'T ANY.  HER SMILE FADES -- AND FOR A MOMENT,
     JUST A MOMENT, THE DULLNESS LEAVES HER EYES AND SHE IS
     SUDDENLY, INCREDIBLY SOBER.  AND TEARS FILL HER EYES AS
     SHE LOOKS OVER THE EDGE --

                         GIRL
               YELLOW CAR.

     AND JUMPS THE RAILING. PLUMMETS, HEAD  OVER  HEELS  LIKE  A
     RAG DOLL. HITS THE YELLOW CAR  SPOT  ON.  SHE  LIES,  DEAD,
     LIKE AN EXTINGUISHED DREAM.  STILL BEAUTIFUL.

                                                  CUT TO:

1A   EXT. BENEATH THE PIER    NIGHT                         1A

     FOUR TOUGH-LOOKING DOCK WORKERS ARE CAMPED  OUT  UNDER  THE
     PIER, WARMING THEMSELVES AROUND A SMALL BONFIRE, LAUGHING
     LOUDLY.  CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS DANGLE ABOVE THEM FROM THE
     PIER, AND EMPTY BEER CANS LITTER THE SAND AROUND THEM.

     CAMERA PUSHES IN TO DISCOVER AN OLD COLLIE TIED TO ONE OF
     THE PILINGS. THEN WE REALIZE THAT THE  DOG  IS  BEING  TOR-
     MENTED BY THE DOCK WORKERS.  THEY FLICK LIGHTED MATCHES
     AT HIM.  SHAKE THEIR BEERS AND SPRAY HIM IN THE FACE.
     THESE GUYS ARE NOT ROCKET SCIENTISTS.

     THE DOG COWERS, TUGGING BN THE ROPE.  TRIES  TO  GET  AWAY.
     ALL TO THE GREAT AMUSEMENT OF ITS TORMENTORS.

     ONE OF THEM TURNS, LAUGHING --

     AS A SHADOWY FIGURE STRIDES CALMLY UP TO THE FIRE:
     LONG HAIR.
     CIGARETTE DANGLING FROM-LOWER LIP.
     SHIRT-TAILS HANGING LOOSE BELOW THE WAIST.

     NOTHING THREATENING IN HIS MANNER AS HE PLOPS DOWN  BESIDE
     THE MEN, SMILING.
     THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY ON THEIR GUARD.

                         RIGGS (FIGURE)
               HAPPY HOLIDAYS.  MIND IF I JOIN
               YOU?

                         PUNK  #1
               YES.

                         PUNK  #2
               FUCK OFF.

     RIGGS SMILES AT HIM INNOCENTLY.  STROKES THE COLLIE'S FUR
     WITH ONE HAND.
     WITH THE OTHER, HE REACHES INTB A PAPER SACK AND PRODUCES,
     A SPANKING NEW BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS, POSSIBLY THE FINEST
     DRINK MANKIND HAS  YET  PRODUCED.

                         RIGGS
               I NEED HELP DRINKING THIS.  COOL?

     THE DOCK WORKERS EXCHANGE GLANCES.  THERE SEEMS TO BE NO
     HARM IN THIS.  ONE OF THEM FROWNS:

                         PUNK  #1
               YOU A HOMO?

                         RIGGS
               DO I LOOK LIKE A HOMO?

                         PUNK  #1
               YOU GOT LONG HAIR.  HOMOS GOT LONG
               HAIR.

                         PUNK #3
               I HATE HOMOS.  ARRGGH.

     RIGGS SHAKES HIS HEAD, LAUGHS.

                         RIGGS
               BOY, YOU GUYS ARE TERRIFIC.  YOU
               MAKE ME LAUGH, YOU JUST DO.

     AT WHICH POINT, APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH, PUNK #4 SHAKES A
     BEER AND SPRAYS IT IN THE OLD COLLIE'S FACE.

     THE DOG PULLS  AWAY,  WHINING.
     RIGGS LEANS FORWARD.

                         RIGGS
               THIS YOUR DOG?  NICE DOG.

     AND THEN, HE PROCEEDS TO DO A PECULIAR THING:
     HE STARTS TO TALK TO THE DOG --
     IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE DOG'S OWN LANGUAGE.
     VERY WEIRD, FOLKS...
     HE COOS, SNUFFLES, BARKS SOFTLY, THEN WITHDRAWS,
     LISTENING, HIS EAR TO THE DOG'S MUZZLE.
     RIGGS NODS.  FROWNS.
     THE OTHERS LOOK  ON,  PUZZLED.
     THEN RIGGS LOOKS AT EACH OF THE FOUR DOCK WORKERS.

                         RIGGS
               HUH-  YOU KNOW WHAT?  HE SAYS HE
               DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SPRAY BEER IN
               HIS FACE.  HE SAYS HE JUST HATES
               THAT.

     A PAUSE.  UNCOMFORTABLE.  THEN --

                         PUNK #1
               OH, HE DOES ... ?
                    (BEAT)
               WELL, MISTER, WHY DON'T YOU ASK
               HIM WHAT HE LIKES...?

     THE OTHERS SNICKER.  RIGGS SIMPLY NODS.

                         RIGGS
               OKAY.

     AND ONCE AGAIN, BEGINS TO CONFER WITH THE DOG.  LISTENS
     INTENTLY, PIECING TOGETHER WHAT HE IS HEARING.

                         RIGGS
               WHAT ... ? YOU WANT ...  OH.  OH,
               HELL NO, I COULDN'T DO  THAT  ...
               NOSSIRREE BOB,  YOU  LITTLE  NUT.

     HE RUFFLES THE DOG'S HAIR.
     THE MEN ARE MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER AS RIGGS TURNS AND
     SAYS:

                         RIGGS
                    (CHUCKLING)
               GET THIS: HE WANTS  ME  TO  BEAT
               THE SHIT OUT OF YOU GUYS.

     EVERYTHING STOPS.  A CLOUD PASSES OVER THE ASSEMBLED
     FACES AND A  PIN-DROPPING  SILENCE  ENSUES.

     RIGGS, COMPLETELY HEEDLESS, ONCE AGAIN ATTENDS TO THE DOG:

                         RIGGS
               WHAT'S THAT ... ?  THE ONE ... IN THE
               MIDDLE...  'IS A STUPID FAT DUCK'...
               WHAT ... ?
                    (LISTENS AGAIN)
               OH ... OH!  A 'STUPID FAT FUCK!'
               RIGHT.

     HE LOOKS UP, SHAKES HIS HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               BOY, THIS DOG IS PISSED.

     THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE GRABS RIGGS BY THE COLLAR.
     HOISTS HIM TO HIS FEET.  GULP.

     STANDS, STARING DOWN AT RIGGS, WHOSE EYES ARE COMPLETELY
     NEUTRAL, LIKE A SNAKE'S.

                         PUNK #1
               BUDDY, YOU'RE SHORTENING YOUR
               LIFE SPAN.

     HE FLICKS OPEN A MEAN-LOOKING SWITCHBLADE.

     RIGGS IS DEAD MEAT.

     SO WHY THEN, DOES HE CHOOSE THIS MOMENT TO EXECUTE A
     THREE STOOGES' ROUTINE, CONSISTING OF NOSE TWEAK, EYE
     GOUGE, AND ROTATING FIST THAT BOBS THE DOCK WORKER ON
     THE HEAD... ?

     HE'S NUTS OR SOMETHING ...

     RIGGS STEPS BACK AND ADOPTS A NEUTRAL FIGHTING STANCE.
     THE OTHERS BEGIN TO CIRCLE.

     THE DOG BARKS.  RIGGS TURNS TO THE DOG, BUT HIS EYES NEVER
     LEAVE HIS GRINNING ATTACKERS.

                         RIGGS
                    (TO THE COLLIE)
               WHAT'S THAT ... ?  YOU WANT ME TO
               TAKE THE KNIFE AWAY... AND BREAK
               HIS ELBOW... ?

     CIRCLING ...

     RIGGS, WATCHING THEM, HIS EYES BEGINNING TO DANCE ...
     BREATHING SLOW AND EVEN...

                         RIGGS
               BUT THAT WOULD BE EXCRUCIATINGLY
               PAINFUL ...

     SOMETHING INSIDE RIGGS IS GEARING UP ... THE OTHERS CAN
     PERHAPS SENSE IT, THEIR SMILES FALTER A BIT,  THEY  CROUCH,
     COMBAT-READY...
     RIGGS, EYES BLAZING ...

                         RIGGS
               AND IF I SEPARATED THE FAT ONE'S
               SHOULDER... HE'D PROBABLY SCREAM...

     NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.  WE KNOW FROM THE LOOK IN RIGGS' EYES
     HE'S NUTS.  HE WANTS THE FIGHT, BADLY, ALL FOUR OF THEM
     AT ONCE ...

     AND THEN PUNK #1 SPRINGS...
     BIG MISTAKE.

     NEEDLESS TO SAY, MINCEMEAT IS MADE OF THE  FOUR  MEDDLESOME
     DOG-TORTURERS.

     THE BEACH IS LITTERED WITH THEIR WRITHING FORMS AS RIGGS
     DOES, FINALLY, WHAT HE SET OUT TO DO:

     UNTIES THE DOG.

     STARTS TO GO.
     AS HE DOES, HE PATS HIS SHIRT ...

     PATS HIS JEANS ... REALIZES HIS WALLET HAS FLOWN FREE
     DURING THE FRACAS.

     SCOOPS TO RETRIEVE IT FROM ITS RESTING PLACE ON THE  SAND,

     WHERE IT LIES OPEN, AND AS IT LIES OPEN, YES,  FOLKS,  THAT
     IS A BADGE WE SEE.

     RIGGS, WE REALIZE, IS AN OFFICER OF THE LAW.

     HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE AND NOTICES THE COLLIE, SEATED.
     FROWNS:

                         RIGGS
               OKAY, SKEEZIX.  GO ON.  GET OUTTA
               HERE.

     HE BEGINS TO WALK AWAY.  THE DOG REMAINS CLOSE AT HIS
     HEELS.  FOLLOWING HIM.

                        RIGGS
               NO, NO.  DON'T FOLLOW ME.  I'M AN
               ASSHOLE.  GO AWAY.

     THE DOG SITS OBEDIENTLY AND RIGGS WALKS AWAY.
     HE CAN'T HELP IT, LOOKS BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER...

     SEES THE DOG WATCHING HIM WITH A BESEECHING EXPRESSION.
     PITIFUL.

                         RIGGS
               AW, SHIT.

     HE SIGNALS THE DOG.

                         RIGGS
               AWRIGHT.  MOVE IT.  LET'S GO.

     THE COLLIE BARKS HAPPILY AND DASHES TOWARD HIM THROUGH
     THE SURF, KICKING UP SAND AND WATER.

     AS THEY SHUFFLE OFF AGAINST THE PALM-LINED SKYLINE, WE
     HEAR, SUPERED, RIGGS' VOICE.

                         RIGGS (V.O.)
               SO.  YOU LIVE IN THE AREA?  WHAT'S
               YOUR MAJOR ... ?

     AND SO ON AS WE ...

                                            CUT TO:

     PALM TREES CAST SHADOWS  ON  THE  LAWN.  TOYS,  LOTS  OF  THEM,
     LITTERED ACROSS THE LAWN.  A BIG WHEEL, A G.I. JOE FIGURE.
     CHRISTMAS LIGHTS  ARE  STRUNG  ACROSS  THE  EAVES.


                                            CUT TO:

               GO FOR IT, HUH...?  OKAY, I'LL
               GO FOR IT.

     HE BLOWS OUT THE CANDLES.  APPLAUSE.  HIS   GAZE   LINGERS
     ON -- THE CAKE.  OR RATHER, THE MESSAGE SCRAWLED ATOP IT
     IN ICING:           WELCOME TO THE BIG 50

     THE PRESENTS ARRIVE.

9    EXT. SIMI VALLEY - MORNING                                    9

     THE SCORCHED LANDSCAPE STRETCHES OUT  BENEATH  A  LATTICE-
     WORK OF HIGH-TENSION POWER LINES.  ONLY SCRUB GRASS
     GROWS HERE. RUSTED RAILROAD TRACKS  WANDER  INTO  THE  DIS-
     TANCE, AND NESTLED BESIDE THEM, LIKE THE  LAST  STOP  BE-
     FORE DEATH -- SITS A LONELY  TRAILER  HOME.  BATTERED  TV
     ANTENNA.  A DIRT YARD WHICH HOUSES A BEAT-UP PICKUP
     TRUCK. DEAD GARDEN  SPROUTING  WEEDS.  THE  GROUND  BEGINS
     TO TREMBLE ... LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE, RATTLING THE POWER
     POLES, AS, WITHOUT WARNING -- AN  EXPRESS  TRAIN  BLASTS
     BY CAMEPA AND STREAKS PAST THE TRAILER  AT  SEVENTY  MILES
     AN HOUR.

10   INT. TRAILER HOME                                            10

     NOW WE ARE INSIDE, THE RUMBLING FAINTER ... AND  WE  ARE
     LOOKING AT A TIRED, CHISELED FACE.  ETCHED  WITH  LINE  AND
     SHADOW. EYES CLOSED, AS THE  SHADOWS  FROM  THE  SPEEDING
     TRAIN STROBE ACROSS DETECTIVE SERGEANT MARTIN RIGGS.
     MORNING IS NOT A GOOD TIME FOR  RIGGS.  THE  CLOCK  RADIO
     SUDDENLY BLARES TO LIFE:  "SILVER BELLLLS ... IT'S
     CHRISTMAS TIIIME IN THE CITY..."  RIGGS SNAPS AWAKE
     INSTANTLY.  ALERT.  TENSE.  FACE BATHED IN SWEAT.

11   ANOTHER ANGLE

     HE IS NOT ALONE.  IN THE DOORWAY SITS A THOROUGHLY
     LOVEABLE BLACK LABRADOR.  SITTING  STOCK  STILL.  STAR3.NG
     AT RIGGS, WATCHING HIM  SLEEP.  TAIL  GOING  THUMP-THUMP-
     THUMP ON THE CARPET.

     RIGGS SITS UP.  STARES AT THE DOG.

                         RIGGS
               SAM, TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY ...
               OF THE REST OF MY LIFE.

     HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE.  INHALES.
     COUGHS AND HACKS.

     THE TRAIN THROBS BY OUTSIDE, RATTLING HIS SKULL ...

                                            CUT TO:

12   INT. MURTAUGH HOME - SAME TIME                               12

     AND IT IS A TYPICAL MORNING FOR DETECTIVE ROGER MURTAUGH.
     CHAOS. THE  TELEVISION  BLARES.  YOUNG  CARRIE  MURTAUGH
     WAILS LIKE A BANSHEE.  HER BROTHER NICK TELLS HER TO
     SHUT UP. TRISH MURTAUGH IS BURNING  EGGS  IN  THE  KITCHEN.
     ROGER MURTAUGH ENTERS THEN, FIXING  HIS  TIE.  THE  FOLLOW-
     ING DIALOGUE IS FAST AND FURIOUS, TOSSED  OVER  THE  SHOUL-
     DER AS MURTAUGH SCURRIES TO AND FRO,  GETTING  DRESSED:

                         MURTAUGH
               HONEY, WHAT'S THIS ON MY TIE?

     SHE  LOOKS.

                         TRISH
               AN  UGLY   SPOT?

                         MURTAUGH
               THANKS.  SHARP AS A PIN.

                         TRISH
               I'M THINKING OF GOING ON 'JEOPARDY.'

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON COOKING.

                         TRISH
               THANKS.  I LOVE YOU, TOO.

     CARRIE IS STILL SHRIEKING.  TEARS STREAM DOWN HER FACE.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY, KID, TURN OFF THE WATERWORKS,

               DADDY, HE CHANGED THE CHANNEL!

                         MURTAUGH
               NOOOOOO.

                         NICK
               SHE'S A CRYBABY, DAD.

                         MURTAUGH
               MIND YOUR OWN BUSINES.
                    (NODS TOWARD THE TV)
               THAT'S  ILLEGAL.

                         NICK
               WHAT'S ILLEGAL?

                         MURTAUGH
               CAN'T PUT A DEAD BODY IN AN
               AMBULANCE.  THIS 'KOJAK'?

                         NICK
               'STARSKY AND  HUTCH.'

                         MURTAUGH
               HUH.  IT'S ILLEGAL.  NEVER PUT A
               DEAD BODY IN AN AMBULANCE, SON,
               YOU GOT THAT?

                         NICK
               SURE, DAD.

                        MURTAUGH
               HONEY, WHERE'S THE SPOT REMOVER?
                    (TURNS TO CARRIE)
               YOUNG LADY, STOP CRYING OR I'LL
               GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO CRY ABOUT.
               DAMN.

     HE DABS AT HIS TIE.  CARRIE SCREAMS.  IN THE KITCHEN
     TRISH DROPS THE EGGS, SWEARS.  THE PHONE RINGS.  CARRIE
     SCREAMS.

                         MURTAUGH
               THAT'S IT.  I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
               SOMETHING TO CRY ABOUT.

     HE GRABS A COPY  OF NEWSWEEK AND HANDS IT TO HER.

                         MURTAUGH
               STARVING CHILDREN.  SEE?  THEY
               HAVEN'T EATEN, IT'S VERY SAD.
               CRY.

     HE MOVES AWAY.

                         CARRIE
               DADDY, YOU'RE WEIRD ...

                         MURTAUGH
               THANK YOU, CARRIE.  HEAR THAT,
               HONEY, THE CHILDREN THINK I'M
               WEIRD.

                         TRISH
               THEY'RE BRIGHT CHILDREN.
                    (HANGS UP THE
                     TELEPHONE)
               HONEY, YOU KNOW A MAN NAMED DICK
               LLOYD?  DON'T STEP IN THE EGG.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHERE'S MY THINKING?  I SHOULD'VE
               CHECKED THE FLOOR FOR EGG.  DICK
               LLOYD ... ?
                    (BEAT)
               JESUS, DICK LLOYD.  WHAT'S HE WANT?

                         TRISH
               THE OFFICE CALLED.  HE'S BEEN
               TRYING TO REACH YOU FOR THREE DAYS
               NOW.

                         MURTAUGH
               I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM IN... SHIT,
               TWELVE YEARS?  NO, WAIT A MINUTE,
               THAT WOULD MAKE ME FIFTY YEARS OLD,
               THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

                         TRISH
                    (SMILES)
               YOU'RE NOT GETTING OLDER, YOU'RE
               GETTING BETTER.

                         MURTAUGH
               INFORM THE CHILDREN OF THIS.
                    (KISSES HER; HEADS
                     FOR THE DOOR)
               FORGET THE EGGS, I'LL EAT LATER.

                         TRISH
               WHATEVER.
                    (BEAT)
               HONEY?
                    (AS HE STOPS)
               HOW COME I NEVER HEARD OF DICK
               LLOYD?

                         MURTAUGH
               I NEVER TALKED ABOUT HIM.

                         TRISH
               OH.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  VIETNAM BUDDY.

     HE EXITS THE KITCHEN, CROSSES THE ENTRANCE HALL.  STOPS,
     NOTICING RICKLES THE CAT, WHO IS HAPPILY MUNCHING ON THE
     REMAINS OF ROGER'S BIRTHDAY CAKE.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY.

     HE SWATS IT ASIDE.  PAUSES, HIS GAZE LINGERING ON THE
     SILENT MESSAGE WHICH GNAWS AT HIS GUTS.

               THE BIG 50 ...

     HE COMES OUT THE FRONT DOOR.  FLICKS  OFF  THE  CHRISTMAS
     LIGHTS, CROSSES TO THE CAR. LOOKS UP,  AND  SEES  --  HIS
     OLDEST DAUGHTER RIANNE.  JOGGING PAST.  SHE WEARS AN
     ADORABLE PAIR OF DOLPHIN SHORTS.  WALKMAN HEADPHONES.
     SHE WAVES.

                         RIANNE
               'BYE, DADDY.

     HE WAVES.

                    (SHAKES HIS HEAD)
               GODDAMN HEARTBREAKER.  SHE'S A

     THE KIND YOU GET FROM KNIVES. RUNS A HAND  THROUGH  LIMP
     HAIR. TURNS ON THE LAMP. AS HE DOES  --  THE  TELEVISION
     ALSO SPRINGS TO LIFE; HOOKED TO THE SAME  CIRCUIT.  POPS
     THREE ASPIRIN FROM A BOTTLE.  CHEWS THEIN.
     OPENS A BAG OF PEANUTS, THROWS IT TO THE BIG LAB,  WHO
     GOBBLES THEM DOWN.
     EATS A SANDWICH, STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS APARTMENT.

     MURTAUGH ENTERS. SHEDS HIS COAT, UNHOLSTERS  THE  .38.
     STEPS TO THE RED LINE.  SHIFTS.  STRETCHES.  CRACKS  HIS
     NECK.  THIS IS A RITUAL FOR HIM.  HE STOPS TO EXAMINE HIS
     RIGHT HAND, HOLDING IT STEADY BEFORE HIS  EYES.  EXCEPT
     THERE IS A SLIGHT TREMBLE. TINY, BUT  IT'S  THERE.  HE
     FROWNS.  BRACES HIMSELF:  CROSS-DRAWS WITH LIGHTNING

               LLOYD.  AMANDA LLOYD.  YOU KNOW
               HER ... ?

     MURTAUGH LOOKS STUNNED.  HE SPEAKS VERY SLOWLY:

                         MURTAUGH
               I KNEW HER  DAD.

                         COP #2
               JESUS.
                    (AN AWKWARD PAUSE)
               VEHICLE IS REGISTERED TO HER.  SHE
               LANDED RIGHT ON TOP OF HER OWN CAR.

                         MURTAUGH
               FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT IT FOR HER.
               HER SUGAR DADDY.

                         COP #2
               TAKE SOME LOOKING INTO.

                         MURTAUGH
               SO LOOK.

19   INT. AMANDA LLOYD'S APARTMENT - DAY                          19

     MURTAUGH STARES AT THE PHOTOGRAPH WE SAW EARLIER.  THE
     TWO SOLDIERS.  ONE, WE CAN ASSUME, IS DICK LLOYD.  THE
     OTHER IS MURTAUGH.  YOUNGER, TRIMMER.  HE SPEAKS INTO
     THE PHONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               HELLO, HONEY ... ?  GIVE ME THE
               NUMBER FOR DICK LLOYD.  WHAT ... ?
               YES, THE MAN WHO CALLED ME THIS
               MORNING.  HIS DAUGHTER JUST TOOK
               A DIVE OUT A WINDOW.

19A  EXT. CHRISTMAS TREE LOT  -  DAY                              19A

     MARTIN RIGGS AND THREE LOT EMPLOYEES ARE GATHERED AROUND
     THE LIFTGATE OF A TRUCK BEARING A LOAD OF CHRISTMAS TREES.
     THE TRUCK SHIELDS THEM FROM THE VIEW OF CUSTOMERS PICKING
     OUT TREES IN THE LOT.

     THE LOT EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY DRUG DEALERS.  THEY LOOK
     AROUND NERVOUSLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS AS RIGGS TASTES A
     SAMPLE OF THEIR WARES.

                         RIGGS
               GOOD STUFF.

                         DRUG DEALER ONE
               YOU BETTER FUCKIN' BELIEVE IT.

                         RIGGS
               OKAY.  LET'S DO IT.  HOW MUCH?

                         DRUG DEALER TWO
               HOW MUCH FOR HOW MUCH?

                         RIGGS
               FOR ALL  OF  IT.

                         DRUG DEALER THREE
               YOU WANT IT ALL?

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.
                    (GLANCES AT
                     THE TREES)
               AND MAYBE A NICE BIG SIX-FOOTER
               TO PUT IT UNDER.

                         DRUG DEALER ONE
               THE TREE YOU CAN HAVE FOR NUTHIN'.
               BUT THE SHIT IS GONNA RUN YOU A
               HUNDRED.

     RIGGS LETS OUT A SOFT WHISTLE AT THE AMOUNT.

                         RIGGS
               THAT MUCH, HUH?
                    (DIGS INTO
                     HIS   POCKET)
               OKAY.  LET'S SEE WHAT I GOT.

     HE PULLS OUT A ROLL OF MONEY AND BEGINS TO COUNT IT OUT
     IN TWENTIES AND SMALL BILLS.

                         RIGGS
               TWENTY, FORTY, SIXTY --

     THE DRUG DEALERS EXCHANGE DUMBFOUNDED EXPRESSIONS.

                         DRUG DEALER ONE
               HEY, MAN.  HEY!

                         RIGGS
               WAIT, WAIT ... SHUTUP.  I'M
               LOSIN  COUNT.  WHERE  WAS  I?   OH,
               YEAH...
                    (CONTINUES   TO
                     PEEL  OFF  THE
                     BILLS)
               ... EIGHT,   NINETY,   NINETY-FIVE,
               NINETY-SIX, NINETY-SEVEN...
                    (DIGS INTO HIS
                     POCKET FOR
                     LOOSE CHANGE)
               ... NINETY-SEVEN-FIFTY.      SIXTY.
               SEVENTY-FIVE.  OKAY, THERE'S
               NINETY-EIGHT  DOLLARS  AND   TWENTY
               CENTS...

     HE IS ABOUT TO CHECK HIS OTHER POCKET FOR CHANGE WHEN
     DRUG DEALER ONE STOPS HIM.

                         DRUG DEALER ONE
               FORGET  IT,   DUMBSHIT.

                         RIGGS
               C'MON.  I'M ALMOST THERE.  GIMME
               A MINUTE  TO  --

                        DRUG DEALER ONE
               ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND, YOU STUPID
               FUCK!  ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND!

     RIGGS IS FLOORED.  HE CAN'T BELIEVE HIS EARS.

                        RIGGS
               OH, JESUS ... I CAN'T AFFORD THAT.
               NOT ON MY SALARY.
                    (BEAT)
               LOOK... LET'S DO THIS INSTEAD ...
                    (PULLS OUT HIS
                     WALLET)
               I TAKE YOUR COMPLETE STASH, OKAY?
               I TAKE IT ALL.  FOR FREE.  AND
               YOU ASSHOLES GO TO JAIL.

     AS HE SAYS THIS, HE FLIPS OPEN HIS WALLET AND SHOWS HIS
     BADGE.  THE DRUG DEALERS AT FIRST LOOK STARTLED, THEN
     DISBELIEVING.

                         RIGGS
               I COULD READ YOU  YOUR  RIGHTS,
               BUT ... NAH.  YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT
               YOUR RIGHTS ARE.

                         DRUG  DEALER  ONE
               FUCK YOU, MAN.  THAT BADGE AIN'T
               REAL.  AND YOU AIN'T REAL.

                         DRUG  DEALER  TWO
               BUT YOU'RE SURE AS HELL ONE
               CRAZY FUCK!

     RIGGS' EYES BEGIN TO BLAZE.  HIS NOSTRILS FLARE.  LIKE
     A MANIAC, HE LUNGES AT DRUG  DEALER  TWO.

                         RIGGS
               YOU CALLIN' ME CRAZY!?  YOU
               THINK I'M CRAZY!  YOU, WANNA SEE
               CRAZY?  I'LL SHOW YOU CRAZY!
               THIS IS  CRAZY!

     RIGGS THEN PROCEEDS TO SLAP AND PUMMEL THE DRUG DEALER
     IN THE MANNER OF THE "THREE STOOGES"... COMPLETE WITH
     "WOO-WOO" SOUND  EFFECTS.

     BUT HE ENDS THE ROUTINE BY PULLING A NINE-MILLIMETER
     BARETTA FROM BEHIND HIS BACK AND PRESSING IT AGAINST
     THE NECK OF DRUG DEALER TWO.

                         RIGGS
               THAT'S A REAL BADGE.  I'M A REAL
               COP. AND THIS IS  A  REAL  GUN.
                    (TO THE OTHER TWO
                     DRUG DEALERS)
               FACE DOWN ON THE GROUND.  ARMS
               AND LEGS OUT.  DO IT NOW!

     DEALER ONE AND THREE BEGIN TO FOLLOW ORDERS      BUT RIGGS
     SEES A FLICKER IN THEIR EVES THAT          HIM TO TROUBLE.

      HE SPINS AROUND -- A FOURTH DRUG DEALER  IS  BEHIND  HIM
      WITH A SHOTGUN.  THE SHOTGUN EXPLODES.  RIGGS DUCKS,
      ALLOWING DRUG DEALER TWO TO TAKE THE  FULL  FORCE  OF  THE
      'BLAST IN THE  FACE.

      RIGGS ROLLS IN THE SAWDUST          FIRING HIS BERETTA.
      DEALER FOUR TAKES A BULLET BETWEEN THE EYES.
      DEALER TWO NOW HAS AN AUTOMATIC RIFLE IN HIS HAND.
      IT CHATTERS IN RIGGS' DIRECTION.  SAWDUST AND PINE
      NEEDLES FLY IN THE AIR -- BUT RIGGS IS ABLE TO BLOW
      HIM AWAY.

      ONE MORE DRUG DEALER LEFT.  RIGGS CAN'T FIND HIM.
      HIS EYES DART IN ALL DIRECTIONS.  WHERE IS HE?!

      BEHIND RIGGS, THAT'S WHERE!  HE  PRESSES  A  REVOLVER  TO
      THE BACK OF RIGGS' HEAD, TAKING RIGGS' BARETTA FROM
      HIM AND TUCKING IT INTO HIS BELT.

      THAT'S WHEN:

19B   FIVE NARCOTICS OFFICERS                               19B

      COME RUNNING FROM THEIR STAKEOUT  POSITIONS  AROUND  THE
      LOT. BUT THEY STOP SHORT WHEN  THEY  SEE  THAT  RIGGS  IS
      BEING HELD WITH A GUN POINTED TO HIS HEAD.

      THE DRUG DEALER BEGINS TO MOVE WITH  RIGGS  TOWARD  A  VAN
      PARKED NEARBY.

                          RIGGS
                     (TO OFFICERS)
                SHOOT HIM!  SHOOT HIM!

                          DRUG DEALER
                     (TO RIGGS)
                SHUT  UP!

                          RIGGS
                     (TO DRUG DEALER)
                FUCK YOU!
                     (TO OFFICERS)
                SHOOT HIM!  SHOOT HIM!

     THE NARCOTICS OFFICERS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  THEY
     ARE FRUSTRATED.  HELPLESS.  IMMOBILIZED.

     RIGGS SEES THE VAN LOOMING  UP.  THE  VAN  MEANS  DEFEAT.
     THE VAN MEANS DISGRACE. THE  VAN  MEANS  VICTORY  FOR  THE
     BAD GUYS, AND WE KNOW THAT RIGGS  WOULD  RATHER  DIE  THAN
     BE THE INSTRUMENT OF THE DEALER'S ESCAPE.

19C  CLOSE ON RIGGS AND DRUG DEALER                       19C

     THE VEINS ARE POPPING OUT IN RIGGS' NECK.  THE DRUG
     DEALER IS GETTING NERVOUS AND PANICKY.  HIS GUN HAND
     IS TREMBLING.  THE BARREL OF THE GUN JIGGLES AGAINST
     THE BACK OF  RIGGS'  HEAD.

                         RIGGS
                    (TO DRUG DEALER)
               DO IT, ASSHOLE.  PULL THE TRIGGER.
               PULL THE TRIGGER.

                         DRUG DEALER
               SHUT THE FUCK UP!

     THEY MOVE CLOSER TO THE VAN.  THE NARCOTICS OFFICERS
     HAVE THEIR GUNS POISED FOR ACTION, BUT DON'T DARE USE
     THEM.

                         DRUG DEALER
                    (TO OFFICERS)
               GUNS DOWN!  GUNS DOWN!

                         RIGGS
                    (TO OFFICERS)
               SHOOT HIM!  KILL HIM!
                    (TO DEALER)
               PULL THE TRIGGER!
                    (TO OFFICERS).
               WASTE HIM!
                    (TO DEALER)
               SHOOT ME!
                    (TO OFFICERS)
               KILL HIM!!

     THE DEALER IS SO FREAKED NOW THAT HIS GRIP ON RIGGS
     SLIPS MOMENTARILY -- AND RIGGS SEES HIS OPENING.

     HE SPINS.  KICKS THE DEALER IN THE GROIN.  DISLOCATES
     HIS ARM -- SENDING TLIE GUN  FLYING.  RIGGS RETRIEVES HIS
     BARETTA FROM THE DEALER'S BELT  AND  SHOVES THE BARREL
     INTO THE DEALER'S FACE.

     RIGGS' ENTIRE BODY QUAKES  WITH  RAGE.  HIS FINGER BEGINS
     TO SQUEEZE BACK ON THE  TRIGGER.  HE  WANTS TO KILL THE
     GUY SO BAD HE CAN TASTE IT... AND  YET,  HE      DOESN'T DO IT.

     THE OTHER OFFICERS ARRIVE AND STEP BETWEEN RIGGS AND
     THE DEALER.

     RIGGS TURNS AWAY.  BREATLIING HARD.  ADRENALIN PUMPING.
     HE TUCKS THE BARETTA INTO HIS BELT, THEN NOTICES THAT
     HIS HAND IS COVERED WITH THE SPILLED BLOOD OF ONE OF
     THE DRUG DEALERS.

     IT GIVES RIGGS  PAUSE.  FOR A MOMENT, HE JUST LOOKS AT
     IT.

     HOLD ON RIGGS.   VERY CLOSE.  AND THE LOOK IN HIS EYES.

     POLICE HAVE SELDOM LOOKED THIS BUSY.  YES, THERE ARE
     RINGING PHONES.  YES, THERE ARE CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS.
     YES, IT LOOKS LIKE A CIRCUS.  AND HERE COMES CAPTAIN OF
     DETECTIVES ED MURPHY, MOVING LIKE AN AFTER-BREAKFAST
     JUGGERNAUT.  BEHIND HIM, A YOUNG WOMAN RUSHES TO KEEP UP.
     THE POLICE PSYCHOLOGIST, NO LESS.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               I WANT MARTIN RIGGS PULLED FROM
               DUTY.

               YOU THINK... ?

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               THIS IS UTTER BULLSHIT.

                         MURPHY
               OH, IS IT?  FORGIVE ME.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               MARTIN RIGGS IS A COP WITH  A
               DEATH WISH.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YOU CAN QUOTE ME.  IT HAPPENS TO
               BE MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION.

               UM... GOOD OPINION. SEE  YOU
               TOMORROW.

               RIGGS IS PULLING FOR A PSYCHO
               PENSION.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               OH, DO YOU?

                         MURPHY
               YEAH.  I AM SURE YOU'RE AWARE THE
               DEPARTMENT OFFERS  A  DISABILITY
               STRESS PENSION --

                         PSYCHOLOGIST

                         MURPHY
               GIVE THE LADY A CIGAR.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YOU THINK RIGGS IS PLAYING A GAME?

                         MURPHY
               SURE. HE  WANTS  THE  CASH.  SEEN
               IT A HUNDRED  TIMES.  HE'LL  COME
               AROUND.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               SIR, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT ...  I
               THINK THAT'S A DANGEROUS ATTITUDE
               TO TAKE. MAY I  REMIND  YOU  THAT
               HIS WIFE OF ELEVEN YEARS WAS
               RECENTLY KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT,
               AND

                         MURPHY
               I KNOW ALL ABOUT RIGGS, DOC.  HE'S
               A TOUGH BASTARD.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
                    (INTENSE)
               HE IS ON THE EDGE.  HE MAY BE
               PSYCHOTIC.

                         MURPHY
               BUNCH OF PSYCH BULLSHIT-  LOOK,
               CAN I PEE NOW?

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE
               BY LEAVING HIM IN THE FIELD.
               HE'S   SUICIDAL.

                         MURPHY
               END OF DISCUSSION.  WE'RE GONNA
               WAIT.  AND THEN, IF HE OFFS
               HIMSELF ... WELL, THEN WE'LL KNOW
               I WAS WRONG.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YES, SIR.  THEN WE'LL KNOW.

27   EXT. SIMI VALLEY  -  NIGHT                                      27

     RAIN  SWEEPS  IN  OFF  THE  DESERT.  COLD.  DRENCHING.  RIGGS
     WALKS SLOWLY TOWARD HIS TRAILER HOME, HEAD DOWN.  THE
     RAIN BEATS ON HIM.  HE  DOESN'T  NOTICE.  UNDER  HIS  ARM  HE
     CARRIES A LARGE CARDBOARD BOX.

28   INT. RIGGS' TRAILER - SAME TIME                                 28

     RIGGS ENTERS, SOAKING WET.  SWITCHES ON THE LAMP.
     DEPRESSING.  JAKE  APPEARS,  TAIL  A-THUMP.  TONGUE   WAGGING
     DOGGISHLY.  RIGGS REACHES ATOP THE REFRIGERATOR, GRABS
     A BAG OF PEANUTS.
     OPENS IT, TOSSES IT TO THE DOG.

                         RIGGS
               SAM, EVERY DAY ... IN EVERY WAY ...
               I'M GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.

     OPENS THE BOX AND  REMOVES  ITS  CONTENTS.  BRAND  NEW  COLOR
     TELEVISION.  PLUGS IT IN.  SWITCHES IT ON.  SITS DOWN
     WITH A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.  DRINKS.  ON THE SCREEN, THE
     GRINCH STEALS CHRISTMAS FROM THE RESIDENTS OF WHOVILLE.

29   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   29

     RIGGS OPENS A DRAWER BESIDE HIM, AND TAKES OUT A BOTTLE
     OF SLEEPING PILLS. PICKS IT  UP.  AS  HE  DOES  --  THE  SOUND
     OF THE TELEVISION FADES OUT -- SILENCE, DEAD SILENCE...
     AS RIGGS ROLLS THE BOTTLE IN HIS FINGERS.  SLOWLY,
     THOUGHTFULLY, UNSCREWS THE CAP ... DUMPS THEM ON THE TABLE.
     RUNS HIS  FINGERS  THROUGH  THEM.  CLICK...  CLICK...  STARES.
     MESMERIZED.  RAIN BEATS ON THE WINDOW.

30   EXT. TRAILER                                               30

     THE RAIN CONTINUES TO HAMMER THE LONELY LITTLE PIT  WHICH
     RIGGS CALLS HOME.

     A ZOO.  A SIGN READS METRO ROBBERY/HOMICIDE.

     ROGER MURTAUGH SITS AT HIS DESK, LOST IN THOUGHT.
     BEHIND HIM, MCCASKEY, CLASS THREE DETECTIVE.  HE TALKS
     TO MURTAUGH:

                         MCCASKEY
               SEE, YOU'RE BEHIND THE TIMES,
               SARGE.  GUYS IN THE EIGHTIES
               AREN'T TOUGH.  THEY'RE SENSITIVE
               PEOPLE.  THEY SHOW EMOTIONS AROUND
               WOMEN AND SHIT LIKE THAT.
                    (BEAT)
               I THINK I'M AN EIGHTIES MAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               HOW YOU FIGURE?

                         MCCASKEY
               LAST NIGHT:  I CRIED IN BED, SO
               HOW'S THAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               WERE YOU WITH A  WOMAN?
                         MCCASKEY
               NO, I WAS ALONE, WHY THE FUCK YOU
               THINK I WAS CRYING?

                         MURTAUGH
               SOUNDS LIKE AN EIGHTIES MAN TO ME.

     ANOTHER DETECTIVE ENTERS.  RAIL-THIN, NOSE LIKE A BEAK.
     HIS NAME IS BURKE.

     BEHIND HIM IN THE DOOR FRAME WE SEE A FAT COP PASS BY
     DOWN THE HALL, WALKING BACKWARDS; A BEAT, AND THEN HE  IS
     FOLLOWED BY FOUR MORE COPS SINGING THE WORLD'S  SHITTIEST
     RENDITION OF "IT CAME UPON A MIDNIGHT CLEAR."  IT  SOUNDS
     LIKE PIGS MATING.

     BURKE APPROACHES MURTAUGH:

                         BURKE
               GOT SOME NEWS ON THE LLOYD CASE,
               ROG.

                         MURTAUGH
               THAT WAS QUICK.

                         BURKE
               SO WAS THE AUTOPSY.
                    (TAKES A DEEP
                     BREATH)
               YOU READY FOR THIS?  THEY'RE NOT
               CALLING IT SUICIDE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT?

                         BURKE
               SURPRISE, SURPRISE.  FIRST OFF,
               CORONER FOUND EVIDENCE SHE TOOK
               BARBITURATES.

                         MURTAUGH
               BRILLIANT.  THERE WAS AN OPEN
               BOTTLE ON HER TABLE.

                         BURKE
               RIGHT, RIGHT.  THAT'S NOT THE
               SURPRISE.  SURPRISE IS SOMEONE
               DOCTORED  THE  PILLS.
                    (BEAT)
               EVERY CAPSULE WAS LOADED WITH
               DRAIN   CLEANER.

                         MURTAUGH
               JESUS ...

                         BURKE
               IF SHE HADN'T JUMPED, SHE WOULDA
               BEEN DEAD INSIDE FIFTEEN MINUTES.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (SIGHS)
               THIS CASE BLOWS.

32   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             32

     ACROSS THE ROOM, A DETECTIVE TAKES OFF HIS GUN AND
     SLINGS THE HOLSTER ACROSS HIS CHAIR.  AS HE EXITS FRAME
     -- PAN TO REVEAL:  MARTIN RIGGS AS HE ENTERS THE SQUAD
     ROOM.  SHUFFLES FROM FOOT TO FOOT, LOOKING LOST.  LIGHTS
     A SMOKE.

33   ACROSS ROOM                                               33

     MURTAUGH SLINGS ON A JACKET.  TURNS TO GO.  NOTICES
     RIGGS.

34   MURTAUGH'S POV                                            34

     RIGGS RESEMBLES A BAG PERSON.  UNSHAVEN, LIMP DIRTY
     HAIR, GRIMY LEATHER JACKET.

35   BACK TO SCENE                                             35

     HE FROWNS, SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               MCCASKEY, IF MY WIFE CALLS, TELL
               HER LATE DINNER.

                         BURKE
               HO, ROG-  I'M NOT THROUGH YET.
               I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU TWO MORE
               THINGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               SHOOT.

     HE IS STILL LOOKING AT RIGGS, WHO IS SLOWLY WANDERING
     FROM DESK TO DESK, SMOKING -- STOPPING NEAR THE DESK WITH
     THE HOLSTERED GUN.

                         BURKE
               FIRST, CONDITION OF THE SHEETS AND
               MATTRESS INDICATE SOMEONE WAS IN
               BED WITH AMANDA LLOYD JUST BEFORE
               SHE DIED.  THAT'S A.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S B?

                         BURKE
               B IS, I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU
               YOU'RE BREAKING IN A NEW PARTNER
               ON THIS.

     NOW MURTAUGH IS EYEBALLING RIGGS.  CAUTIOUS.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (DISTRACTED)
               I DON'T WORK PARTNERS.

                         BURKE
               YOU DO NOW.  C.I.T. TRANSFER, SOME
               BURNOUT THEY WANT YOU TO KEEP ON
               A LEASH.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, PERFECT.  CAN I TRADE IN MY
               LIFE FOR A NEW ONE?

     AT WHICH POINT, ACROSS THE ROOM, RIGGS REMOVES THE HOL-
     STERED GUN AND HEFTS IT, CURIOUSLY.  SUDDENLY ALL HELL
     BREAKS LOOSE:

                         MURTAUGH
               GUN !!

     HE BOLTS LIKE A CHEETAH.

     COPS DIVE FOR COVER, A SECRETARY SHRIEKS, AND MURTAUGH
     GOES PLOWING THROUGH THE SQUAD ROOM LIKE AN EXPRESS
     TRAIN, BLOWING PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY -- COPS GRABBING
     FOR THEIR HOLSTERS -- RIGGS, MEANWHILE, LOOKING AROUND
     FRANTICALLY, HE'S TRYING TO FIND THE GUY WITH THE GUN
     WHO IS, OF COURSE, HIMSELF.

     MURTAUGH TAKES A FLYING LEAP      SAILS ACROSS
     THE DESK, GOING FOR  THE  GLORY   AND RIGGS, IN THE
     BLINK OF AN EYE,  SIMPLY  DUCKS   AND FLIPS MURTAUGH
     NEATLY OVER ONE SHOULDER.  THERE  IS A HIDEOUS CRASH
     OF BREAKING GLASS AND OVERTURNING FURNITURE.  OUCH...
     MCCASKEY, MEANWHILE, SCREAMS TO BURKE:

                         MCCASKEY
               WHAT THE SHIT IS GOING ON?

     BURKE SIGHS, SHAKES  HIS  HEAD:

     ROGER JUST MET HIS NEW PARTNER.

     DARKNESS.  A SOFT CLICK AS A GUN IS COCKED.  THE BARREL
     GLEAMS FAINTLY IN THE DIM LIGHT.  A VOICE:

     THE DOOR OPENS INTO A DIMLY-LIT OFFICE.  STAINED  CARPET.
     ROTTEN WOOD.  A DESK.

     BEHIND THE DESK SITS A LARGE, RUGGED MAN WITH EYES LIKE

               NO.  YOU'RE NOT WRONG.

                         MENDEZ
               AND I'M  SUPPOSED TO TRUST THESE

                         GENERAL
               MY PEOPLE ARE LOYAL, MR. MENDEZ.
               THEY ARE LOYAL  TO  ME.

                         MENDEZ
               BULLSHIT.

                         GENERAL
               JOSHUA.  HOLD OUT YOUR HAND.

     JOSHUA STEPS UP TO THE GENERAL AND EXTENDS HIS ARM.

                         GENERAL
               DO YOU SMOKE, MR. MENDEZ?

                         MENDEZ

     MENDEZ FROWNS, CAUTIOUSLY HANDS A SILVER CIGARETTE
     LIGHTER TO THE GENERAL.
     WHO PROMPTLY PULLS AN OLD G. GORDON LIDDY MANEUVER:

     HE HOLDS THE FLAME RIGHT UNDER JOSHUA'S HAND.  SEARING
     IT.  MENDEZ LOOKS ON, A TRIFLE PALE.

     AS FOR JOSHUA, HE MAKES NO SOUND AT ALL.  SIMPLY STANDS,
     TRANCE-LIKE.

                         GENERAL
               YOU WISH TO DO BUSINESS WITH US,

                         MURTAUGH
               IT'S OVER, YOU KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               WHAT IS?

                         MURTAUGH
               THE WAR.

                         RIGGS
               YES.  I KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               BAD MANNERS, MAN.

     RIGGS REMOVES THE GUN HIMSELF.  STEERS WITH HIS KNEES.
     DROPS THE CHAMBERED BULLET.  SLIPS OUT THE MAGAZINE,
     HANDS THE GUN TO ------------

                         MURTAUGH

               SOME SERIOUS SHIT.

               LOT OF OLD-TIMERS CARRY THAT.

     MURTAUGH SHOOTS HIM A LOOK.  REPLACES THE GUN.

                         MURTAUGH
               FILE SAYS YOU'RE REGISTERED WITH
               NEWARK P.D. AS A LETHAL WEAPON.

                         RIGGS
               FILE DON'T LIE.  LOOK, FRIEND,
               LET'S CUT THE SHIT.  WE BOTH
               KNOW WHY I WAS TRANSFERRED.
               EVERYONE THINKS I'M SUICIDAL, IN
               WHICH CASE I'M FUCKED AND NO ONE
               WANTS TO WORK WITH ME.  OR THEY
               THINK I'M FAKING TO DRAW A PSYCHO
               PENSION, IN WHICH CASE I'M FUCKED
               AND NO ONE WANTS TO WORK WITH ME.
               BASICALLY,  I'M  FUCKED.

                         MURTAUGH
               GUESS WHAT?

                         RIGGS
               WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH YOU.

                         RIGGS
               THEN DON'T.

                         MURTAUGH
               AIN'T GOT NO CHOICE.  DAMN.
               WE'RE BOTH FUCKED.

                    RIGGS
                  TERRIFIC.

     AS THEY SPEAK, RIGGS HAS PULLED TO A  STOP  IN  FRONT  OF  A
     LARGE  DOWNTOWN  BANK  BUILDING.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (RUBS  HIS  EYES)
               I'M VERY OLD ...

               ... GOD HATES ME, THAT'S WHAT
               IT IS.

                         RIGGS

     HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE.

41   INT. BANK  BUILDING  -  DAY                            41

     DICK LLOYD'S OFFICE:  EVERYTHING  ABOUT  IT  LOOKS  STARCHED
     AND PERFECT. IN  THE  B.G.,  BANK  EMPLOYEES  SHUTTLE  BETWEEN
     DESKS, BUILDING  AND  TOPPLING  EMPIRES.  DICK  LLOYD  PACES
     BACK AND FORTH. HE IS THE  MAN  WE  SAW  EARLIER  IN  AMANDA'S
     PLIOTOGRAPH, STANDING NEXT TO  MURTAUGH.  NOW  HE  LOOKS  LIKE
     SHIT. HE ADDRESSES RIGGS  AND  MURTAUGH,  WHO  ARE  SEATED  IN
     THE  OFFICE.
                         LLOYD
               MURDER ...  BUT  I  THOUGHT  ...

                         MURTAUGH
               POISONED.  EVEN IF SHE HADN'T
               JUMPED ... SHE'D STILL BE DEAD.

                         LLOYD
               JESUS.
                    (BEAT)
               JESUS,  I  CAN'T  TAKE -------.

     HE SITS, STARING OUT THE WINDOW.  A BROKEN MAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               DICK, WHY DID YOU CALL ME
               YESTERDAY?

                         LLOYD
                    (VERY  FAR  AWAY)
               CALLED YOU...?  YEAH.  THAT'S
               RIGHT ... I HEARD YOU WERE WORKING
               OUT HERE ... I WANTED  YOU  TO  FIND
               HER  FOR  ME,  ROGER.  TAKE  HER

                         MURTAUGH
               OUT OF WHAT?

                         LLOYD
               SHE DID MOVIES, ROGER ... NAKED
               MOVIES ... SAW ONE OF THEM......  SAW
               MY LITTLE BABY ... SMILING......  SHE
               DID IT ... WITH  A  WOMAN.  SHE    WAS
               ON TOP OF  A  WOMAN,  ROGER-...!

                         MURTAUGH
               EASY, DICK.

     LLOYD TURNS, FACING THEM.  INTENSE:

                         LLOYD
               I WANT A PROMISE.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU OWE ME.  YOU KNOW YOU DO.

                         MURTAUGH
               YES.  I KNOW THAT.

                         LLOYD
               WHEN YOU FIND WHO  DID  IT,  I  WANT
               YOU TO KILL THEM.  IF IT'S MORE
               THAN ONE, I WANT YOU TO KILL ALL OF
               THEM.  MAKE THEM SQUIRM FIRST, TAKE
               YOUR TIME ... AND FUCKING KILL THEM.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M A POLICE OFFICER, DICK.

                         LLOYD
               FORGET THE LAW.  IT'S EASY TO DO.
               YOU OWE ME.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (PAUSE; THEN)
               WE HAVE TO GO NOW.

     LLOYD DOES NOT LOOK UP.  RIGGS AND MURTAUGH HEAD FOR THE
     DOOR.

                         LLOYD
               I KNOW YOU CAN, ROGER.  YOU KILL
               THEM. YOU  DO  THAT.

     THE COPS EXIT.  THE DOOR SHUTS.

42   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                              42

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH HEAD IOR THE CAR.  RIGGS TAKES OUT A
     PACK OF CIGARETTES.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU GONNA SMOKE IN THE CAR?

                         RIGGS
               THINKING ABOUT IT.

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC.

     HE PUTS THE TOP DOWN.
     RIGGS TAKES OUT A CIGARETTE, STARTS TO PUT IT IN HIS
     MOUTH.  STOPS.

                         RIGGS
               WHOOPS.  SHIT.

     HE REPLACES IT IN THE PACK, TAKES ANOTHER.  MURTAUGH
     LOOKS AT HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THAT ONE?

     RIGGS POINTS TO THE TIP OF THE REPLACED CIGARETTE.  WE
     NOTICE TWO THINGS:  A)  IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT FIFTY
     YEARS OLD; AND  B) THERE IS A TINY RED MARK, CIRCLING THE
     FILTER.

                         RIGGS
               THIS ONE IS THE LAST CIGARETTE
               I'LL EVER SMOKE.
               TRICK I LEARNED FROM  MY  DAD.  I
               SMOKE ALL I WANT, BUT WHEN I SMOKE
               THIS ONE ... I'M THROUGH.

                         MURTAUGH
               BRILLIANT.  GET IN THE CAR.

                         RIGGS
               WANT ME TO DRIVE?

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE SUICIDAL, REMEMBER?

                         RIGGS
               ANYONE WHO DRIVES IN LOS ANGELES
               IS SUICIDAL.

     THEY GET IN.  MURTAUGH HEAVES A SIGH, STARES BLEAKLY OUT
     THE WINDOW.  A MOMENT, THEN RIGGS SAYS:

                         RIGGS
               HE SAID YOU OWED  HIM.  WHAT  DID
               HE MEAN?

                         MURTAUGH
               WE SERVED TOGETHER  IN  '65.  HE
               SAVED MY LIFE IN THE LA DRANG
               VALLEY.  TOOK A BAYONET  IN  THE
               LUNG.

                         RIGGS
               THAT WAS NICE OF HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               I THOUGHT SO.

     THE RADIO SQUAWKS. MURTAUGH  TURNS  IT  UP.

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS GREAT.  I LOVE THIS JOB.

                         MURTAUGH
               STOW IT.

43   EXT. CITY INTERSECTION - DAY                            43

     A BUILDING, TEN STORIES HIGH.  ON THE LEDGE, A LONE MAN
     POISED HIGH ABOVE THE STREET.  BENEATH HIM, A CROWD HAS
     GATHERED.  A POLICE CAR.  A SEARCHLIGHT.  A CROWD OF
     OFFICE WORKERS, RUBBER-NECKING TO BEAT THE BAND.  ONE OR
     TWO KIDS YELL, "JUMP, JUMP."

     MURTAUGH'S CAR GLIDES TO THE CURB.  THE DOORS BURST OPEN
     AND THE TWO PARTNERS EMERGE.  A PATROL COP APPROACHES.

                         PATROL  COP
               HEY, SARGE, YOU WANNA HANDLE
               THIS?

                         MURTAUGH
               WHERE'S THE PSYCHOLOGIST?

                         PATROL  COP
               SITTING IN TRAFFIC.

                         MURTAUGH
               SWELL.
                    (BEAT)
               WHO'S THE  GUY?

                         PATROL  COP
               SALESMAN NAME OF MACCLEARY.  LEFT
               THE OFFICE PARTY.  WENT UPSTAIRS
               AND WALKED OUT ON THE LEDGE.

                         MURTAUGH
               THINK HE'LL GO?

                         PATROL  COP
               SEEMS SERIOUS ENOUGH.  WHO KNOWS?

     RIGGS CLEARS HIS THROAT.  MURTAUGH TURNS.

                         RIGGS
               I CAN HANDLE THIS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU QUALIFIED TO TALK TO JUMPERS?

                         RIGGS
               I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (RELUCTANT;  THEN)
               OKAY.  YOU'RE ELECTED.
                    (AS RIGGS
                     TURNS TO GO)
               HEY.
                    (AS RIGGS STOPS)
               NO GUNS.  NO KUNG FU.  JUST ...
               BRING HIM IN.

                         RIGGS
               SURE.  BRING HIM IN.

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGHT.

     RIGGS MOVES OFF TOWARD THE BUILDING.  MURTAUGH LOOKS
     AFTER HIM.  WAS THIS A MISTAKE ... ?

44   EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY                                         44

     RIGGS APPEARS ON THE ROOF.  THERE, ABOUT FIVE YARDS AWAY,
     STANDS THE JUMPER.  AGITATED.  BREATHING HARD.

     BELOW IS TEN STORIES OF OPEN SPACE.  THE WIND BLOWS.
     RIGGS NODS TO THE JUMPER.

                         MACCLEARY (JUMPER)
               GO AWAY.

                         RIGGS
               MY NAME IS RIGGS.

                         MACCLEARY
               FUCK OFF.

                         RIGGS
               I CAN'T DO THAT.
                    (BEAT)
               WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

               LOOK, I KNOW ALL THE PSYCHOLOGY
               BULLSHIT, IT WON'T WORK.

                         RIGGS
               I'M NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST.

                         MACCLEARY
               YEAH?  WHAT ARE YOU?

                         RIGGS
               HOMICIDE COP.

               YOU'RE EARLY.  HANG ON A COUPLE
               MINUTES, YOU CAN GO TO WORK.

                         RIGGS
               AT LEAST TELL ME YOUR NAME.  LOOK,

               OF PAPER.  OKAY?

                    (SWALLOWS)
               LEN.  LEN MACCLEARY.

               M -- A -- C, NOW GET OUTTA HERE.

     RIGGS LEANS OUT FARTHER, PERCHES ON THE LEDGE.  ABSOLUTELY
     CALM.

                         RIGGS
               WHY  ARE  YOU  DOING  THIS?

                         MACCLEARY
               NONE OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS.

                         RIGGS
               FAIR ENOUGH.
                     (PAUSE; THEN)
               I'M COMING OUT.  TAKE IT EASY.

     RIGGS STANDS, STEPS OUT ONTO THE NARROW LEDGE.  HE SEEMS
     UNCONCERNED.

                         MACCLEARY
               DON'T  COME  NEAR  ME!

                         RIGGS
               SSSHHH.  EASY.  I'M JUST GOING TO

     ON THE GROUND BELOW, ROGER MURTAUGH REACTS WITH DISBELIEF.
     HIS PARTNER IS TAKING AN INSANE RISK.  UP ABOVE, RIGGS
     PAUSES.  AROUND HIM THE WIND BLOWS TREACHEROUSLY.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST GUY TO THINK
               OF THIS, YOU KNOW.  EVERYONE'S GOT
               PROBLEMS.

                         MACCLEARY
               YOU KNOW SHIT.

                         RIGGS
               WRONG.  YOU'RE WRONG.
                    (BEAT)
               I ALMOST TRIED THIS ONCE.
               SERIOUSLY.  MY WIFE.  GOT KILLED
               IN A CAR CRASH.  ONLY PERSON I
               EVER CARED ABOUT.  I NEVER HAD
               KIDS.

                         MACCLEARY
               YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART.

     RIGGS TAKES OUT HIS WALLET, FLASHES IT AT MACCLEARY.

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS HER PICTURE.

                         MACCLEARY
               NICE.  FUCK OFF.

                         RIGGS
               I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU I UNDERSTAND,
               YOU DOPE.

     HE TAKES A STEP CLOSER.

                         MACCLEARY
               DON'T TOUCH ME.  I'M NOT DOING
               ANYTHING WRONG.

                         RIGGS
               I KNOW THAT.  NOT LIKE YOU'RE
               MURDERING ANYONE.

                         MACCLEARY
               RIGHT.  ONLY ONE HURT IS ME.

                         RIGGS
               SAME WAY I LOOK AT IT.  I'M GONNA
               STAND BESIDE  YOU,  OKAY?

                         MACCLEARY
               NO!
                    (BEAT)
               DAMMIT, KEEP AWAY.

                         RIGGS
               PLEASE.  THIS IS SCARY STUFF.
               JUST ... LET ME STAND NEXT TO YOU.

                         MACCLEARY
               DON'T TRY NOTHING.

                         RIGGS
               I TRY SOMETHING, WE BOTH GO.

                         MACCLEARY
               RIGHT.

     RIGGS SLOWLY STEPS UP TO THE MAN.  SHUDDERS.

                         RIGGS
               THERE.  FUCKIN' COLD,UP HERE.

                    (LOOKS  AROUND  AT
                     THE SEA OF TRAFFIC
                     FAR BELOW)
               HERE WE ARE.
                    (BEAT)
               GOD, THIS IS REALLY SCARY.  I'M
               SCARED.

                         MACCLEARY
               ME,  TOO.

                         RIGGS
               YOU WANNA SMOKE?
                    (PULLS OUT
                     CIGARETTES)
               LET'S SMOKE, OKAY?

                         MACCLEARY
               SURE.

     RIGGS OFFERS A SMOKE.  MACCLEARY REACHES FOR IT.  AND RIGGS
     SNAPS A HANDCUFF ON HIS WRIST.  SNAPS THE OTHER END ONTO
     HIS OWN WRIST.

                         MACCLEARY
               HEY ...

                         RIGGS
               SORRY.
                    (BEAT)
               SEE  THIS  KEY?

     HE HOLDS UP THE KEY TO THE CUFFS.  FLINGS IT OUT INTO
     SPACE.

                         RIGGS
               WE'RE  TOGETHER  ON  THIS.  YOU  CAN
               GO IF YOU  WANT.  BUT  YOU  TAKE  ME
               WITH  YOU.  MAKES  YOU  A  MURDERER.

                         MACCLEARY
               YOU BASTARD.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'LL BE KILLING A COP.

     SILENCE.

                         RIGGS
               I'M GOING INSIDE.  WHAT SAY YOU
               COME WITH ME?

     HE TURNS, STARTS TO EASE ALONG THE LEDGE.  MACCLEARY
     SWALLOWS HARD, SAYS:

                         MACCLEARY
               FUCK YOU, I'M JUMPING.

     AND SUDDENLY RIGGS TURNS ON HIM.  EYES LIKE STEEL.

                         RIGGS
               YOU WANNA JUMP ... ?  YOU REALLY
               WANT TO ... ?
                    (LONG  PAUSE;
                     THEN)
               FINE. LET'S  DO  IT.

     HE STEPS TO THE EDGE.

                        MACCLEARY
              HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ...

                        RIGGS
              YOU ASKED FOR IT.

                        MACCLEARY
              HEY, WAIT A MINUTE ... !

     RIGGS DOES SOMETHING VERY  DRASTIC.  HE  JERKS  THEM  BOTH
     OFF THE LEDGE.  HOLY SHIT.  THE CROWD GASPS.

                         RIGGS
               GERONIMOOOOOO ...

     AS DOWN THEY PLUNGE, ALL TEN STORIES -- TUMBLING AND
     FALLING -- MACCLEARY SHRIEKING LIKE A LUNATIC ... AND
     SUDDENLY, BAM -- !  THEY LAND IN A FIREMAN'S NET.  BOUNCE
     A FEW TIMES. COME TO REST, SAFE  AND  UNHARMED  ...  RIGGS
     ROLLS OVER WITH A SOUR LOOK ON HIS FACE.  COPS SURROUND
     THEM.  MACCLEARY IS A TRIFLE UPSET.

                         MACCLEARY
               GET HIM AWAY FROM ME!!  CUT ME
               LOOSE!!  CRAZY FUCKER TRIED TO
               KILL ME!!  DID YOU SEE THAT??  HE
               TRIED TO KILL  ME!!!

     AND SO ON, SCREAMING AND RANTING --  AS  A  UNIFORMED  COP
     CUTS RIGGS FREE WITH A SET OF CLIPPERS.  RIGGS STANDS
     SHAKILY. STEPS AWAY FROM  THE  NET.  AND  THERE  IS  ROGER
     MURTAUGH.  VISIBLY   UPSET.

     DID I SAY UPSET?  I MEANT ENRAGED.  HE GRABS RIGGS, SLAMS
     HIM AGAINST THE WALL.  TRIES TO GRAB HIS COLLAR.  RIGGS'
     HAND SHOOTS OUT.  LIGHTNING FAST.  STOPS MURTAUGH'S HAND.
     STOPS IT COLD.  THEY STARE INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES.

                         RIGGS
               DON'T ... TOUCH ME.

     MURTAUGH WILL NOT BACK DOWN.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST DO???

                         RIGGS
               I CONTROLLED THE JUMP.  YOU WANTED
               HIM DOWN.  HE'S DOWN.

                         MURTAUGH
               C'MERE.


     HE YANKS RIGGS AROUND THE CORNER, AWAY FROM THE OTHER
     COPS.

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY, TURKEY, NO BULLSHIT.  DO YOU
               WANT  TO  KILL  YOURSELF?

                         RIGGS
               AW, FOR CHRISSAKE ...

                         MURTAUGH
               SHUT UP.  JUST YES OR NO, DO YOU
               WANT TO DIE?  HUH?  YES OR NO?

                         RIGGS
               I GOT THE JOB DONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING THE
               QUESTION!!!

                         RIGGS
                    (ANGRY)
               WHAT DO YOU WANNA HEAR, MAN?  YOU
               WANNA HEAR THAT I GOT A BOTTLE OF
               PILLS IN MY ROOM?  I DO.  EVERY
               DAY I WAKE UP, I LOOK FOR A REASON
               NOT TO TAKE THEM.  DOING THE JOB,
               THAT'S ... THAT'S THE REASON.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT HIM.  NODS.  A MOMENT, THEN:

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU WANT TO DIE.

                         RIGGS
               I'M NOT AFRAID OF IT.

                         MURTAUGH
               HERE.
                    (UNHOLSTERS
                     HIS GUN)
               PILLS ARE TOO SLOW.  USE A GUN.
               USE MY GUN.  GO AHEAD, PAL.

     A PAUSE.   RIGGS LOOKS AT THE GUN.

                         MURTAUGH
               BE MY GUEST.

     HE OFFERS THE GUN TO RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               GO AHEAD.  IF YOU'RE SERIOUS.

     RIGGS SMILES, TAKES THE GUN WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT.  PUTS
     IT TO HIS HEAD.  CLICK -- !  THE HAMMER IS COCKED.
     MURTAUGH AND RIGGS STARE EACH OTHER DOWN.  TENSE.  READING
     EACH  OTHER.

                         RIGGS
               YOU SHOULDN'T TEMPT ME, ROGER.

                         MURTAUGH
               PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH.  BULLET GOES
               IN YOUR EAR, MIGHT NOT KILL YOU.

     MEANWHILE, IN THE B.G., PEDESTRIANS ARE DIVING FOR COVER.
     MURTAUGH AND RIGGS ARE OBLIVIOUS.  RIGGS PUTS THE GUN
     UNDER HIS CHIN.

                         RIGGS
               UNDER THE CHIN'S JUST AS GOOD.

     THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER.  RIGGS' FINGER BEGINS TO
     TIGHTEN ON THE TRIGGER.  TURNS WHITE WITH PRESSURE.
     IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO DO IT.
     AT THE LAST SECOND, MURTAUGH JAMS HIS THUMB IN FRONT OF
     THE HAINMER, AND CLICK
     JESUS ...
     THE HAINMER THUDS AGAINST HIS THUMB.

     MURTAUGH GRABS THE GUN.  STARES AT RIGGS, WILD-EYED.

                         MURTAUGH
               JESUS.  YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO DRAW
               A PSYCHO PENSION.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU'RE REALLY CRAZY ...

                         RIGGS
                    (SMILES  COLDLY)
               SO NOW YOU KNOW.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  NOW I KNOW.

46   INT. POLICE  LINEUP  -  DAY                                46

     THE POLICE PSYCHOLOGIST WE MET EARLIER  IS TALKING ON THE
     TELEPHONE:

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YOU'RE ASKING ME IF HE'S STABLE
               AND I'M TELLING YOU NO.  WE'RE
               TALKING ABOUT A MAN WHO CARVES
               NOTCHES IN HIS GUN BARREL.  ORE
               FOR EACH KILL.  HE BLEW A MAN
               TO PIECES YESTERDAY.  IS THIS
               HELPING?

                                             INTERCUT:

47   ROGER MURTAUGH                                           47

     STANDING AT A PAY PHONE, LISTENING.  HE NODS:

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC.  SO YOU'RE SAYING I
               SHOULD WORRY.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               ARE YOU KIDDING?  THE GUY'S A TIME
               BOMB.  WHEN HE GOES... STAND BACK.

                         MURTAUGH
               THANK YOU, DOCTOR.  YOU'VE BEEN
               VERY HELPFUL.

     HE HANGS UP.  RUBS HIS EYES TIREDLY AND SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT.

                                              CUT TO:

48   INT. MURTAUGH'S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY                    48

     SILENCE.  MURTAUGH FUMES.  RIGGS KEEPS HIS MOUTH SHUT.
     MURTAUGH TAKES HIS ANGER OUT ON THE ROAD:  SLAMMING THE
     BRAKES; SQUEALING AROUND CORNERS, ETC.

     BUT HE CAN'T HOLD IT 'IN.  HE EXPLODES:

                         MURTAUGH
                    (POUNDING HIS FIST
                     AGAINST THE WHEEL)
               IT'S MY  BIRTHDAY,  DAMNIT!  FIFTY
               YEARS OLD TODAY!  FIFTY GODDAMN
               YEARS OLD!  THIRTY YEARS ON THE

               HOUSE! FISHING  BOAT!  BUT  I  CAN
               KISS ALL THAT GOODBYE,  'CAUSE  MY
               NEW PARTNER'S GOT A DEATH WISH!
               MY FUCKIN' LIFE IS OVER!

                         RIGGS
               ROGER --

                         MURTAUGH
               SHUT UP!  WHY YOU TALKIN' TO ME?!
               I'M NOT HE'RE ANYMORE!  I'M  GONE!
               I'M DEAD!  YOU'RE GONNA SEE TO
               THAT!  YOU WANNA DIE -- AND YOU'RE
               GONNA TAKE ME WITH YOU!

     SILENCE AGAIN.  MURTAUGH GNASHES HIS TEETH.  RIGGS  LOOKS
     AT HIM WITH A VERY SERIOUS EXPRESSION.

                         RIGGS
               I DIDN'T  KNOW  THAT.

                         MURTAUGH
               KNOW WHAT?!

                         RIGGS
               THAT TODAY WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY.
                    (BEAT)
               HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ROGER.  I MEAN
               THAT SINCERELY.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS TAKEN ABACK BY THE GENUINE SOUND OF  AFFEC-
     TION IN RIGGS' VOICE.

                         RIGGS
               I JUST HOPE WE STAY ALIVE LONG
               ENOUGH FOR ME TO BUY YOU A PRESENT.

     RIGGS SAYS THIS WITH A STRAIGHT FACE -- BUT THERE IS
     A PLAYFUL GLINT IN HIS EYE THAT MURTAUGH DOESN'T MISS.
     AND HE LAUGHS OUT LOUD IN SPITE OF HIMSELF.  IT BREAKS
     THE TENSION, AND RIGGS  KNOWS  IT.

                         RIGGS
               WHERE WE GOING?

                         MURTAUGH

               REMEMBER ... THIS GUY ISN'T A
               SUSPECT YET.  WE'RE GONNA
               QUESTION HIM; NOT DAMAGE
               HIM.

     RIGGS RAISES HIS HANDS -- AS IF TO SAY, I'LL BE ON MY
     BEST BEHAVIOR.  MURTAUGH SWINGS THE CAR ONTO SUNSET
     BLVD.

               OVER DEAD, HOW'S THAT FOR A
               PROBLEM... ?  YES, I'M HOLDING
               TWO KEYS NOW.  TERRIFIC, CALL
               ME BACK.

                                              CUT TO:

52   EXT. WOODEN GATE - SAME TIME                              52

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH APPROACH THE GATE.  RIGGS TOSSES OUT
     A CIGARETTE.  SUDDENLY --
     THERE IS AN ELECTRIC HUM AND THE GATE GLIDES SOFTLY OPEN,
     ADMITTING A RED HONDA SCOOTER, A DASHING BLONDE BEHIND
     THE WHEEL.  SHE ROARS OFF DOWN THE STREET.

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH EXCHANGE GLANCES.
     THE GATE CLICKS, STARTS TO GLIDE SHUT.

     THE COPS ENTER.

53   EXT. HOUSE WINDOW - SAME TIME                              53

     RIGGS' FACE COMES INTO FRAME, PEERING CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH
     A PLATE GLASS WINDOW.  HE WHISTLES SOFTLY.

                         RIGGS
               TAKE A LOOK.

     MURTAUGH STEPS TO THE WINDOW, LOOKS IN.

54   MURTAUGH'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW                       54

     ENOUGH COCAINE TO SERVICE THE THIRD TIER AT YANKEE
     STADIUM.

     A BLONDE, BIKINI-CLAD WONDER SITS ON THE COUCH, HAPPILY
     SNORTING.  SHE SEES MURTAUGH AND WAVES HILARIOUSLY.
     MAKES COME-HITHER GESTURES.

     MURTAUGH SCOWLS, TURNS TO RIGGS.

                         RIGGS
               I'M THINKING PROBABLE CAUSE.

                         MURTAUGH
               JESUS.  MAYBE I SHOULD CALL FOR
               BACKUP.

                         RIGGS
               WHAT AM I, CHOPPED LIVER?

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT HIM.  SIGHS.

                         MURTAUGH
               NO KILLING.

                         RIGGS
               NO KILLING.

     HE GRINS CHEESILY-

56   EXT. SOLARIUM                                                  56

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH APPROACH  THE  FROSTED  GLASS  DOOR.  THEY
     DRAW THEIR GUNS.

                         MURTAUGH
               NICE AND EASY.

                         RIGGS
               NICE AND EASY.

     MURTAUGH TAKES A DEEP BREATH.  KICKS OPEN THE DOOR.

                         MURTAUGH
               POLICE.  HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

57   INT. SOLARIUM                                                  57

     THE RICH GUY DOES NOT HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.  IN FACT, HE
     HAS ALREADY SNATCHED UP THE SHOTGUN.  HE TRIGGERS A
     BLAST, BLOWS OUT GLASS  NEXT  TO  MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH  DIVES,
     ROLLS, COMES UP IN A COMBAT CROUCH.  BAM --- THE RICH
     GUY TAKES IT IN THE SHOULDER.  SPINS AROUND.  THE GUN
     CLATTERS TO THE GROUND.  RIGGS AND MURTAUGH APPROACH,
     GUNS DRAWN.  THE RICH GUY WRITHES ON THE GROUND, CLUTCH-
     ING HIS SHOULDER.  MURTAUGH SAYS TO RIGGS:

                         MURTAUGH
               SEE HOW EASY THAT WAS?  BOOM.
               STILL ALIVE.  NOW WE TAKE THE GUN
               AWAY ...
                    (HE DOES)
               ... AND WE QUESTION HIM.  KNOW
               WHY WE CAN QUESTION HIM?  BECAUSE
               I GOT HIM IN THE SHOULDER.  I
               DIDN'T BLOW HIM UP OR JUMP OFF A
               BUILDING WITH HIM.

                         RIGGS
               NO FAIR, THE  BUILDING  GUY  LIVED.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHATEVER.  THE POINT IS, NO
               KILLING.

                         RIGGS
               NO KILLING.

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGHT.  PIECE  OF  CAKE.  I'M  VERY
               HAPPY. READ  THE  MAN  HIS  RIGHTS,
               I'LL BE OVER HERE BEING HAPPY.

     UNFORTUNATELY ... AS MURTAUGH SPEAKS, HE DOES NOT  SEE  THE
     MAN ON THE GROUND HAS A HIDEAWAY GUN TUCKED INTO HIS
     WAISTBAND. AS MURTAUGH TALKS, OBLIVIOUS ...  THE  GUY  TAKES
     OUT THE GUN WITH HIS GOOD ARM -- AND  AIMS  DEAD  CENTER-AT
     MURTAUGH'S BACK.  RIGGS, HOWEVER, NOTICES.  AND SPRINGS
     INTO ACTION. BEFORE THE RICH GUY CAN FIRE  ...  RIGGS'  FOOT
     FLASHES OUT LIKE A PILE DRIVER.  CRACK!  THE GUY FLIES
     BACKWARD. LANDS ON TOP  OF  THE  POOL  TARPAULIN.  OOPS.  IT
     PROMPTLY SURROUNDS HIM IN A SUCKING, VICE-LIKE GRIP.
     MURTAUGH DIVES FORWARD AND EXTENDS HIS HAND.  TOO LATE.
     THE VINYL SURROUNDS THE SCREAMING RICH GUY, SUCKS HIM
     BELOW THE SURFACE.  SMOTHERS HIM.

     DRAGS HIM TO THE BOTTOM.  MURTAUGH LOOKS ON, WILD-EYED.
     ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL IS A VINYL TOMB.  MURTAUGH
     DIVES IN. SWIMS TO THE  BOTTOM.  YANKS,  AND  STRAINS,  BUT
     WE ALL KNOW IT'S NO FUCKING USE.  THE  VINYL  STOPS  MOVING.
     MURTAUGH STARES... AND THEN HE GIVES  UP.  SURFACES  AT  THE
     SIDE OF THE POOL, GASPING AND WHEEZING.  RIGGS KNEELS
     DOWN BESIDE HIM.

                         RIGGS
               OOPS.

     MURTAUGH STARES DAGGERS AT HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               HAVE YOU ... EVER...  MET SOMEONE
               YOU DIDN'T KILL... ?

                         RIGGS
               HAVEN'T KILLED YOU YET.

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC, YOU WANT  A  LITTLE  GOLD
               STAR?
                    (LIE PULLS OUT
                     A SOAKED PACK
                     OF CIGARETTES)
               SHIT.

58   EXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOME - LATER                       58

     BEHIND RIGGS AND MURTAUGH, CRIME SCENE COPS SCURRY BACK
     AND FORTH.  FLASHING LIGHTS.  CAMERAS.  MURTAUGH MAKES
     HIS WAY TO THE CAR.  RIGGS BESIDE HIM.  AS THEY REACH
     THE CAR, MURTAUGH  STOPS:

                         MURTAUGH
               LOOK, I' M SORRY I SAID THAT SHIT
               BACK THERE.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU SAVED MY LIFE.  THANK YOU.

                         RIGGS
               I BET THAT HURT TO SAY.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

59   INT. MURTAUGH HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT                      59

     THE TWO DETECTIVES COME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR, SHEDDING
     THEIR JACKETS.  YOUNG CARRIE APPEARS, NURSING A POPSICLE.

                         CARRIE
               HI, DADDY.  IS THAT A CROOK?

                         MURTAUGH
               NO, HONEY, THIS IS MARTIN, MY
               PARTNER.
                    (SCOOPS HER UP;
                     HUGS HER)
               TELL MARTIN WHAT YOU THINK OF
               CROOKS.

                         CARRIE
               BUTTHEADS.
                    (GIGGLES)
               THEY'RE BUTTHEADS.

                         RIGGS
               KID'S NO DUMMY.

                         CARRIE
               DADDY, MOMMY SAYS YOU HATE HER
               COOKING.

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL MOMMY HATE IS A MILD WORD.

60   INT. KITCHEN                                               60

     TRISH IS COOKING AS THE TWO COPS ENTER.

                         MURTAUGH
               HI, HONEY.
                    (HE  LOOKS  IN
                     THE OVEN)
               WE'RE HAVING SOMETHING BROWN... A
               LARGISH BROWN OBJECT  ...

                         TRISH
               IT'S ROAST.

                         MURTAUGH
               DAMMIT, I WANTED TO GUESS.  HONENY,
               THIS IS MARTIN, MY NEW PARTNER.
               HE'LL BE JOINING US TONIGHT, OKAY?

                         TRISH
               SURE.  ROAST OKAY WITH YOU, MARTIN?

                         RIGGS
               FINE.

                         MURTAUGH
               HOW ABOUT BROWN, ROAST-LIKE
               SUBSTANCE?

                         TRISH
               ROGER, YOU'RE BEING AN ASSHOLE.
                    (KISSES  HIS  EAR)
               DON'T FORGET TO COMPLIMENT RIANNE
               ON HER SHOES.

                         MURTAUGH
               GOT  IT.  DRINK,  MARTIN?

                         RIGGS
               BOURBON, IF YOU HAVE IT.

     MURTAUGH EXITS.  RIGGS STANDS AWKWARDLY AS TRISH  REMOVES
     THE ROAST  FROM  THE  OVEN.

                         RIGGS
               MY WIFE COULD BURN WATER.

                         TRISH
               YOU'RE MARRIED?

                         RIGGS
               I WAS.  SHE'S  DEAD  NOW.

                         TRISH
               OH.  I'M SORRY.

                         RIGGS
               NO PROBLEM.

     HE REACHES FOR A STRAY PIECE OF ROAST.  TRISH SLAPS HIS
     HAND.

                         TRISH
               DON'T PICK.-

     RIGGS SMILES.  A GENUINE SMILE, THE FIRST WE'VE SEEN.

60A  INT. LIVING  ROOM  -  SAME                                   60A

     MURTAUGH IS FIXING DRINKS AS RIANNE ENTERS.  WE ALL
     HEAVE A SIGH.  SHE IS STRICTLY TO PERISH FOR.

                         RIANNE
               HELLO,   FATHER.

                         MURTAUGH
               HELLO, DAUGHTER.  NICE SHOES.

                         RIANNE
               OH, DADDY, AREN'T THEY GREAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               ABSOLUTELY.  HOW MUCH THEY COST?

                         RIANNE
               A HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS.  DO
               YOU REALLY LIKE THEM?

                         MURTAUGH
               A HUNDRED AND --
                   (FROWNS)
               -- THEY'RE SHOES.

                         RIANNE
               RIGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU WEAR THEM ON YOUR FEET.

                         RIANNE
               RIGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               AND THAT'S ALL THEY DO ... ?  THERE'S
               NOT, LIKE A TV INSIDE?

                         RIANNE
               NOPE.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (SHAKES HIS HEAD)
               I'M VERY OLD.

                                                  CUT TO:

61   INT. MURTAUGH'S DEN                                        61

     YOUNG NICK MURTAUGH IS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE TELE-
     VISION, WATCHING A "CHARLEY BROWN CHRISTMAS" AND COLOR-
     ING A PICTURE WITH A BIG BOX OF CRAYONS.  HE STOPS.
     FROWNS.  LOOKS UP -- AT MARTIN RIGGS, WHO IS PEEKING
     HIS HEAD AROUND THE CORNER, WATCHING WITH RAPT FASCINA-
     TION.  RIGGS CHUCKLES, POINTS TO THE SCREEN:

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS GOOD.  I LIKE THIS.

     NICK LOOKS AT HIM VERY STRANGELY.  OKAY, SO THE GUY
     LIKES CARTOONS ...

62   INT. DINING ROOM - MEALTIME                                62

     EVERYONE IS GATHERED, EATING.
     INCREDIBLY HOMEY AND DOMESTIC-LOOKING.
     FOR RIGGS, WHO EATS RAVENOUSLY, IT IS THE FIRST TASTE
     OF WARMTH IN MANY A LONG YEAR.

62A  ACROSS THE TABLE                                          62A

     WE NOTICE SOMETHING KIND OF NEAT:
     RIANNE SIMPLY CANNOT TAKE HER EYES OFF RIGGS.
     SHE STARES AT HIM, IN A TRANCE.  HER BROTHER NICK NUDGES
     HER IN THE RIBS.  SHE PULLS A FACE.

62B  MURTAUGH                                                  62B

     HAS ALSO NOTICED HIS DAUGHTER'S ATTENTIONS, AND YOU CAN
     BET HE'S NOT ALL THAT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

63.  EXT. MURTAUGH'S HOIJSE - DRIVEWAY - BOAT - NIGHT           63

     TIRSH MURTAUGH WHEELING GARBAGE PAIL TO CURBSIDE.

                         TRISH
                    (SARCASTICALLY)
               THAT'S OKAY, HONEY.  I'LL TAKE
               OUT THE GARBAGE.

     BOAT.  MURTAUGH'S HEAD APPEARS SHEEPISHLY FROM WITHIN.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  THANKS, HONEY.

     ON BOARD BOAT, MURTAUGH IS WORKING ON THE ENGINE.  RIGGS
     SITTING ON DRIVER'S SEAT.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHADDAYA THINK?

                         RIGGS
               YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BOATS,
               ROGER?

                         MURTAUGH
               KNOW HOW MUCH THEY COST.

                         RIGGS
               I MEAN, CAN YOU SAIL THIS THING?

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S  WRONG  WITH  YOU?  THIS  AIN'T
               A SAIL BOAT.

                         RIGGS
                    (SMILING)
               THAT'S  WHAT  I  THOUGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               NO TRICK  TO  IT.  THAT'S  THE  FRONT.
               THAT'S THE BACK.  WATER ALL AROUND.
               WHY YOU GOTTA MAKE THINGS SO
               COMPLICATED?

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T.  THAT'S JUST HOW THEY ARE.

     MURTAUGH OPENS AN ICE CHEST, TAKES A BEER FOR HIMSELF
     AND TOSSES  ONE  TO  RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, YEAH.  YOU MEAN AMANDA
               HUNSACKER'S    MURDER?

                         RIGGS
               NOW, DID I MENTION THAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU DON'T HAVE TO.  I CAN READ
               YOUR MIND.

     RIGGS MAKES NO REPLY.  HE JUST LOOKS AT MURTAUGH OVER
     THE RIM OF  HIS  BEER  CAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               I DON'T GET YOU, RIGGS.  WHAT'S THE
               PROBLEM? WE  GOT  ONE  DEAD  GIRL  AND
               ONE DEAD  GUY.  DEAD  GUY  KILLED  THE
               DEAD GIRL AND WE KILLED THE DEAD
               GUY 'CAUSE HE WANTED  US  TO  BE  DEAD
               GUYS.  SEEMS PRETTY EASY TO ME.

     RIGGS HAS WANDERED OVER TO THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  HE IN-
     SPECTS THE SWITCHES AND GAUGES.

                         MURTAUGH
               LOOK, HER SUGAR DADDY WAS DEALIN'
               DRUGS.  SHE SAID SOMETHIN'... OR
               DID SOMETHIN'... OR SAW SOMETHIN'
               SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE, AND HE PITCHED
               HER OFF THE BALCONY INTO THE SWEET
               BY-AN'-BY.
                    (BEAT)
               THAT'S WHY HE CAME  AT  US  TODAY
               WITH A SHOTGUN.

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T  KNOW.  SOUNDS  A  LITTLE
               TOO NEAT TO ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               OF COURSE IT'S NEAT.  AND WHAT'S
               WRONG WITH  NEAT?  I  LIKE  NEAT.

     RIGGS FLIPS A SWITCH AND THE MOTOR ROARS TO LIFE.
     MURTAUGH LEAPS UP.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY!  WATCH  WHAT  YOU'RE  DOIN'!

     MURTAUGH FUMBLES WITH THE SWITCHES IN A FUTILE EFFORT  TO
     TURN OFF THE ENGINE.  BUT RIGGS KNOWS EXACTLY WHICH
     SWITCH TO FLIP.

                         RIGGS
               LOOKIN' FOR THIS?

     HE SILENCES THE ENGINE.  MURTAUGH GLARES AT HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU ASSHOLE.

                         RIANNE
               HI, DAD...

     MURTAUGH JUMPS, STARTLED BY HIS DAUGHTER'S ARRIVAL.
     RIANNE AND RIGGS EXCHANGE A GLANCE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT IS  IT,  RIANNE?

                         RIANNE
               MARK WANTS TO TAKE ME  OUT  TO  A
               CLUB TOMORROW NIGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE GROUNDED -- YOU KNOW THAT.

                         RIANNE
               PLEASE, DADDY ...

                         MURTAUGH
               WHICH ONE IS MARK, ANYWAY?

                         RIANNE
               THE BLOND ONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, YEAH. THE  ONE  WITH  PITS  IN
               HIS  FACE.

                         RIANNE
               THOSE ARE DIMPLES.

                         MURTAUGH
               THOSE ARE PITS.  WHEN HE SMILES,
               I CAN SEE THROUGH HIS HEAD.
                    (BEAT)
               THE ANSWER IS NO.  END OF STORY.

                         RIGGS
               C'MON, ROG.  HAVE A HEART.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT RIGGS -- NOT APPRECIATIVE OF HIS
     INTERVENTION.

                         MURTAUGH
               THE GIRL WAS SMOKING  POT  IN  THE
               HOUSE.  SHE'S GROUNDED!

                        RIANNE
               NEXT TIME I'LL JUST  TAKE  A  BEER
               INSTEAD.  WHY CAN I HAVE  A  BEER
               AND NOT  A JOINT?  IT'S NOT COKE,
               YOU  KNOW, DAD.

     MURTAUGH  LOOKS  DOWN SHEEPISHLY AT THE CAN OF BEER IN HIS
     HAND.  RIGGS  GRINS  TO  HIMSELF.

                         MURTAUGH
               'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, BEER'S LEGAL AND
               GRASS AIN'T.  RIGHT OR WRONG.

                         RIANNE
               WRONG.

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.

     SHE STALKS OFF.  AFTER A MOMENT, MURTAUGH LOOKS OVER TO
     RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'VE LOST TRACK... DID WE RESOLVE
               ANYTHING  HERE  TONIGHT?

     RIGGS SHAKES HIS HEAD, SMILES AND STARTS TO CLIMB OFF
     THE BOAT.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.  WE RESOLVED THAT YOUR WIFE
               TAKES OUT  THE  GARBAGE.  YOUR
               DAUGHTER SMOKES POT, WHICH IS
               ILLEGAL BUT SHOULDN'T BE -- THAT
               YOU DON'T KNOW FROM BOATS, AND
               YOU GOT ONE HELL OF A FAMILY, GUY.

     WALKING TOWARDS TRUCK TOGETHER.

                         MURTAUGH
               THANKS.

                         RIGGS
               ENJOYED THE MEAL.

                         MURTAUGH
               BULLSHIT, BUT  THANKS  ANYWAY.

     A PAUSE.   RIGGS STANDS THERE.  THEN:

                         RIGGS
               YOU DON'T TRUST ME AT ALL, DO YOU?

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL YOU WHAT.  MAKE IT THROUGH
               TOMORROW WITHOUT KILLING ANYBODY.
               ESPECIALLY  ME.  OR  YOURSELF.
               THEN I'LL START TRUSTING YOU.

                         RIGGS
               FAIR ENOUGH.

     HE WALKS TOWARD HIS TRUCK.  STOPS.

                         RIGGS
               I DO IT REAL GOOD,  YOU  KNOW.

                         MURTAUGH
               DO WHAT?

                         RIGGS
               KILL PEOPLE ... ONLY THING I EVER
               DID GOOD.  WHEN I WAS NINETEEN, I
               DID A GUY IN LAOS FROM A THOUSAND
               YARDS OUT.
               RIFLE SHOT IN HIGH WIND.
                    (BEAT)
               TEN GUYS IN THE WORLD COULDA MADE
               THAT SHOT.  HUH.  ONLY THING I WAS
               EVER GOOD AT.
                    (PAUSE;  THEN)
               WELL, SEE YOU TOMORROW.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  SEE  YOU  THEN.

     RIGGS DRIVES  AWAY.  MURTAUGH  WATCHES  HIM.  TURNS.  ON  THE
     WAY BACK INSIDE, HE FLICKS ON THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

64   OMITTED                                                        64

65   EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT                                      65

     MARTIN RIGGS CRUISES ALONG IN HIS BATTERED PICKUP TRUCK
     PAST ALL-NIGHT DIVES AND PORNO HOUSES.  THE STREETS ARE
     NEARLY DESERTED.  EXCEPT FOR A YOUNG HOOKER ON THE COR-
     NER.  REAL YOUNG, MAYBE SEVENTEEN.  RIGGS SEES HER AND
     PULLS OVER TO THE CURB.  THE HOOKER APPROACHES.

                         HOOKER
               HI, HANDSOME.  LOOKING FOR
               SOMETHING?

                         RIGGS
               AREN'T  WE  ALL?

                         HOOKER
                    (NODS)
               ARE YOU AFFILIATED WITH ANY LAW
               ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION?

                         RIGGS
                    (PAUSE;  THEN)
               NO. GET  IN  THE  CAR.

     SHE DOES.  CLOSES THE DOOR.

                         RIGGS
               HOW OLD ARE YOU?

                         HOOKER
               TWENTY-TWO.

                         RIGGS
               BULLSHIT.

                         HOOKER
               WHY, YOU LIKE 'EM YOUNG?

                         RIGGS
               YOUNGER THE BETTER.  HOW OLD ARE
               YOU?

                         HOOKER
                    (ALMOST SHYLY)
               SIXTEEN.

     RIGGS NODS.  TAKES OUT A HUNDRED-DOLLAR BILL AND SETS IT
     IN HER  LAP.

                         HOOKER
               WOW.
                    (BEAT)
               SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

                         RIGGS
               I WANT YOU TO COME HOME AND
               WATCH TELEVISION WITH ME.

     HE DRIVES AWAY FROM THE CURB.

66   INT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT                                 66

     THE HOUSE IS DARK AND QUIET AT THIS HOUR.  ROGER MURTAUGH
     FIXES A SANDWICH IN THE KITCHEN.  RICKLES THE CAT PURRS,
     RUBS AGAINST HIS LEG.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY.

     HE KICKS IT ASIDE.  NOTICES A PACKAGE ON THE COUNTER,
     TOGETHER WITH A SCRIBBLED CRAYON NOTE:

     HAPPY BIRTHDAY SERGEANT MURTAUGH

     THE GIFT IS A 99C SPECIAL, RIGHT OFF THE RACK AT PIC N'
     SAVE:  THE TUFF N' READY POLICE ACTION PLAYSET; TINY
     PLASTIC GUN, MADE IN TAIWAN.  TINY PLASTIC BADGE.
     MURTAUGH SMILES.  NOTICES ANOTHER PACKAGE NEXT TO IT.
     FROWNS.  ITS LABEL READS:  ROGER MURTAUGH:  POLICE
     EVIDENCE.

67   INT. LIVING ROOM                                            67

     HE OPENS THE PACKAGE. TWO  THINGS:  A  HIGH  SCHOOL  YEAR-
     BOOK; ALSO A VIDEOCASSETTE. TAKES IT,  SLIDES  IT  INTO  A
     VCR MACHINE.  TURNS ON THE TELEVISION.

                                          TIME CUT  TO:

67A  INT./EXT. RIGGS' TRAILER - NIGHT                             67A

     THE HOOKER WATCHES TV -- REALLY ENJOYING THE THREE
     STOOGES. RIGGS STANDS APART  FROM  HER.  HE'S  NOT  WATCH-
     ING TV; HE'S WATCHING HER WATCHING TV.

     HE WEARS A MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION. THE  WORLD  IS  FULL  OF
     HAPPY FAMILIES LIKE MURTAUGH'S, BUT HE HAS TO GET BY
     LIKE THIS.

     HIS EYES SHIFT TO A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE.  HE PICKS IT UP
     AND VIEWS IT SADLY.

                         HOOKER
                    (TURNING TO HIM)
               YOU'RE NOT HAVING A VERY GOOD
               TIME,  ARE  YOU?

     RIGGS PUTS DOWN THE PHOTO.

                         RIGGS
                    (SWEETLY)
               YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.  MAYBE THIS
               IS HOW I LOOK WHEN I'M HAVING A
               GOOD TIME.  MAYBE I'M HAVING THE
               BEST TIME OF MY LIFE.

                         HOOKER
                    (AFTER A BEAT)
               ARE YOU?

     RIGGS DOESN'T ANSWER.

                         HOOKER
               I KNOW... SING ME SOMETHING.

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T SING.

                         HOOKER
               COME ON.  SING ME A SONG.

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T KNOW ANY SONGS.

                         HOOKER
               NOT EVEN A CHRISTMAS SONG?
               EVERYBODY KNOWS A CHRISTMAS SONG.

     RIGGS SHRUGS AND MAKES A HALF-HEARTED ATTEMPT:

                         RIGGS
               SOMETHING THROUGH THE SNOW,
               IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH ...

                         HOOKER
               GOOD.  THAT'S   GOOD.
                    (HELPS HIM OUT)
               OVER THE HILLS WE GO,
               LAUGHING ALL THE WAY.

                         RIGGS
               SOMETHING SOMETHING RING,
               MAKING SOMETHING BRIGHT ...

                         HOOKER
               OH, WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE ...

                         RIGGS
               TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE TONIGHT!

     THEY KNOW THEY GOT IT WRONG,  BUT  THEY'RE  PLEASED  WITH
     THEMSELVES JUST THE SAME.  THE HOOKER HUGS RIGGS IMPUL-
     SIVELY.  RIGGS LOOKS UNCOMFORTABLE.  HE'D LIKE TO SHOW
     HER SOME PLATONIC AFFECTION, BUT HE KNOWS THAT'S
     IMPOSSIBLE.

     HE GENTLY UNWRAPS HER ARMS FROM AROUND HIS NECK.

                         RIGGS
               I BETTER TAKE YOU BACK NOW.

68   SAME PLACE - LITTLE  BIT  LATER                                 68

     MURTAUGH IS IN FRONT OF THE TV. ON  HIS  LAP  IS  A  HIGH
     SCHOOL YEARBOOK.  OPEN TO THE MIDDLE.  HE GLANCES DOWN,
     SEES -- A PHOTOGRAPH OF AMANDA LLOYD.  SENIOR PICTURE.
     SMILING.  YOUNG.  THE GIRL MOST LIKELY TO.  HE LOOKS UP
     UP AT THE TELEVISION.  ON THE SCREEN AMANDA LLOYD IS
     WRITHING  IN  ECSTASY.  SMILING.  MURTAUGH  CONTINUES  TO
     WATCH.  LIGHTS ANOTHER CIGARETTE.  THERE IS A SAD,
     FARAWAY LOOK ON HIS FACE.

                                              CUT TO:

69   INT. HALLWAY                                                    69

     VERY LATE NOW. MURTAUGH WALKS DOWN  THE  HALL  TO  A  BEDROOM
     DOOR.  OPENS IT A FRACTION.  INSIDE -- HIS DAUGHTER
     RIANNE IS ASLEEP.

     A SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT FALLS ACROSS THE BED.  SHE IS MORE
     BEAUTIFUL THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN HER.

     MURTAUGH CROSSES TO THE BED, LEANS DOWN, AND KISSES  HER
     FOREHEAD.  SHE STIRS IN HER SLEEP, SMILES LIKE A CAT,
     AND WHISPERS:

                         RIANNIE
               ... MARK ...

     MURTAUGH RECOILS. STANDS UP. WE REALIZE  THAT  UP  UNTIL
     THIS MOMENT, SEE, HE THOUGHT SHE WAS MAYBE A VIRGIN ...

70   INT. MURTAUGH'S BEDROOM                                    70

     HE TAKES OFF HIS ROBE, DRAPES IT ON A CHAIR.  GETS  INTO
     BED SILENTLY NEXT TO HIS SLEEPING WIFE.  LIES AWAKE,
     STARING UP AT THE CEILING.  THE RAIN BEATS ON THE WINDOW,
     THROWING ODD SHADOWS ACROSS HIS FACE. HE  DRIFTS  TOWARD
     SLEEP.  AS HE DOES, WE EVER SO SLOWLY ...

                                            CROSS FADE TO:

71   INT. MURTAUGH BEDROOM                                      71

     SUNLIGHT STREAMS THROUGH THE WINDOWS, MURTAUGH STIRS
     GROGGILY, FORCES OPEN HIS EYES.  STARING HIM IN THE FACE
     IS MARTIN RIGGS' SCRUFFY, EARLY MORNING  FACE.  MURTAUGH
     FROWNS.

                         MURTAUGH
               ... MARTIN...  ?

                         RIGGS
               GOOD MORNING, ROGER.  I'VE BEEN
               DOING A LITTLE THINKING.

     MURTAUGH JUST STARES AT HIM.

                         RIGGS
               ABOUT THE NIGHT AMANDA HUNSAK.ER
               DIED.

     MURTAUGH GRIMACES.

                         MURTAUGH
               DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS ... ?

                         RIGGS
               DAY TIME?

                         MURTAUGH
               I'LL GET DRESSED.

                                       CUT TO:

72   INT. MURTAUGH KITCHEN                            72

     IN THE KITCHEN TRISH IS SINGING SOMETHING BLUESY, FIXING
     COFFEE.  AT THE TABLE NICK IS DRINKING MILK.  MURTAUGH
     SITS.  RIGGS TAKES OFF HIS SHOULDER HOLSTER, AND WITH
     METICULOUS CARE DRAPES IT DELICATELY OVER THE BACK OF
     HIS CHAIR.  SITS OPPOSITE MURTAUGH.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE SERIOUSLY USING KETCHUP?

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.

                         RIGGS
               ON EGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.
                    (BEAT)
               WHO MADE THE KETCHUP?

                         RIGGS
               HEINZ.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHO MADE THE EGGS?

     RIGGS LOOKS TO TRISH.
                         TRISH
                    (ACROSS THE ROOM)
               YOU TWO ARE SO HILARIOUS I COULD
               BUST.

     RIGGS LEANS FORWARD.

                         RIGGS
               ROGER.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.

                         RIGGS
               THAT HOOKER WHO WITNESSED THE
               JUMP THE OTHER NIGHT.  WHAT WAS

     THEY STRUGGLE TO BE HEARD OVER THE TUMULT:

                         RIGGS
               TELL HER THAT.

     RIGGS STEPS TO THE LINE.  DRAWS THE BERETTA, FIRES OFF
     A FULL CLIP.  THREE-SHOT RHYTHMS, TWO IN THE CHEST, ONE
     IN THE HEAD, TWO IN THE CHEST, ONE IN THE HEAD.
     REMOVES THE MAGAZINES LOVINGLY SNAPS IN A NEW ONE.

                         MURTAUGH

                         MURTAUGH
               HERE, STAND BACK.

     MURTAUGH STEPS TO THE RED LINE.  STRETCHES.  CRACKS HIS
     NECK.  SHIFTS FROM FOOT TO FOOT.  FINALLY STEADIES HIM-
     SELF.  A MOMENT THEN:  HE CROSS-DRAWS WITH LIGHTNING
     SWIFTNESS.  -- BANG -- !  THE REPORT IS DEAFENING.  THE
     TARGET GROWS A NEAT THIRD EYE.  PERFECT SHOT.  DEAD
     CENTER.  MURTAUGH GRINS, HOLSTERS HIS GUN.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY-HEY.  WOULD'JA LOOK AT THAT?
               PRETTY GOOD FOR AN OLD MAN.

     RIGGS SHRUGS.  DRAWS.  FIRES.  HE ISN'T EVEN LOOKING.

     NONETHELESS. -- HE PUTS A MAGNUM ROUND RIGHT THROUGH
     THE HOLE MADE BY MURTAUGH'S .38.  THE HOLE GETS .60
     INCHES WIDER.  MURTAUGH SCOWLS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH, YEAH.  EAT ME.

     HE STALKS AWAY, PISSED OFF.

75   EXT. WEST L.A. STREET - MORNING                           75

     MURTAUGH'S CAR GLIDES UP TO THE CURB.  IN FRONT OF A
     ROW OF NEAT FRAME HOUSES.  OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.  LATE MODEL
     CARS.  A LITTLE BLACK KID PLAYING ON THE SIDEWALK.

     THE TWO COPS GET OUT, STRIDE TOWARD A  COTTAGE  SET  BACK
     FROM THE STREET.  THEY PASS THE LITTLE KID WHO IS PLAYING
     WITH A PLASTIC BUCKET AND A HEADLESS  STAR  WARS  FIGURE.

                         RIGGS
               HEY, KID.  WHAT'CHA DOING?

     THE KID GRINS, OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF.

                         LITTLE KID
               I PUT THIS ON TOP AND IT FALL
               DOWN.

     HE DEMONSTRATES.  HE PUTS IT  ON  TOP.  IT  FALLS  DOWN.  HE
     GRINS HAPPILY.  RIGGS SHAKES HIS HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               GOOD THINKING.

     THEY KEEP WALKING.  TOWARD THE COTTAGE.

                         MURTAUGH
               VERY THIN.

                         RIGGS
               PROBABLY NOTHING.

     THEY MOUNT THE STEPS TO THE WALK.  AS THEY DO -- THE
     HOUSE SUDDENLY EXPLODES.  IT  BLOWS  APART  CONCUSSIVELY.
     THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT, A LOUD, FLAT BANG --!  AND THE
     THING TEARS TO PIECES.  GLASS  BLOWS  OUT.  WOOD  SPRAYS.
     FLYING SHRAPNEL.  A WALL OF  FLAME.  RIGGS  HITS  THE  DIRT,
     SMOTHERING THE LITTLE BLACK KID.  MURTAUGH DIVES FOR COVER
     BEHIND A TELEPHONE POLE. A PIECE  OF  SHRAPNEL  IMBEDS  IT-
     SELF; RIGHT NEXT TO HIS HEAD.  CARNAGE.  NOISE.  THE
     TUMULT SLOWLY BEGINS TO  FADE.  ECHOES.  FLAMES  RAGE  TO
     THE SKY.  SMOKE ROLLS.  BEAMS COLLAPSE.  THE COTTAGE IS
     NO MORE.  MURTAUGH CLIMBS TO HIS FEET, DAZED; STARES AT
     THE RUBBLE.  LOOKS OVER TOWARD RIGGS, WHO IS GETTING
     UP OFF THE KID.  THE KID IS SHAKEN, BUT UNHURT.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY.

     RIGGS TURNS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE ON FIRE.

     RIGGS LOOKS. THE BACK OF HIS  COAT  IS  COMPLETELY  ABLAZE.

                         RIGGS
               SHIT.

     HE TAKES IT OFF, FLINGS IT ASIDE.

     GOES UP TO MURTAUGH-  LIGHTS A CIGARETTE.

                         RIGGS
               PROBABLY NOTHING.

     COPS PROWL THROUGH THE GUTTED REMAINS.  CHARRED AND
     BLACK. NOTHING LEFT.  A BODY GOES BY ON A STRETCHER.
     MURTAUGH STOPS IT.

               HO.

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY, OKAY.

     THE STRETCHER CONTINUES TOWARD THE WAITING TRUCK.
     MURTAUGH LOOKS OFF,  WHISPERS:

               SIR, I THINK YOU'D BETTER COME

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH STAND BY THE REAR OF THE TRUCK.  A

     IDLING SOFTLY.  NEXT TO THEM SITS THE LITTLE BLACKKID

     HOVERS ...

               I SAW HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               GREAT.  LISTEN, YOU EVER WATCH
               'STARSKY AND  HUTCH'?  'CAUSE  THE
               POLICE, SOMETIMES THEY NEED HELP.
               THEY NEED POLICE HELPERS.

                     A PLASTIC BADGE,
                     PUTS IT ON
                     ALFRED'S CHEST)
               IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN BE  A  JUNIOR
               DETECTIVE.  IF YOU WANT.

     THE KID LOOKS  AT  HIM.  DISTRUST.

                         MURTAUGH
               KEEP IT, IT'S YOURS.  OFFICIAL
               DETECTIVE.

     ALFRED NODS, GRINS.

                         MURTAUGH
               THE MAN AT THE METER.  CAN YOU ...
               PICTURE HIM IN  YOUR  HEAD?  THINK
               ABOUT WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.  GOT
               IT ?

     ALFRED NODS.  MURTAUGH PICKS UP ALFRED'S BOX OF CRAYONS.
     HANDS IT TO THE LITTLE BOY.

                         MURTAUGH
               I WANT YOU TO DRAW HIM FOR ME.

                         ALFRED
               I'M A GOOD DRAWER.

                         MURTAUGH
               TRY TO DRAW THE MAN.

    RIGGS CLEARS HIS THROAT.  ROLLS HIS EYES.

                         RIGGS
               OH, BROTHER.  THIS IS GOOD.  I LIKE
               THIS.

                         MURTAUGH
               CAN IT, MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               WE'RE GONNA PUT OUT AN A.P.B. ON BIG
               BIRD.

                         MURTAUGH
               VERY FUNNY.

                         RIGGS
                    (LAUGHS)
               ATTENTION ALL UNITS.  LARGE YELLOW
               BIRD.   SILLY   VOICE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE HILARIOUS.  ALFRED, DRAW THE
               MAN, OKAY?

     ALFRED NODS, TAKES THE CRAYONS, AND CAREFULLY SELECTS A
     BUNCH OF COLORS.  LAYS THEM OUT LIKE DA VINCI FIXING HIS
     PALETTE.  RIGGS  SHAKES   HIS   HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               BRILLIANT POLICE WORK?  I THINK SO.

                                               TIME CUT:

79   ANOTHER ANGLE                                          79

     MINUTES HAVE PASSED.

                         MURTAUGH
               MARTIN, HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

     RIGGS CROSSES.  ALFRED HAS FINISHED HIS DRAWING, AND
     GUESS WHAT?  IT'S HILARIOUSLY BAD.  LIKE A SIX-YEAR-OLD
     DREW IT OR SOMETHING.  RIGGS RUBS HIS EYES.

                         RIGGS
               OH, MY ...
                    (BEGINS TO
                     LAUGH)
               ... OH, MY...

     HE LAUGHS EVEN HARDER NOW.  MURTAUGH SCOWLS,
     SNATCHES THE PICTURE AWAY.

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC.  VERY PROFESSIONAL.

     RIGGS IS HOOTING.  MURTAUGH SHOWS THE PICTURE TO ALFRED.

                         ALFRED
               HE LAUGH AT MY PICTURE.

                         MURTAUGH
               SHHH.  DON'T MIND HIM.  HE'S
               CRAZY.

                         ALFRED
               I'M A GOOD DRAWER.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU BET.
                    (POINTS)
               ALFRED.  THIS IS ... THE MAN'S ARM,
               RIGHT?

                         ALFRED
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY.  NOW THIS MARK.  IS THIS ...
               WHAT IS THIS?

                         ALFRED
               HE HAD IT ON HIS ARM.

     RIGGS STOPS LAUGHING.  MOVES IN CLOSER.

                         RIGGS
               WHOA.  WHAT WAS ON HIS ARM?

                         MURTAUGH
               WAS IT A BIRTHMARK?
                    (POINTS TO
                      HIS ARM)
               WAS IT LIKE THIS?

                         ALFRED
               NO.  IT  WAS   PAINED.

                         MURTAUGH
               PAINED.

                         RIGGS
               PAINED, PAINED.  WHAT'S HE SAYING?

                         MURTAUGH
               SSSSHH.
                    (BEAT)
               IT WAS ... PAINTED?

                         ALFRED
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               LIKE  A  TATTOO?
                    (BEAT)
               DO YOU  WATCH  POPEYE?  WAS  IT  A
               TATTOO LIKE POPEYE HAS?

     RIGGS ROLLS UP HIS SLEEVE, EXPOSES HIS MARINE TATTOO.
     YOU'VE SEEN THE TYPE:  A TWEETY BIRD WITH A MACHINE GUN,
     OR SOME SUCH.

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS A TATTOO.

     THE BOY'S EYES GO WIDE ONCE AGAIN.  HE POINTS AT RIGGS' ARM.

                         ALFRED
               IT WAS THAT.

     THE  COPS  STOP,  PUZZLED.

                         MURTAUGH
               IT  WAS  THAT?  YOU  MEAN...  JUST
               LIKE  THAT...?

                         ALFRED
               YEAH.  MAN  HAD  THE  SAME  THING.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE SURE?

     ALFRED  NODS.  THE  COPS  EXCHANGE   GLANCES:

                         RIGGS
               SPECIAL FORCES TATTOO ... ?

                         MURTAUGH
               MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT THE HELL ARE WE INTO HERE ... ?

80   EXT. CLIFFSIDE HOUSE - DAY                                    80

     A SPRAWLING, EXPENSIVE VILLA NESTLED ON THE SIDE  OF  A
     BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE  OCEAN.  TERRACES,  VERANDAHS,
     GAZEBOS.  ARCHITECTURE THAT MERITS THREE SYLLABLES.  THE
     OCEAN LOOKS CHEAP BY COMPARISON.  A MEMORIAL SERVICE IS
     IN PROGRESS.  A GROUP OF PEOPLE, MOSTLY YOUNG, FRIENDS
     OF AMANDA LLOYD; ALL ARE DRESSED IN  FUNERAL  BLACK.

81   NEARBY --                                                    81

     MARTIN RIGGS IS COLLAPSED IN A LAWN  CHAIR,  SMOKING AND
     LOOKING THOROUGHLY OUT OF PLACE.  SEEING  THE  GIRL, HE
     FROWNS ... PUFFS ON HIS CIGARETTE, AND ROLLS A  QUARTER
     OVER HIS KNUCKLES LIKE A  STAGE  MAGICIAN.  NIMBLE,  TRAINED
     FINGERS.  A THOROUGHLY UNCONSCIOUS HABIT.

82   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 82

     DICK LLOYD LOOKS WORSE THAN EVER.  HE  STANDS,  STARING
     OUT OVER THE OCEAN -- AS A HAND COMES OUT OF NOWHERE ...
     GRABS HIS SHOULDER, AND SPINS HIM ROUGHLY AROUND:  FACE-
     TO-FACE WITH ROGER MURTAUGH.  EYES BURNING LIKE COLD FIRE.

                         MURTAUGH
               HI, GUY.

                         LLOYD
               ROGER... WHAT ... WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

                         MURTAUGH
               NOT MUCH.
                     (BEAT)
               WANNA TELL ME ABOUT IT?

                         LLOYD
               TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T BULLSHIT ME.  THAT'S OVER.
                    (BEAT)
               YOUR DAUGHTER WASN'T KILLED
               BECAUSE OF SOMETHING SHE WAS INTO.
               SHE WAS KILLED BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
               YOU'RE INTO.  STOP ME IF I'M WRONG.

                         LLOYD
               I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
               ABOUT.  ROGER, I ...

                         MURTAUGH
               KEEP YOUR HANDS IN FRONT.

                         LLOYD
                    (STOPS;
                     STARTLED)
               HEY.  TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               FUCK EASY.
                    (BEAT)
               WHEN YOU CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY,
               YOU WERE GONNA BLOW THE WHISTLE,
               WEREN'T YOU?

                         LLOYD
               BLOW THE WHISTLE ON WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU TELL ME.  YOU WERE GONNA SPILL
               YOUR GUTS.  SO THEY KILLED YOUR
               DAUGHTER.  TELL ME I'M WRONG.

     LLOYD SWALLOWS HARD, FLUSTERED.  HE CAN'T MEET MURTAUGH'S
     EYES.

                         MURTAUGH
               TALK TO ME.

                         LLOYD
               CAN'T ... CAN'T DO THAT ...

                         MURTAUGH
               THEY KILLED YOUR DAUGHTER.

                         LLOYD
               I...

                        MURTAUGH
               THEY PAID OFF A HOOKER TO POISON
               YOUR DAUGHTER.  TALK TO ME!

     LLOYD SHOOTS A DESPERATE GLANCE ACROSS THE LAWN.  AT HIS
     OTHER DAUGHTER, AMANDA'S TWIN.

                         LLOYD
               DAMMIT,  ROGER,   I'VE...   VE  O
               ANOTHER DAUGHTER!

                         MURTAUH
               SHE'LL BE PROTECTED.
                    (BEAT)
               IT'S OVER, PAL.

                         LLOYD
               PROTECTED.  THAT'S A LAUGH... YOU
               DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

                         MURTAUGH
               ACQUAINT ME.

                                             TIME CUT:

83   INT. LLOYD'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                        83

     THE TWO MEN ARE INSIDE NOW.  THE SUNLIGHT FILTERS IN
     THROUGH A LARGE PICTURE WINDOW FROM THE LAWN.

     LLOYD IS PACING BACK AND FORTH.   HE TOUCHES HIS STOMACH
     IN THE CLASSIC GESTURE OF ULCER-CARRIERS EVERYWHERE.
     OPENS THE FRIDGE, REMOVES A CARTON OF MILK.  THERE MUST
     BE THREE CASES OF THE STUFF.  DRINKS, TURNS TO MURTAUGH.
     A MAN AT THE  END  OF  HIS  ROPE:

                         LLOYD
               IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE
               WAR.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M   LISTENING.

                         LLOYD
               I ENDED UP WORKING FOR A GROUP
               CALLED AIR AMERICA.  C.I.A. FRONT,
               SECRETLY RAN THE ENTIRE WAR OUT OF
               LAOS.  I WAS PART OF A SPECIAL
               UNIT CALLED SHADOW COMPANY.  MERCS.
               TRAINED KILLERS.  WHEN CHARLEY WAS
               BRINGING IN HEROIN TO FINANCE THE
               V.C. GOVERNMENT, SHADOW COMPANY
               WENT IN AND BURNED IT ALL DOWN.  WE
               KILLED EVERYBODY.  BUT WE ALSO ...
               FORMED  A  PLAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               KEEP TALKING.

                         LLOYD
               COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, SHADOW COMPANY
               GOT TOGETHER AGAIN.  THE  WAR  WAS
               OVER, BUT WE STILL HAD A  LIST  OF
               SOURCES.  IN ASIA.

                         MURTAUGH
               AND ... ?

                         LLOYD
               AND WE'VE BEEN BRINGING IT IN EVER
               SINCE.

                         MURTAUGH
               BRINGING WHAT IN?

                         LLOYD
               THINK REAL HARD.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEROIN.

                         LLOYD
                    (NODS)
               TWO SHIPMENTS A YEAR.  RUN BY
               EX-C.I.A.  SOLDIERS, MERCS.  NO
               ONE KNOWS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU SON OF  A  BITCH.

     LLOYD DOES NOT REPLY.  A PAUSE, THEN:

                         MURTAUGH
               IF YOU WERE GETTING COLD FEET,
               WHY'D THEY KILL  AMANDA?  WHY  NOT
               JUST  KILL  YOU?

                         LLOYD
               THEY CAN'T.  THEY NEED ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHY?

                         LLOYD
               MY BANK.  IT'S  THE  FRONT.  MAKES
               EVERYTHING LOOK GOOD ON THE TAX
               REPORT.

                         MURTAUGH
               THE TAX REPORT ... ?

                         LLOYD
               THIS IS BIG BUSINESS, ROGER.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (ICE COLD)
               NOT ANY MORE.  I'M GONNA BURN
               IT DOWN.

                         LLOYD
               YOU CAN'T.  IT'S  TOO  BIG.  THESE
               GUYS ARE TRAINED KILLERS.

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL ME ABOUT THE  NEXT  SHIPMENT.

                         LLOYD
               NO.  NO WAY.

     MURTAUGH GRABS A FRAMED PICTURE OF AMANDA, SLAMS IT
     DOWN ON A WOODEN BUL--CHER BLOCK.  THE GLASS SHATTERS.
     LLOYD STARES.

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL ME!!!

     LLOYD FLINCHES.  LEANS BACK, A DREAMY LOOK IN HIS EYES.
     SPEAKS FROM VERY FAR AWAY ...

                         LLOYD
                    (SOFTLY)
               NOTHING ... WRONG WITH THE KIDS,
               ROGER. WE'RE  ALL  FUCKED  UP.  US
               OLD BASTARDS ... WE'RE KILLING THEM.

     AND SUDDENLY THERE IS A GUN IN HIS HAND.  AIMED AT MURTAUGH.

                         LLOYD
               BACK OFF.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, SWELL.  GOOD MOVE.

                         LLOYD
               I'M NOT KIDDING. I'M  IN  TOO  FAR
               NOW.

     MURTAUGH DOES NOT BUDGE.  LLOYD COCKS THE HAMMER.

                         LLOYD
               THE GUN IS SILENCED, ROGER.

     MURTAUGH STARES HIM DOWN.  EYES  LIKE  FIRE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, BUDDY ... ?
               YOU GONNA SAVE MY LIFE, JUST SO
               YOU CAN SNUFF ME TWENTY YEARS
               LATER...?

                         LLOYD
               THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

                         MURTAUGH
               I GUESS.

     A MOMENT. LLOYD STARES INTENTLY.  FINGER  SWEATING  ON  THE
     TRIGGER.

                         MURTAUGH
               IF YOU CAN DO IT, DO IT.  I DON'T
               FUCKING CARE ANYMORE.

     LLOYD BLINKS. SWALLOWS.  ANOTHER  MOMENT.  FINALLY  --  HE
     LOWERS THE GUN.  SIGHS.

                         LLOYD
               ... WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW... ?

     MURTAUGH RELAXES VISIBLY. AND THAT'S  WHEN  TWO  THINGS
     HAPPEN. THE PICTURE WINDOW  GLASS  SUDDENLY  COLLAPSES.
     FALLS TINKLING INTO A MILLION SHARDS. AND  THE  CARTON  OF
     MILK IN LLOYD'S HAND POPS, SPURTING MILK ALL  OVER  THE
     FRONT OF HIS BLACK SUIT.  HE FROWNS.  STARES AT THE
     DRIBBLING MILK. BLINKS. AND HIS EYES  SNAP  OPEN  WIDE,  AS
     BLOOD SEEPS OUT OF HIS SHIRT, SPATTERING THE FLOOR.

                         LLOYD
               ROGER -- !

     WITH HIS DYING BREATH, HE LEAPS IN FRONT  OF  MURTAUGH.
     TAKES THE SECOND BULLET. THE ONE  MEANT  FOR  MURTAUGH.
     IT BLOWS HIM INTO ROGER, TAKES THEM BOTH TO THE  FLOOR  IN
     A BREATH-CRUSHING IMPACT. MORE BULLETS  CHOP  THE  KITCHEN.
     CHINA PLATES BURST INTO A GLASSY SPRAY.  FOOD SPATTERS
     AND GUSHES, STAINING THE WALLS.  MURTAUGH  ROLLS  FREE,
     THEN, A MAN POSSESSED:  SCREAMS OUT THE WINDOW:

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGGS!!!

84   EXT. LAWN                                                       84

     MURTAUGH'S VOICE IS FAR AWAY.  RIGGS LOOKS UP FROM HIS
     LAWN CHAIR. NOTICES  TWO  THINGS:  ONE:  EVERYTHING  SEEMS
     NORMAL. NOBODY HAS HEARD THE  SHOTS.  TWO:  THE  GLASS  IN
     THE KITCHEN WINDOW... SOMETHING STRANGE, WHAT THE HELL
     IS IT ... OH, YEAH, IT'S  BROKEN, SOMEONE BROKE THE GLASS ...
     AND RIGGS IS ON HIS FEET IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

85   BACK INSIDE                                                      85

     MURTAUGH IS AT THE WINDOW.  GUN POINTED.

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGGS!!!

86   MURTAUGH'S POV                                                  86

     REVEALS A CROWD OF PEOPLE, MILLING BACK AND FORTH, HE
     HAS NO IDEA WHERE THE SNIPER IS,  AND  SUDDENLY  BAM  --  !
     THE WOOD BLOWS OUT NOT TWO INCHES  FROM  HIS  HEAD  AND  HE
     DUCKS, AND MEANWHILE -- BACK OUTSIDE ...

87   MARTIN RIGGS                                                     87

     HE'S ON THE MOVE. HE JOGS ... TROTS ... RUNS ...  NOTICING  A
     LONE MAN IN BLACK, STRIDING QUICKLY ACROSS THE LAWN,
     STRIDING INTO THE CROWD ... TOWARD THE EDGE OF  THE  BLUFF  ...
     THINGS HAPPEN FAST NOW, PAY ATTENTION, AS -- THE MAN
     TURNS, SEES RIGGS ... RIGGS SEES HIM... AND THE MAN IS
     NONE OTHER THAN MR. JOSHUA.  CREW CUT.  SUNGLASSES.
     MOVING FAST.

88   MURTAUGH                                                         88

     DIVING OUT THE WINDOW.  HITS.  ROLLS, COMES UP.  SCREAM-
     ING, WAVING AT RIGGS ...

89   RIGGS                                                            89

     GUN OUT ... MOVING FAST,  SHOVING  THROUGH  THE  CROWD,  PEOPLE
     SCREAMING NOW, "JESUS, HE'S GOT A GUN -- !" RUNNING
     ACROSS THE LAWN,  MURTAUGH  THIRTY  YARDS  BEHIND,  MOVING,
     HARD AND FAST,  BOTH  GUNS  DRAWN,  PUSHING/SHOVING,  KNOCK-
     ING PEOPLE ASS OVER TEACUPS AND MEANWHILE LET US NOT
     FORGET --

90   JOSHUA                                                          90

     MOVING AT A DEAD RUN, NOW, GUN OUT ... AT THE EDGE OF THE
     CLIFF. PEOPLE ALL  AROUND  HIM,  CONFUSED,  I  MEAN  JESUS,
     WHAT THE HELL IS ALL  THIS  SHOOTING  ABOUT,  AND  RIGGS  CAN'T
     GET A CLEAR SHOT ... HE'S SWEEPING THE  GUN,  BACK  AND  FORTH,
     BODIES CROSSING IN FRONT OF HIM... ALL THE WRONG BODIES,
     GODDAMMIT...!  MOVING FORWARD, SHOUTING:

                         RIGGS
               LIE DOWN!!!  DOWN!!!

     MURTAUGH, SPRINGING HELL BENT  FOR  LEATHER  --  AND  FOLKS,
     GRAB YOUR HATS ... BECAUSE JUST THEN,  A  BELL  COBPA  HELI-
     COPTER CRESTS THE EDGE OF THE BLUFF.

     AN EXPLOSION OF SOUND...
     AS IT RISES LIKE AN AVENGING ANGEL ...
     HOVERS, SHATTERING THE AIR WITH TURBO-THROB, SANDBLASTING
     THE HILLSIDE WITH A ROTO-WASH OF LOOSE DIRT, TABLES,
     CHAIRS, EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT NAILED DOWN ...

     SCREAMING, CHAOS, FRENZY.
     THREE WORDS THAT APPLY TO THIS SCENE.

     AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS -- JOSHUA STEPS ONTO THE
     CHOPPER AND IS HAULED INSIDE.
     NO EXPRESSION.
     THE TOTAL PROFESSIONAL.
     AND THEN, MY FRIENDS, IT'S BYE-BYE TIME.  THE CHOPPER
     ROARS LIKE A BEHEMOTH, TILTS --
     SLIPS OVER THE SIDE AND PLUMMETS AWAY ...

     SLICK.  VERY SLICK.
     EXCEPT MARTIN RIGGS IT NOT IMPRESSED.

     HE'S STILL RUNNING, YOU SEE ...
     DIVES FLAT AT THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF, NEARLY FLINGS
     HIMSELF OVER THE DAMN EDGE ...
     GUN EXTENDED LIKE IT'S PART OF HIS ARM...
     FINGER FLAT ON THE TRIGGER ...
     BLOWING SHOT AFTER SHOT AT THE RETREATING CHOPPER ...
     BAM-BAM-BAM        HIS FACE CONTORTED IN A RICTUS OF
     ANIMAL CONCENTRATION...

     AND HE WINGS THE CHOPPER, EVEN.  POP
     SPRAY OF FIBERGLASS, BUT NOSSIR, NO CIGAR...
     CAUSE THE DAMN CHOPPER FLIES AWAY.

     AND RIGGS DUMPS HIS MAGAZINE, STUFFS IN A NEW ONE ...
     AND JESUS CHRIST HE KEEPS FIRING.

     AS MURTAUGH WALKS UP BESIDE HIM.  STARES DOWN.
     GUN HELD LOOSE AT HIS SIDE.

     RIGGS STILL FIRES, BAM-BAM-BAM
     DOESN'T KNOW IT YET ...
     UNTIL HIS MAGAZINE CLICKS EMPTY.

     HE LIES FLAT.
     STARES.
     PEOPLE SCREAMING, RUNNING AWAY.
     MURTAUGH STANDING OVER HIM, STARING DOWN AT THIS ANIMAL
     WITH A GUN, WHO EVEN NOW REFUSES TO  LOOK  AWAY  FROM  THE
     RETREATING CHOPPER, WHOSE GUN EVEN NOW CONTINUES TO
     FOLLOW ITS COURSE OUT OVER THE SEA.

     HANDS, CLUTCHING TLIE BARREL.
     FINALLY, THEY RELAX.
     RIGGS SHUTS HIS EYES.
     MURTAUGH STARES.

               YOU THROUGH?

     RIGGS LOOKS UP AT HIM.  HIS EYES LOOK LIKE A DEMON'S.

                        RIGGS
               I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.

                                            CUT TO:

91   INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME                                91

     JOSHUA AND HIS PILOT ARE CRUISING OVER THE SURF AT BREAK-
     NECK SPEED, THE ROTOR STIRRING TINY GEYSERS OF WATER.
     JOSHUA SPEAKS INTO A RADIO MICROPHONE.

                         JOSHUA
               YES, SIR ... YES, SIR, MR. LLOYD
               IS DEAD.  I'M AFRAID, HOWEVER,
               THAT ANOTHER PROBLEM EXISTS.

92   INTERCUT - THE GENERAL                                     92

     IN HIS VAN, SPEAKING ON MOBILE PHONE.

                         JOSHUA

                         GENERAL
               ARE THE COPS DEAD?

                         JOSHUA
               NO, SIR.  I MISSED.

     THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PAUSE.  JOSHUA LICKS HIS LIPS.
     THEN:

                         GENERAL
               THAT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING.  THE
               POLICE MAY KNOW EVERYTHING.  THE
               WHOLE OPERATION,  YES?

                         JOSHUA
               YES.  AWAITING ORDERS, SIR.

                         GENERAL
               JOSHUA, I THINK IT'S TIME TO TURN

93   EXT. VIEWSITE - NIGHT                                            93

     A BLACK CAMARO IS PARKED AT THE  SIDE  OF  THE  ROAD.  THE
     CITY TWINKLES BEYOND.

94   INT. CAR - SAME                                                  94

     TWO TEENAGERS, ENGAGED IN A FIRST-RATE MAKEOUT SESSION.
     ONE OF THEM IS ROGER MURTAUGH'S DAUGHTER RIANNE.  THE
     OTHER IS MARK, HE OF THE HILARIOUS DIMPLES.  THEY ARE
     KISSING WHEN RIANNE SUDDENLY PULLS AWAY:

                         RIANNE
               MARK, I GOTTA GET HOME.

                         MARK
               WOULD YOU QUIT WORRYING?  YOUR
               MOM THINKS YOU'RE ASLEEP AND
               YOUR DAD'S BUSY SHOOTING CROOKS.

                         RIANNE
               HE SAID HE'LL SHOOT YOU IF WE
               HAVE SEX.

                         MARK
               SOME THINGS ARE WORTH DYING FOR.

     HE LEANS IN AND KISSES HER.  PASSION, HORNINESS.  SOME-
     THING.  HE RUNS A HAND  INSIDE  HER  SWEATER.  SHE  STARTS  TO
     RESIST.  GIVES IN.

                         RIANNE
               WAIT.

     SHE TAKES OUT HER GUM AND STICKS IT TO THE STEERING WHEEL.      *
     LEANS OVER TO KISS  HIM  AGAIN                                  *

94A  FACE                                                        94A *

95   EXT. THIRD STREET - NIGHT                                       95

     MARTIN RIGGS WALKS SLOWLY DOWN THE BOULEVARD.  IN ONE
     HAND HE CARRIES A SNAPSHOT OF AMANDA LLOYD.  MALE PROS-
     TITUTES TAKE ONE LOOK AT HIM AND FLEE.

     HE STOPS TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE.  AS HE DOES -- HE NOTICES
     A REFLECTION IN THE SILVER LIGHTER.

     TWO PINPOINTS OF LIGHT.  MOVING.  HE THROWS AWAY THE CIG-
     ARETTE. SPINS, DRAWING HIS  GUN.  HEADLIGHTS,  AS  A  CAR
     COMES BARRELING OUT OF THE DARKNESS.  BEARING DOWN ON
     RIGGS AT FIFTY MILES AN  HOUR.  RIGGS  FIRES.  THE  WIND-
     SHIELD SPLINTERS.  NO DICE.  THE CAR KEEPS COMING.  RIGGS
     FIRES AGAIN, SPRINTS FOR COVER -- AS  A  MERCENARY  LEANS
     OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW WITH A PUMP SHOTGUN.  TRIGGERS
     THREE BLASTS AT RIGGS. THE FIRST TWO  BLOW  OUT  CHUNKS  OF
     SCENERY. THE THIRD TAKES RIGGS  IN  THE  CHEST.  BLOWS  HIM
     BACKWARD THROUGH A STORE WINDOW.  GLASS SHATTERS.  HE HITS
     THE GROUND IN A HEAP.  THE CAR SHRIEKS OFF INTO THE NIGHT,
     LAYING RUBBER.  THE ECHO OF GUNFIRE SLOWLY FADES ON THE
     WIND...

96   INSIDE DARKENED STORE                                        96

     RIGGS LIES CRUMPLED IN A POOL  OF  BROKEN  GLASS.  MURTAUGH
     CHARGES FROM ACROSS THE STREET.  HE THROWS HIMSELF DOWN
     BESIDE THE DEAD RIGGS.  RIPS OPEN RIGGS' SHIRT REVEALING --
     A BULLETPROOF VEST.  RIGGS OPENS HIS EYES.

                         RIGGS
               I'M PISSED, ROGER.  NOW I'M PISSED.

96A  EXT.  STORE                                           96A

     THE COPS EXIT AND CROSS THE STREET TOWARD THEIR CAR.

                         RIGGS
               ROGER.  QUIT LOOKING SO DAMN
               WORRIED.  I'M   FINE.

                         MURTAUGH
               TWO INCHES HIGHER, THEY WOULD'VE
               GOT YOUR HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               FUCK THAT.  TWO INCHES TO THE LEFT,
               THEY WOULD'VE GOT MY SMOKES.

     HE TAKES OUT A PACK, LIGHTS ONE UP.

                         RIGGS
               OH, BY THE WAY:  GUY WHO SHOT ME?

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.

                         RIGGS

97   EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT

     MURTAUGH'S CAR SCREECHES TO THE CURB.  HOPS THE SIDEWALK,
     JOLTS TO A STOP.  THE TWO COPS ARE OUT AND RUNNING IN A
     DEAD HEAT TOWARD THE FRONT DOOR. MURTAUGH FLINGS OPEN
     THE DOOR. STOPS. ON THE CARPET BENEATH THE MAIL  SLOT
     IS A TINY ENVELOPE WITH SEASONS GREETINGS EMBLAZONED
     ACROSS THE FRONT.  A NOTE IS ATTACHED WITH A PAPER CLIP.
     ONE SIDE READS DETECTIVE ROGER MURTAUGH. ON THE OTHER
     SIDE IS A MESSAGE IN BLOCK CAPITALS.

               YOUR DAUGHTER LOOKS REALLY PRETTY NAKED

     MURTAUGH TEARS OPEN THE ENVELOPE, AFRAID TO BREATHE.
     INSIDE IS A POLAROID SNAPSHOT. THE AUDIENCE MAY GET A
     GLIMPSE OF IT, OR THEY MAY NOT.  EITHER WAY, THE EFFECT
     IT HAS ON MURTAUGH IS DEVASTATING.  HE DROPS THE SNAPSHOT
     LIKE A LIVE SNAKE.  BACKS AWAY, STUMBLES INTO THE WALL.
     SHAKES HIS HEAD.

                         MURTAUGH
               BASTARDS ... BASTARDS ...

     RIGGS LOOKS ON, STUNNED.  THE TELEPHONE RINGS.  RINGS
     AGAIN.

                         RIGGS
               ROGER.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS UP. SNAPS OUT  OF   IT.  DOWN  THE  HALL,  HIS
     WIFE TRISH MOVES TO ANSWER THE    PHONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T ANSWER THAT!!

     HE RUSHES DOWN THE HALL, SCOOPS UP THE RECEIVER:

                         MURTAUGH
               MURTAUGH.

     HE LISTENS INTENTLY, A LOOK OF PURE DREAD ON HIS FACE.
     HANGS UP SLOWLY, STARES STRAIGHT  AHEAD.  ON  THE  TABLE,  A
     STUFFED BEAR STARES BACK IMPASSIVELY.  TRISH MURTAUGH
     LOOKS ON, TERRIFIED.

                         MURTAUGH
               THEY TOOK MY KID... BASTARDS TOOK
               MY KID ...

     BESIDE HIM, RIGGS' FACE CONTORTS INTO A LOOK OF SHEER,
     BRUTAL HATRED ... GET READY FOR WORLD WAR THREE.

     MCCASKEY IS SEATED NEXT TO A  BANK  OF  TELEPHONES,  SMOKING
     AND READING A COMIC BOOK. BEHIND HIM  THE  FAT  COP  WE  SAW
     EARLIER IS CONDUCTING HIS CHOIR IN A THOROUGHLY HIDEOUS
     VERSION OF "DECK THE HALLS."  THE PHONE RINGS.

                         SINGING COPS
               'DON WE NOW OUR GAY APPAREL...'

     JOSHUA IS ON THE OTHER END.  BESIDE HIM THE GENERAL
     LOOKS ON INTENTLY.

                         JOSHUA
               HELLO, I'M CALLING FROM THE

                    (INTERRUPTING)
               YES, SERGEANT RIGGS HAS BEEN
               KILLED.  SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST
               BY UNKNOWN ASSAILANTS.

                         JOSHUA
               MY GOD.  I'M SORRY.

                         MCCASKEY
               IT'S A BAD DAY FOR ALL OF US.  AND
               WHAT IS YOUR NAME, SIR?

                         JOSHUA
               GOODBYE.

     HE HANGS UP.  TURNS TO THE GENERAL.

                         JOSHUA
               BINGO.  RIGGS IS OUT OF THE
               PICTURE.

                    (NODS)
               I WANT MURTAUGH TAKEN ALIVE.

                         JOSHUA
               HE MAY NOT TALK.

                         GENERAL
               WE HAVE HIS LITTLE GIRL.  HE'LL
               TALK.

101  INT. RIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                               101  *

     TRISH MURTAUGH LOOKS LIKE SHE COULD COME APART AT ANY       *
     MOMENT.
     SHE WALKS AROUND THE BEDROOM, SLOWLY.
     TOUCHING THINGS.
     TOUCHING HER DAUGHTER'S POSSESSIONS.

     MURTAUGH ENTERS.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER.
     HE HANDS HER THE .22.

                         MURTAUGH
               TAKE THIS.  UNTIL IT'S OVER, I
               DON'T WANT YOU TO LET IT OUT OF
               YOUR SIGHT.
     HIS WIFE NODS.  RUNS A HAND THROUGH HER HAIR.  SHIFTS
     FROM ONE FOOT TO THE OTHER.

                         MURTAUGH
               THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HURT HER.
               IF I DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY...
               THEY'LL LET HER GO.
                    (BEAT)
               SHE'S COMING HOME.

     A MOMENT.  THEN:

                         TRISH
               WHAT ABOUT YOU  ...  ?

     MURTAUGH SAYS NOTHING.

102  INT.  LIVING  ROOM  -  SAME  TIME                        102

     RIGGS HAS HIS SHIRT OFF, AND IS CAREFULLY REMOVING
     SLIVERS OF GLASS FROM HIS SHOULDER.  CIGARETTE DANGLING
     FROM HIS LIPS.

     HE HEARS A NOISE
     AND SPINS, STARTLED.

103  RIGGS' POV - SIX-YEAR-OLD CARRIE MURTAUGH             103

     ADORABLE IN A BLUE NIGHTGOWN, RICKLES THE CAT CRADLED
     LOVINGLY IN HER ARMS.

     RIGGS RELAXES.
     SMILES.
     CARRIE WALKS  OVER  TO  HIM.

                         RIGGS
               HEY, MISSY.

                         CARRIE
               I  CAN'T   SLEEP.

                         RIGGS
               UH-OH.  NOT GOOD.

     HE SCOOPS HER UP.

                         RIGGS
               WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

                         CARRIE
               RICKLES THE CAT.

                         RIGGS
               HUH.  HE IS  A  CUTIE.

     CARRIE LOOKS  AT  HIM  THEN.
     AND SHE DOES A PECULIAR THING.
     SLOWLY, SHE REACHES OUT ...
     RIGGS LOOKING ON...
     AND TOUCHES HIS BACK.  RUNS HER TINY HAND OVER THE KNIFE
     SCAR BENEATH HIS SHOULDER.
     FASCINATED BY IT.

                         CARRIE
               OUCH.

     RIGGS LOOKS AT HER.  SMILES, AND WHISPERS SOFTLY:

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.
                    (BEAT)
               OUCH...

     AND HE SUDDENLY HUGS THE LITTLE GIRL FOR ALL HE'S  WORTH.
     CLOSES HIS EYES TIGHT.

     IN THAT MOMENT, EVERY SINGLE YEAR CATCHES UP TO RIGGS,
     AND HE LOOKS, FOR A MOMENT, INCREDIBLY OLD, AND SO VERY,
     VERY TIRED ...

104  INT. LIVING ROOM  -  LATER                             104

     CARRIE IS ASLEEP ON THE COUCH, SNUGGLED BENEATH A KNITTED
     AFGHAN.  RIGGS AND MURTAUGH STAND ACROSS THE ROOM, CON-
     FERRING IN HUSHED TONES.

                         RIGGS
               YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO KILL
               HER.

                         MURTAUGH
               YES.

                         RIGGS
               YOU WANT HER BACK, YOU'VE GOT TO
               TAKE HER  AWAY  FROM  THEM.

                         MURTAUGH
               I KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               GOOD.  WE DO THIS MY WAY.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU SHOOT, YOU SHOOT TO KILL.  GET
               AS MANY AS YOU CAN.  DON'T MISS.

                         MURTAUGH
               I WON'T MISS.

     A PAUSE.  RIGGS STUDIES MURTAUGH.  THEN:

                         RIGGS
               WE'RE GONNA GET BLOODY ON THIS ONE.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST ME.

     MURTAUGH STARES AT HIM FOR A MOMENT.  THEN, HE FINALLY
     SPEAKS ...

                         MURTAUGH
               ... HOW... GOOD ARE YOU... ?

                         RIGGS
               WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               ARE YOU... ONLY CRAZY ... OR ARE
               YOU... AS GOOD AS YOU SAY YOU
               ARE... ?

     THERE  IS  A  PAUSE.   THEN:

                         RIGGS
               NO ONE CAN TOUCH ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               GOOD.  KILL EVERY FUCKING ONE OF
               THEM.  OKAY ... ?

     AT WHICH POINT, MY FRIENDS, A LIGHT FLICKERS ON BEHIND
     RIGGS' EYES.

     WE SEE  GRIM  DETERMINATION,  SURE  ...
     BUT WE ALSO SENSE SOMETHING ELSE, ODDLY ENOUGH:
     ANTICIPATION.
     RIGGS IS A MACHINE ... AND THE MACHINE IS, WELL ...
     REVVING  UP.  HE  LOOKS  AT   MURTAUGH:

                         RIGGS
               GET HALF.  I'LL KILL THE OTHER
               HALF.

     A MOMENT PASSES BETWEEN THEM. THIS  WILL  BE  THE  MOST
     DEVASTATING NIGHT OF THEIR LIVES.  THEY WILL PROBABLY
     DIE.

     A RINGING PHONE SHATTERS THE STILLNESS.

                         RIGGS
               HERE WE GO.

105  OMITTED                                                       105

106  INT. MARTIN RIGGS' TRAILER - DAY                              106

     THE APARTMENT IS DARK, ILLUMINATED ONLY  BY  A  TINY  LAMP.
     RIGGS CROSSES TO THE WINDOW, PEERS OUT THROUGH SLATTED
     BLINDS.  ON TELEVISION A GROUP OF CAROLERS SINGS "TIDINGS
     OF COMFORT AND JOY." RIGGS  LOOKS  AT  THE  WALL  CALENDAR:
     DECEMBER 22.  THE CLOCK TICKS.  THE REFRIGERATOR HUMS.

     HE GOES TO THE CLOSET.  OPENS IT.  A CLOUD OF DUST
     BILLOWS OUT. REACHES  IN,  REMOVES  A  WEATHERED  CARDBOARD
     BOX.  SITS IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM, TAKES A SHOT OF
     BOURBON.

     OPENS THE BOX. INSIDE IS  A  SET  OF  DESERT  FATIGUES.  HE
     TAKES THEM OUT.  UNDERNEATH  A  WICKED-LOOKING  HUNTING
     KNIFE. HE TAKES THAT, TOO.  HOLDS  IT  UP  NEAR  HIS  FACE,
     AND IT POSITIVELY SPARKLES IN THE DIM LIGHT ...

                                                 TIME  CUT:

107  ANOTHER ANGLE                                          107

     RIGGS STANDS, FULLY DRESSED.  COLT .22 IN AN ANKLE
     HOLSTER.  COMBAT WEBBING.  DESERT BOOTS.

     BERETTA .9 MILLIMETER, RIDING THE RIGHT-HAND THIGH.
     SCANS HIS APPEARANCE IN THE MIRROR.
     BREATHES:  IN, OUT ... IN, OUT...

     GLANCES AT THE PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS WIFE ON THE WALL.
     WEDDING GOWN.  WHITE LACE-AND-SATIN RUFFLES.  BEAUTIFUL.

     HIS FACE IS  CRAGGY.  WEATHERED.  COVERED  WITH  DESERT
     PAINT.  SURELY HE WAS NEVER MARRIED ... NOT THIS DEMON...

                         RIGGS
               FORGIVE ME.

     THERE IS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  RIGGS SPINS.  LIGHTNING
     QUICK.  GUN IN HAND.

                         RIGGS
               COME IN SLOW.

     THE DOOR OPENS  AND ROGER MURTAUGH ENTERS, CARRYING A
     BRIEFCASE.  HE  LOOKS BRIEFLY AT RIGGS' COMBAT GET-UP.
     SHRUGS.  SETS THE BRIEFCASE ON THE BED, OPENS IT.  IT
     IS FILLED WITH ROUND UPON ROUND OF AMMUNITION.

                         MURTAUGH
               HOLLOW POINTS.  ARMOR PIERCING.

     MURTAUGH  WAITS.  SWEATING.   HANDS   IN   POCKETS.   AND   OUT
     COMES RIANNE, FOLLOWED BY THE VICIOUS MERC.  HE HOLDS A
     KNIFE SQUARELY AT HER THROAT.  MURTAUGH'S EYES FILL WITH
     TEARS.  RELIEF THAT SHE'S ALIVE..

               SIMPLE EXCHANGE.  YOU COME WITH
               US, THE GIRL TAKES A WALK.

     CLUTCHES  A  SHINY  METAL   SPHERE.   A   GRENADE.   MURTAUGH'S
     GRIP IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING IT DEAD.  THE MERC SWEARS
     VIOLENTLY.

                         MURTAUGH
               THIS FUCKER'S ALIVE.
                    (BEAT)
               LET HER GO OR WE ALL DIE.

     AND THAT'S WHEN MR. JOSHUA STEPS OUT OF THE CAR.  DEADLY
     CALM.  ALL HEADS TURN.  CREWCUT-  MIRRORED SUNGLASSES.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               TAKE HIM.

                         MERC #1
               BUT SIR ...

                         MR. JOSHUA
               HE'S BLUFFING, IT'S A DUD.  HE
               WOULDN'T RISK KILLING HIS
               DAUGHTER.

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T PUSH  ME.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               TAKE HIM.

116  EXT. HILLTOP  - MEANWHILE                                  116

     FAR AWAY.  THE CAR AND THE SURROUNDING FIGURES ARE TINY.
     A LONE SOLDIER CROUCHES.  RIGGS.  THE RIFLE IS ON HIS
     SHOULDER.  HIS EYE IS GLUED TO THE SCOPE.

117  INFRA-RED IMAGE SHOWS RIANNE AND HER CAPTOR                117

     RIGGS' CONCENTRATION IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.  LIKE A
     STATUE.  HE LICKS A FINGER.  RAISES IT, TESTING THE WIND.

                         RIGGS
               COME ON... COME ON...

118  BACK WITH MURTAUGH                                         118

     AS HE AND JOSHUA STARE EACH OTHER DOWN.  TENSE.  TENSE.
     HIS HAND CLUTCHES THE GRENADE.  MERC #1 PUSHES THE KNIFE
     INTO RIANNE'S THROAT.

                         MERC #1
               PUT THE PIN BACK IN.  DO IT.

     MURTAUGH SWEATS.  MR. JOSHUA BEGINS TO WALK FORWARD,
     GUN EXTENDED.  COOL AS ICE.  ANOTHER STEP.  SMILING ...

119  ON  HILLTOP                                                119

     RIGGS SITS DEAD STILL, FOCUSING THROUGH THE SNIPER
     SCOPE.

                         RIGGS
               COME ON... MOVE AWAY FROM THE GIRL ...

120  MURTAUGH                                            120

     JOSHUA STOPS IN FRONT OF MURTAUGH.  COCKS THE GUN.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               DROP THE FUCKING GRENADE.

                         MURTAUGH
               I DO AND WE DIE.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               NO.  I DON'T THINK SO.

     HE SIGHTS DOWN THE GUN AND PULLS THE TRIGGER:  ALL HELL
     BREAKS LOOSE. HERE'S  WHAT  HAPPENS:  BAM  --  !  THE  BULLET
     CATCHES MURTAUGH IN THE SHOULDER.  HE DROPS THE GRENADE.
     IT ROLLS, AND MERCS DIVE FOR COVER.  THE MERC HOLDING
     RIANNE TAKES A STEP BACK.  BINGO.

121  ON HILL                                                        121

     RIGGS GRUNTS.  FIRES.

122  BELOW                                                          122

     THE MERC DROPS.  JOSHUA'S HEAD SNAPS AROUND.  HE STARES
     OFF AT THE DISTANCE AND HISSES:

                         JOSHUA
               RIGGS ... !

     MEANWHILE, MURTAUGH ROLLS, COMES  UP,  GUN  IN  HAND.  FIRES,
     BAM

                         MURTAUGH
               RIANNE, THE CAR!

     RIANNE BOLTS.  MEANWHILE --

123  ON  HILLTOP                                                    123

     RIGGS SWIVELS THE BARREL, HALF AN INCH.  GRUNTS.  FIRES.

124  DOWN  BELOW                                                    124

     THE BLACK SEDAN'S WINDSHIELD SPLINTERS.  THE CAR ROCKS
     WITH THE IMPACT AS THE DRIVER IS KILLED INSTANTLY.

125  GRENADE                                                        125

     CHOOSES THAT MOMENT TO EXPLODE, POOF ... INTO A CLOUD OF
     ORANGE SMOKE.  A SHOWER OF CONFETTI.

                         JOSHUA
               DUD!  IT'S A DUD!

126  RIANNE                                                         126

     IS RUNNING FOR THE CAR AS JOSHUA SWIVELS  IN  HER  DIRECTION,
     LINING UP THE UZI, FIRING A BURST --  UNTIL  A  BULLET  FROM
     RIGGS PARTS HIS HAIR, SENDS HIM DIVING TO  THE  SAND,  THE
     UZI SPROUTING FLAME -- AS RIANNE FLINGS OPEN  THE  CAR  DOOR,
     SCREAMS -- AT THE BLOOD-SPATTERED  CORPSE  WHICH  ROLLS  OFF
     THE STEERING WHEEL. BULLETS  BLAST  THE  CAR.  METAL  POPS
     AND BURSTS.  SHE JUMPS IN.

127  MURTAUGH                                                       127

     IS FLAT ON THE SAND, FIRING LIKE CRAZY, SHOT  AFTER  SHOT  --
     AS RIANNE FLOORS THE GAS, THE CAR PEELING OUT  IN  A'  STORM
     OF FLYING SAND AND DIRT.  DOOR OPEN.  ONE LEG HANGING
     OUT.  PLOWS INTO AN ATMED MERC.  HE FLIES UP ONTO THE
     HOOD, SPINS, STILL CONSCIOUS, AND TAKES  AIM  THROUGH  THE
     WINDSHIELD, RIGHT AT HER ...

128  ON HILL                                                        128

     RIGGS SWIVELS, LIGHTNING QUICK.

                         RIGGS
               NO.

     GRUNTS.  FIRES.

129  MERC ON HOOD                                                   129

     IS BLOWN OFF THE CAR.

130  RIANNE                                                         130

     SCREAMS, THE DEAD DRIVER SPRAWLED  AGAINST  ONE  SHOULDER,
     HER FOOT NAILED TO THE GAS PEDAL ... AS THE CAR LEAPS
     LIKE A KICKED DOG AND CAREENS OFF INTO THE DESERT.

131  ON  HILLTOP                                                    131

     RIGGS LINES UP FOR ANOTHER SHOT -- AND THERE IS A SOFT
     CLICK -- !  HE  WHIRLS.  THE  GENERAL  HAS  ARRIVED.  STAND-
     ING AT THE TOP OF THE HILL.  HIS M-16 IS COCKED AND
     LOCKED.

                         GENERAL
               YOU'RE NOT THAT FAST, SON.
                    (BEAT)
               DROP THE RIFLE.

     HE SPEAKS INTO A WALKIE-TALKIE.

                         GENERAL
               I GOT RIGGS.

132  ON DESERT FLOOR                                           132

     MURTAUGH MAKES A BREAK FOR IT, FIRING BLIND -- UNTIL THE
     GROUND BEFORE HIM LITERALLY EXPLODES WITH GUNFIRE.  THE
     EARTH IS CHOPPED TO TATTERS.  DIRT FLIES.  HE STOPS.
     PUFFING FOR BREATH.  RAISES HIS HANDS.  AS THE SMOKE
     CLEARS, MR. JOSHUA APPROACHES LIKE A DEINON THROUGH FOG.
     HE IS FLANKED BY TWO MERCS WITH UZIS-

                         JOSHUA
               A VERY NICE TRY.
                    (SPEAKS INTO
                     WALKIE-TALKIE)
               KENDO.  GET THE GIRL.

133  ON  HILLTOP                                               133

     RIGGS STANDS, HANDS OVER HEAD.  THE GENERAL STUDIES HIM
     THOUGHTFULLY.

                         GENERAL
               MARTIN RIGGS.  YOUR COMBAT RECORD
               IS THE STUFF OF LEGEND.

                         RIGGS
               SO IS YOURS.  GENERAL PETER
               MCALLISTER, COMMANDER OF SHADOW
               COMPANY.

                         GENERAL
               I SEE WE'VE HEARD OF EACH OTHER.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.  IT'LL ALMOST BE A SHAME
               WHEN I KILL YOU.

                         GENERAL
                    (LAUGHS)
               I DON'T THINK SO, SON.

134  DESERT FLOOR                                              134

     MR. JOSHUA SAYS TO MURTAUGH:

                         MR. JOSHUA
               YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN EVENING.

                         MURTAUGH
               GO SPIT.

     JOSHUA SLAMS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH A KARATE BLOW.  HE
     FALLS.

135  EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY                                      135

     RIANNE IS DRIVING TO SAVE  HER  LIFE.  SCREAMING  AT  THE
     TOP OF HER LUNGS, THE NEEDLE TOUCHING  90  AS  SHE  STRUG-
     GLES TO SHOVE THE MERC'S DEAD BODY INTO THE CORNER.
     SWERVING.  SCREAMING.  AT WHICH POINT

     THE SAND EXPLODES IN FRONT OF HER.

     SHE SHRIEKS. A HOWL OF  NOISE,  A  VERITABLE  ERUPTION  OF
     SAND AND DIRT, AND IT'S ONE OF  TWO  THINGS,  IT'S  EITHER
     ALIENS FROM SPACE, DESCENDING -- OR  IT'S  A  BELL  COBRA
     HELICOPTER.

     RIANNE SWERVES TO A HALT TO  AVOID  THE  DRONING  CHOPPER,
     WHICH HOVERS LIKE A BEHEMOTH, ROTORS THROBBING, AS
     RIANNE STUMBLES FROM THE CAR AND COLLAPSES IN A HEAP
     ON THE SAND.

     LOST, ALONE, HER TEARS INAUDIBLE  OVER  THE  HIGH,  CHURN-
     ING WHINE AS WE

                                           FADE OUT.

                                          FADE IN:

136  INT. BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT                                  136

     RIGGS IS NAKED.  HE IS MANACLED HAND AND FOOT.  CHAINED
     IN A BATHTUB FULL OF WATER.  AROUND HIM IS A DINGY CON-
     CRETE BASEMENT.  JOSHUA  STEPS  FORWARD.  BEHIND  HIM  IS
     KENDO, AN ORIENTAL MERCENARY.  HE IS WORKING ON A MECHAN-
     ICAL DEVICE OF SOME KIND.  CONNECTING WIRES.  RIGGS
     GRUNTS.

                         JOSHUA
               WELL, WELL.  LOOK WHO'S BACK FROM
               THE DEAD.

     RIGGS STRUGGLES AGAINST  THE  MANACLES,  SLOPPING  WATER.

                         JOSHUA
               PLEASE SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.  I
               BELIEVE YOU'LL NEED IT.

     RIGGS STOPS MOVING.  SCOWLS AT JOSHUA AND SAYS NOTHING.
     JOSHUA SMILES.

                         JOSHUA
               YOU'RE JUST IN TIME FOR A LOT OF
               PAIN.

                         RIGGS
               I'M THRILLED.

                         JOSHUA
               OH, YOU WILL BE.  I DARESAY
               YOU'LL BE ... SHOCKED.

     KENDO SNICKERS IN THE CORNER.

                         RIGGS
               WHO'S THE CHIN?

                         JOSHUA
               SHHH.  DON'T MAKE HIM MAD.

                         RIGGS
               MY MISTAKE. WHO'S  THE  PLEASANT
               ORIENTAL PSYCHOPATH?

                         JOSHUA
               HIS NAME IS KENDO, AND HE HAS
               FORGOTTEN MORE ABOUT  DISPENSING
               PAIN THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               TERRIFIC. LISTEN, GUYS,  CAN  WE
               GET SOME MISTER BUBBLE IN HERE ...

                        JOSHUA
               PLEASE SHUT UP.
                    (STUDIES RIGGS)
               MY, MY, LOOK AT ALL THOSE SCARS.
                    (BEAT)
               SEE, MARTIN, WE HAVE A  PROBLEM.
               SINCE WE HAVE MURTAUGH, WE REALLY
               DON'T EVEN NEED YOU.  BUT I
               BELIEVE IN BEING THOROUGH.

     ACROSS THE ROOM, KENDO THROWS A SWITCH.  A MECHANICAL
     HUMMING FILLS THE ROOM.

                         JOSHUA
               OUR PROBLEM -- AND YOURS, TOO
               IS THAT WE HAVE SOME
               MERCHANDISE TO DELIVER.  A RATHER
               LARGE SHIPMENT, WE'RE ALL VERY
               EXCITED.  IT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE,
               HOWEVER, IF WE SHOWED UP WITH THE
               GOODS AND FOUND OURSELVES
               SURROUNDED BY FIFTY COPS.

                         RIGGS
               THAT WOULD BE A SHAME.

                         JOSHUA
               INDEED.  SO YOU SEE, MARTIN, IT
               IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE FIND OUT
               HOW MUCH THE POLICE KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               WE DON'T KNOW SHIT.  YOU KILLED
               LLOYD BEFORE HE COULD TALK.

                         JOSHUA
               I WISH I COULD BELIEVE YOU.
               UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T.  SO, IF
               YOU'LL BE KIND ENOUGH TO TELL
               US ALL YOU KNOW, I WILL  KILL
               YOU QUICKLY.

                         RIGGS
               SUCH A DEAL, I SHOULD  WORRY.

                         JOSHUA
               OH, INDEED YOU  SHOULD.  SEE,
               MARTIN, YOU ------- TALK TO US ...

     HE GESTURES TO KENDO, WHO APPROACHES.  HE IS CARRYING A
     VERY OMINOUS DEVICE:  A SPONGE, ATTACHED TO A PORTABLE
     DRY-CELL BATTERY CASING ... JOSHUA FROWNS AT RIGGS.

                         JOSHUA
               DO YOU VOMIT?

                         RIGGS
               SOMETIMES.

     JOSHUA NODS.  SIGHS.

                         JOSHUA
               BACK BEFORE PRISON REFORM, THE
               STAFF AT SING SING INVENTED A
               RATHER UNUSUAL FORM OF PUNISHMENT.
               IT'S KNOW AS THE  HUMMINGBIRD
               TREATMENT.  ARE YOU FAMILIAR?

                         RIGGS
               PLEASE, NO TICKLING.  I  HATE
               TICKLING.

                         JOSHUA
               THE 'PATIENT' IS CHAINED NAKED
               IN A BATHTUB FULL OF WATER.  A
               BATH IS THEN ADMINISTERED USING
               A BATTERY POWERED SPONGE.  THE
               PAIN IS SAID TO BE SO EXCRUCIATING
               THAT AFTER TWENTY MINUTES MOST
               MEN ARE EITHER INSANE OR DEAD.

     RIGGS IS SILENT.

                         JOSHUA
               I THOUGHT YOU'D  LIKE IT.  I CAN
               OF COURSE, KILL YOU NOW.  SIMPLY
               TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               GUESS WE'RE IN FOR A LONG NIGHT.
               'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW SCRATCH.

                         JOSHUA
               WE'LL FIND OUT.  KENDO ... ?

     THE ORIENTAL MOVES FORWARD.  HE BRANDISHES THE SPONGE/
     BATTERY HOOKUP.  DIPS IT INTO A BUCKET OF WATER.  RIGGS
     IS SWEATING.

                         JOSHUA
               FEEL FREE TO  SCREAM.

                         RIGGS
               HAVEN'T YOU GUYS...   HEARD OF
               YULETIDE  CHEER... ?

     KENDO HITS RIGGS WITH THE SPONGE.  RIGGS SCREAMS.  A
     HIGH, LUNATIC SCREAM.

     THRASHES IN THE WATER, SPLASHING KENDO, WHIPPING FROM
     SIDE TO SIDE AS THE ROOM SPIRALS BACK AND FORTH OUT OF
     FOCUS.  KIDS, DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.  KENDO REMOVES THE
     DEVICE.  RIGGS FALLS BACKWARD.  THUMPS AGAINST THE TUB.
     SUCKING AIR.  MOANING.

                         JOSHUA
               MY GOODNESS.  NOW THAT WAS FUN,
               WASN'T IT?

     RIGGS LOOKS AT HIM.  DRIPPING HATE.

                         RIGGS
               I'M GOING TO KILL BOTH OF YOU.

                         JOSHUA
                    (LAUGHS)
               THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
                    (BEAT)
               ABOUT THE SHIPMENT ... ?

                         RIGGS
               FUCK  YOURSELF.

     KENDO DUNKS THE BATTERY..  RUN IT DOWN RIGGS' STOMACH.
     HE SCREAMS AGAIN, AS WE MERCIFULLY ...

                                                       CUT TO:

138  INT. DINGY BACK ROOM - SAME                                 138

     NO WINDOWS.  HARDWOOD FLOORS.  A SINGLE CHAIR IN THE
     CENTER OF THE ROOM.  ROGER MURTAUGH IS STRAPPED TIGHTLY
     TO THE CHAIR.  HIS FACE LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING HIS WIFE
     MAKES FOR DINNER.  BLACK EYES.  SWOLLEN JAW.  HIS SHIRT
     IS OFF, EXPOSING THE GUNSHOT WOUND IN HIS ARM.  THE
     GENERAL STANDS FACING HIM, FLANKED BY THREE MERCS.  THEY
     ALL WEAR HOLSTERED SIDEARMS.

                         GENERAL
               THE SHIPMENT, MR. MURTAUGH?

                         MURTAUGH
               GO SPIT.

                         GENERAL
                    (SIGHS)
               I HOPE YOU ENJOY SAYING THAT AS
               MUCH AS MR. LARCH ENJOYS PUNISHING
               YOU FOR IT.

     MR. LARCH, A BIG REDNECK WITH NO DISCERNIBLE COMPASSION,
     STEPS FORWARD.  POURS A BIG HANDFUL OF BAKING SALT FROM A
     CONTAINER.  PACKS IT INTO ROGER MURTAUGH'S GUNSHOT WOUND.
     MURTAUGH GROANS.  SHOUTS.  STRUGGLES.

     THE GENERAL LOOLCS ON WITHOUT BLINKING.

                         MURTAUGH
               THAT'S IT ... IF YOU GUYS THINK
               I'M SENDING YOU A CHRISTMAS CARD
               YOU'RE NUTS.

     LARCH CUFFS HIM, HARD.

                         GENERAL
                    (SHAKES HIS
                     HEAD)
               THIS IS GOING NOWHERE.  MR.
               LARCH ... ?

     LARCH GRINS, LEAVES THE ROOM.  A PAUSE.  MURTAUGH SWEATS,
     GLARING OUT FROM SWOLLEN EYELIDS.  THE GENERAL NODS,
     SMILES.

139  INT. BASEMENT  -  BACK  WITH  RIGGS                             139

     AS  HE  GROANS  AND  COLLAPSE  BACK INTO THE TUB.  SPLASH.
     MOANS  FEEBLY.  BLOOD  DRIPS   FROM HIS NOSE.  SALIVA DROOLS
     FROM HIS LIMP MOUTH.  HE LOOKS HALF-DEAD, PROBABLY BE-
     CAUSE HE IS JUST THAT.  KENDO PULLS AWAY THE BATTERY
     SPONGE,  SAYS  TO  JOSHUA:

                         KENDO
               HE KNOWS SHIT.  WE'RE SAFE.

                         JOSHUA
               YOU'RE SURE?

                         KENDO
               BELIEVE ME, HE'D HAVE TOLD US.

                         JOSHUA
               FINE.
                    (CLUCKS IN
                     DISGUST)
               BIG, BAD SOLDIER ... MY ASS.
                    (BEAT)
               I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.  DEAL WITH
               HIM.

                         KENDO
               DEAL  WITH   HIM?

                         JOSHUA
               YEAH.
                    (STOPS AT
                     THE DOOR)
               FRY  HIS  NUTS.

     HE EXITS.

                                            CUT TO:

140  INT. DINGY BACK ROOM - SAME TIME                            140

     THE GENERAL LEANS OVER MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH SWEATS.

                         GENERAL
               ANYTIME, ROGER.  ANYTIME.
                    (BEAT)
               SEE, THE THING OF IT IS ... WE KNOW
               WHERE YOU LIVE.
                    (FROWNS)
               IN FACT, MR. JOSHUA HAS BEEN KNOWN
               TO EXTERMINATE ENTIRE FAMILIES,
               WHEN HE GETS IN... ONE OF HIS
               MOODS.  OH, SPEAKING OF THAT --

     LARCH RE-ENTERS THE DINGY BACK ROOM.  THIS TIME HE'S  GOT
     MURTAUGH'S DAUGHTER RIANNE.  SHE IS CLAD ONLY IN A
     T-SHIRT AND BIKINI BRIEFS.

                         RIANNE
               DADDY ... PLEASE DON'T LET THEM
               HURT ME ... !

     MURTAUGH GOES NUTS.  STRUGGLES, WRENCHES, BANGS THE CHAIR UP
     AND DOWN AGAINST THE FLOOR.  NO USE.  HE IS COMPLETELY HELP-
     LESS.  SNARLS WITH RAGE:

                         MURTAUGH
               BASTARDS ... UNTIE ME AND I'LL
               KILL EVERY ONE OF YOU.

                         GENERAL
               PRECISELY WHY WE WOULD NEVER
               THINK OF UNTYING YOU.

     LARCH SHOVES RIANNE INTO THE CORNER.  SHE LANDS IN A HEAP.
     MURTAUGH IS SWEATING BUCKETS.  EYES DESPERATE.  THE
     GENERAL LEANS IN CLOSE:

                         GENEPAL
               IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING, SON, YOU
               BETTER PLAY BALL, 'CAUSE THE STAKES
               JUST WENT UP ...

141  INT. BASEMENT - SAME TIME                              141

     KENDO SWITCHES ON THE BATTERY AGAIN.  IN THE TUB, RIGGS'
     HEAD LOLLS BACK AND FORTH.  LISTLESS.  DEAD.  HIS EYES
     REFUSE TO FOCUS.  KENDO SHOWS HIM THE SPONGE.

                         RIGGS
                    (SLURRED)
               NO ... PLEASE ...

                         KENDO
               YOU DIE NOW, SERGEANT RIGGS.
               VERY SLOW.

     RIGGS  DOES  NOT  RESPOND.  STARES  INTO  SPACE.    KENDO   LEANS
     OVER THE TUB,  REACHES  IN  --  AND  THAT'S  WHEN  WE FIND OUT
     RIGGS  HAS  BEEN  FAKING.  HIS  EYES  FOCUS.   NO  LONGER HAZED.
     HE SNAPS HIS HAND  FORWARD  TO  THE  END  OF  THE  CHAIN.  GRABS
     KENDO BY THE  HAIR.  IN  THE  BLINK  OF  AN  EYE,  HE  SLAMS  THE
     MAN'S HEAD DOWN AGAINST THE PORCELAIN TUB.  KENDO'S   NOSE
     SHATTERS.  THE ORIENTAL TOPPLES OVER INTO THE TUB.  THE
     BATTERY DROPS  TO  THE  FLOOR.  RIGGS  IS  A  FUCKING  MACHINE:
     HE FLIPS THE CHAIN AROUND KENDO'S NECK AND WRENCHES.
     HARD.  HE GOES LIMP.  RIGGS IS NOT THROUGH YET.  HE
     BEGINS TO  HEAVE  AND  THRASH,  THRUSTING  AGAINST  THE  CHAINS
     -- MANEUVERING THE CORPSE ON TOP OF HIM.  SHIFTING IT.
     MOVING KENDO'S PANTS POCKET WITHIN REACH.  HE REACHES IN.
     SLOWLY, CAREFULLY, BRINGS OUT A SHINY SILVER KEY ...

142  INT. DINGY BACK ROOM --  SAME TIME                    142

     A LENGTH OF ROPE IS PULLED TAUT.  RIANNE'S BOUND HANDS
     ARE STRETCHED OVER HER HEAD.  LARCH HOOKS THE ROPE AROUND
     A PEG SET INTO THE WALL.  SHE IS HELPLESS.  MURTAUGH IS
     OUT  OF  HIS  MIND.  STRUGGLING  TO  BREAK  FREE.

                         GENERAL
               GOOD LORD.  VERY WHOLESOME-
               LOOKING GIRL.  YESSIRREEE.

                         MURTAUGH
               GODDAMMIT, I'VE TOLD YOU
               EVERYTHING!!!!

                         GENERAL
               WE'LL SOON KNOW, WON'T WE?

     LARCH APPROACHES RIANNE.  SHE SQUIRMS.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (BEAT)
               YOU TOUCH HER, YOU'RE DEAD.

                         GENERAL
               OH, SON, SPARE ME.
                    (BEAT)
               IT'S OVER, SERGEANT.  NO HEROES
               AROUND TO SAVE YOU ...

     HE PICKS UP A BASEBALL BAT.  TOSSES IT TO LARCH.

                         GENERAL
               MR. LARCH... SHE'S YOURS.

     RIANNE  SCREAMS.  MURTAUGH  SHOUTS.  STRAINS.  THE   CHAIR
     THUMPS UP AND DOWN, CREATING  AN  INSANE,  STACCATO  RHYTHM.
     THE  GENERAL  LAUGHS.  RIANNE  SHRIEKS.  HARROWING.   TERRI-
     BLE. A SCENE OUT OF HELL.  AND  THEN  THE  DEVIL  COMES  IN
     AND KICKS THE  DOOR  OFF  ITS  HINGES.  OKAY.  OKAY.  LET'S
     STOP FOR A MOMENT. FIRST  OFF,  TO  DESCRIBE  FULLY  THE
     MAYHEM WHICH RIGGS NOW CREATES WOULD  NOT  DO  IT  JUSTICE.
     HERE, HOWEVER, ARE A FEW POINTERS:  HE IS NOT FLASHY.
     HE IS NOT CHUCK NORRIS.  RATHER, HE IS LIKE A SLEDGE-
     HAMMER HITTING AN EGG. HE  DOES  NOT  KNOCK  PEOPLE  DOWN.
     HE DOES NOT  INJURE  THEM.

     HE SIMPLY  KILLS  THEM.  THE  WHOLE ROOM.  EVERYONE   STAND-
     ING. EXCEPT  FOR  --  THE  GENERAL, WHO DUCKS OUT A SIDE
     DOOR AND ESCAPES ...  RIGGS'  CHAIN MOVES LIKE A LIVE THING.
     SNAPPING HERE.  STRIKING THERE.    MERCS TRY TO  DRAW  THEIR
     GUNS -- AND SUDDENLY THEIR HANDS ARE SHATTERED WRECKS.
     ONE MERC DRAWS A  BEAD  ON  RIANNE, ALMOST GETS OFF  A  SHOT,
     BECAUSE RIGGS IS ACROSS THE ROOM.  WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT
     -- RIGGS THROWS THE CHAIN. IT  WRAPS  THE  GUY'S  NECK  AND
     KILLS HIM INSTANTLY. OUCH ... HE  GOES  DOWN,  FIRING  USE-
     LESS ROUNDS  INTO  THE  CEILING.  PLASTER  RAINS.  RIGGS
     SPINS, DIVES. SCOOPS  UP  THE  BASEBALL  BAT.  COMES  UP
     BESIDE AN ARMED MERC -- SWINGS THE BAT WITH HURRICANE
     FORCE. A SICKENING  IMPACT.  THE  BAT  BREAKS  IN  HALF.
     RIGGS SPINS, COMBAT-READY.  SCANS  THE  ROOM.  NO  ONE  LEFT
     TO KILL. USING ONLY THE  ELEMENT  OF  SURPRISE,  HE  HAS
     TAKEN OUT AN ENTIRE  ROOM  IN  HAND-TO-HAND  COMBAT.  HE
     STEPS IN FRONT OF MURTAUGH  WITHOUT  MISSING  A  BEAT.  CUTS
     HIM LOOSE WITH  A  BORROWED  KNIFE.

                         RIGGS
               WORK  YOUR  CIRCULATION.

     CROSSES TO RIANNE, CUTS  HER  FREE.  SHE  COLLAPSES  SOBBING
     INTO HIS ARMS.

                         RIGGS
               SSSHHH-  NO TIME.  COME ON.

     HE SCOOPS UP HANDGUNS,  THROWS  THEM  TO  MURTAUGH.  TAKES
     FOR HIMSELF A PUMP SHOTGUN, POSSIBLY  THE  SAME  ONE  USED
     AGAINST HIM EARLIER.  MURTAUGH STARES DUMBFOUNDED AT THE
     BODY COUNT.

                         RIGGS
               THEY'RE ALL DEAD.  LET'S GET
               OUT OF HERE.

143  EXT. HALLWAY -  SAME  TIME                             143

     THE THREE OF THEM.

     ON THE RUN, MOVING HARD AND  FAST.  THEY  SCRAMBLE  DOWN  THE
     HALLWAY, RIGGS IN THE LEAD, AS -- A  MERC  DUCKS  AROUND  THE
     CORNER, SEES THEM.  DUCKS BACK.  RIGGS FIRES THROUGH THE
     WALL, BLAM -- !  A CORPSE FALLS INTO VIEW.  THEY KEEP
     MOVING.  DOWNSTAIRS.  A-ROUND ANOTHER CORNER.  MOVING,
     MOVING.

     THE THREE OF THEM  KEEP  MOVING.  RUSHING  HEADLONG  TOWARD
     A SIGN MARKED EXIT. THEY MAY ACTUALLY MAKE  IT  ...  OR  NOT.
     FOR AT THAT MOMENT, MR. JOSHUA LOOMS  UP  BEHIND  THEM  AND
     TOSSES SOMETHING IN THEIR  DIRECTION.  DUCKS  BACK  OUT  OF
     SIGHT. IT'S A LIVE  GRENADE.  THE  GRENADE  HITS  THE  FLOOR.
     CLATTERS.  RIGGS STOPS INSTANTLY.  HE KNOWS THE SOUND.
     SPINS. DIVES. SCOOPS UP  THE  GRENDADE  AND  CHUCKS  IT  WITH
     ALL HIS MIGHT. IT BOUNCES  DOWNSTAIRS  AND  EXPLODES  AT  THE
     FOOT OF THE STEPS.

144  EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT                                          144

     JOSHUA SKIDS TO A HALT NEXT TO A SEDAN.

     HE SLAMS THE DOOR AND ROARS  OFF  DOWN  HOLLYWOOD  BOULEVARD.
     THE CROWD PARTS LIKE THE RED SEA.  PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING.
     AND SUDDENLY, THE DOORS BURST OPEN -- AS RIGGS, MURTAUGH
     AND RIANNE COME SKIDDING OUT ONTO THE SIDEWALK IN HOT
     PURSUIT.  MURTAUGH SHOVES HIS DAUGHTER BACK AS JOSHUA
     FIRES OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAR.  BULLETS LASH THE PAVE-
     MENT.  THE CROWD SHRIEKS.  THE CAR SCREECHES AWAY.

145  ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  145

     A BEAT COP COMES RUNNING UP,  AND  MURTAUGH  SHOVES  RIANNE
     IN HIS DIRECTION.  FLASHES HIS BADGE.

                         MURTAUGH
               GET HER OUT OF HERE.

146  ANOTHER ANGLE - MURTAUGH AND RIGGS                             146

     GO RUNNING AFTER THE CAR.  SIDE BY SIDE.  BEATEN.  BLOODY.
     NAKED FROM THE WAIST UP.  MURTAUGH FIRING HIS PISTOL.  SHOT
     AFTER BLAZING SHOT.

     RIGGS UNLOADING WITH THE M-16 ON THREE-SHOT MODE, THE
     MUZZLE FLASH BLINDING, THE NOISE DEAFENING -- UNTIL
     PEDESTRIANS SWARM SUDDENLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE.
     BLOCKING THEM. EXCEPT  MURTAUGH  WON'T  GIVE  UP.  HE  RUNS
     AFTER THE CAR, SHOUTING:

                         MURTAUGH
               OUT OF THE WAY.  MOVE.

     HIS GUN CLICKS  EMPTY.  HE  TOSSES  IT  ASIDE.  PULLS  ANOTHER
     FROM HIS WAISTBAND.  THE  CAR.  FAR  AWAY.  FIRES  FOUR  MORE
     SHOTS.  COLLAPSES IN THE STREET.  NEARLY' UNCONSCIOUS.
     CRAWLS FORWARD AFTER THE CAR, BLOOD  STREAMING  FROM  HIS
     BROKEN NOSE ... GOING ON SHEER  GUTS.  FINALLY  GIVES  OUT.
     SLUMPS IN A HEAP. RIGGS KNEELS BESIDE  HIM  AS  A  POLICE  CAR
     ROARS UP TO THEM, FLASHERS  SPINNING.  RIGGS  IS  A  MAN  POS-
     SESSED. WE PANA-GLIDE  WITH  HIM  AS  HE  RUNS  FORWARD.  M-16
     IN ONE HAND.  BADGE IN THE OTHER.

                         RIGGS
               GET AN AMBULANCE!!

     HE TAKES OFF AFTER THE JOSHUA'S CAR.  ON FOOT.  SOMEONE
     BETTER TELL THIS GUY TO LIGHTEN UP.  THE CAR IS FAR AHEAD,
     RACING ONTO A FREEWAY ON-RAMP.  RIGGS RUNS.  SWEAT POURS
     OFF HIM.  SEEING THE CAR ON THE RAMP, HE CHANGES DIRECTION.
     STARTS RUNNING AN INTERCEPT  COURSE.  LEAPS  OUT  INTO  THE
     STREET -- SPINS, AS A TRUCK  BLARES  OUT  OF  NOWHERE,  BRAKES
     SQUEALING, HORN  SHRIEKING.  SOMERSAULTS  OVER  THE  HOOD.
     LANDS.  KEEPS  MOVING.  BARRELS  ACROSS  THE  STREET.   FASTER
     NOW.  EVEN FASTER THAN BEFORE.  FEET POUNDING.  GUN
     SWINGING.  DASHING  OUT  ONTO  THE  FREEWAY  OVERPASS.  WHERE,
     WITHOUT STOPPING,  HE  PROMPTLY  JUMPS  THE  GUARDRAIL.  DROPS
     THROUGH SPACE ... AND LANDS, THUMP -- !  ATOP THE BIG
     GREEN FREEWAY SIGN.  SWINGS LIKE AN ACROBAT.  DANGLES
     FROM THE SIGN, TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.  LEVELS THE
     M-16 ONE-HANDED, SWITCHES IT TO FULL AUTO.  WAITS ...

147  BENEATH HIM                                                     147

     JOSHUA'S CAR COMES  SCREAMING  THROUGH  THE  UNDERPASS,  DOING
     EIGHTY. RIGGS UNLEASHES  THE  GUN.  IT  BLAZES  WITH  CRUEL
     FIRE. STPAFES THE BACK  OF  THE  CAR.  SURE  ENOUGH,  BLOWS
     OUT BOTH TIRES -- THROWING THE  VEHICLE  INTO  A  DEADLY  SKID
     -- SLEWING ACROSS THE FREEWAY  --  STRIKING  THE  GUARDRAIL
     AT SIXTY-PLUS. IT SLIDES  FOR  A  FULL  HUNDRED  YARDS,  SEND-
     ING UP A SHOWER OF  SPARKS.  THE  BACK  TIRES  DISINTEGRATE
     IN A TRAIL OF BURNING RUBBER.  THE CAR GRINDS TO A HALT.
     THE DOOR OPENS  AND  JOSHUA  ROLLS  OUT.  RIGGS  FIRES.  KICKS
     UP A CLOUD OF CEMENT  NEAR  THE  MERC.  JOSHUA  RETURNS  FIRE.

148  ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   148

     BIG CHUNKS OF THE.FREEWAY SIGN BLOW  OUT  NEXT  TO  RIGGS'
     .HEAD.  HE IS SHOWERED WITH WOODEN DEBRIS.

     RIGGS LOWERS THE GUN.  LETS GO AND DROPS TWENTY FEET TO
     THE PAVEMENT.  LANDS, ROLLS, COMES UP.  A CAR SWERVES
     AROUND HIM.  CRASHES INTO THE GUARDRAIL.  RIGGS DOESN'T
     EVEN LOOK.  INSTEAD, HE BEGINS TO WALK.  HE IS A FUCKING
     JUGGERNAUT.

149  UP AHEAD                                                    149

     JOSHUA TURNS, SEES RIGGS -- AND STOPS.

                         JOSHUA
               OKAY, YOU BASTARD, LET'S SEE
               WHO'S BETTER.

     THEY ARE SEPARATED BY PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS.  JOSHUA
     SNAPS HIS RIFLE TO HIS SHOULDER. EYES GLUED TO  THE  SCOPE.
     RIGGS SWINGS HIS OWN RIFLE INTO POSITION -- AND  WE'VE  GOT
     THE SHOWDOWN AT THE O.K. CORRAL. A  BATTLE  OF  WITS.  EACH
     ONE SCANNING THROUGH THE SCOPE.

     LOOKING FOR A CLEAR SHOT, AS CARS SWERVE AROUND AND
     BETWEEN THEM. THE CROSSHAIRS  SWEEP  THE  FREEWAY.  PERFECT
     CONCENTRATION.  RIGGS.  JOSHUA.  TWO SOLDIERS.  AND
     SUDDENLY, THE SHOT IS THERE:  JOSHUA SIGHTS IN ON RIGGS'
     POSITION. ONLY PROBLEM IS, RIGGS' RIFLE  IS  POINTED  RIGHT
     AT THE CAMERA. HE IS SIGHTED IN  ON  JOSHUA.  SIMULTANEOUS.
     THEY FIRE AT THE EXACT SAME MOMENT.  TWO SHOTS.  TWO
     DISTINCT RIFLE CRACKS.  RIGGS TAKES IT IN THE SHOULDER.
     BLOWN BACKWARD.  JOSHUA GOES DOWN, WINGED.  RIGGS.
     JOSHUA.  EACH LOOKS LIKE SHIT.  THEY STRUGGLE TO THEIR
     FEET ... AND THAT'S WHEN A CAR BACKS UP INTO RIGGS AT
     THIRTY MILES AN HOUR. BROADSIDES  HIM.  SENDS  HIM  FLYING.

150  UP AHEAD                                                     150

     JOSHUA RUSHES UP TO A STALLED CAR. THROWS  OPEN  THE  DOOR.
     YANKS OUT THE DRIVER, HOPS BEHIND THE  WHEEL.  ROARS  AWAY.

                                               CUT TO:

151  EXT. BUILDING - SAME TIME                                    151

     AN AMBULANCE SHUDDERS TO A HALT AND TWO ORDERLIES HOP
     OUT.  UNIFORMED COPS ARE STRUGGLING TO HOLD BACK THE
     CROWD.  ONE OF THE ORDERLIES RUSHES UP.

                         ORDERLY
               WHERE IS HE, OFFICER?

                         COP
               RIGHT OVER THERE.

     HE POINTS -- AND SUDDENLY FROWNS: THERE IS  NO  ONE  THERE.
     MURTAUGH IS GONE.  NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

                                                       CUT TO:

152  EXT. BACK ALLEY - SAME TIME                                   152

     A SLEEK BLACK VAN CAREENS AROUND THE CORNER.

152A INT. VAN                                                      152A

     A MERC IS DRIVING, FOOT GLUED TO THE PEDAL.  THE GENERAL
     SITS SWEATING IN THE BACK SEAT.

152B ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 152B

     THE HEADLIGHTS FLASH WILDLY AS THE CAR ROARS DOWN THE
     ALLEY.

     THE GENERAL STARES AHEAD, AND SUDDENLY ------- ...
     'CAUSE WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, THERE'S ROGER MURTAUGH.
     FIFTY YARDS AWAY.  STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.

153  ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 153

     THERE IS NO REASON FOR MURTAUGH TO BE STANDING.  HE IS A
     WALKING TESTAMENT TO MAN'S ABILITY TO BLOODY HIMSELF.
     AND HE'S PISSED... THE MERC  SEES  HIM,  SNARLS  --  PUNCHES
     THE GAS.  MURTAUGH HOLDS HIS GROUND.  HE CAN BARELY STAND.
     AND THEN HE DOES A PECULIAR THING:  HE EXAMINES HIS HAND.
     NO QUESTION.  A DEFINITE TREMBLE.  SCOWLS.  STRETCHES.
     CRACKS HIS NECK.

     SHIFTS FROM FOOT TO FOOT, STEADYING HIMSELF.  HE HAS ONE
     SHOT. THE NUMBERS ARE  FALLING,  IT'S  ALL  COMING  DOWN  --
     AND HE'S READY.  THE VAN COMES BARRELING IN.  DOING FIFTY.
     NOW OR NEVER...

                         MURTAUGH
               NO WAY YOU LIVE.  NO WAY.

     HE CROSS-DRAWS WITH LIGHTNING SWIFTNESS.  BAM.  THE
     REPORT IS DEAFENING.  THE WINDSHIELD PROMPTLY SHATTERS.
     AND THE MERC SPROUTS A NEAT THIRD EYE.  PERFECT SHOT.
     DEAD CENTER.  THE VAN SWERVES.  MURTAUGH STEPS OUT OF THE
     WAY.  DEADLY CALM.  AS THE VAN CAREENS PAST -- HE SALUTES
     THE GENERAL.  WATCHES, EXPRESSIONLESS ... THE CAR SLAMS
     INTO A TELEPHONE POLE AND ROLLS OVER.  GRINDING METAL.
     AN ERUPTION OF GLASS.  IT CONTINUES TO ROLL LIKE SOME
     GREAT BEAST, CRUMPLING  AND  FOLDING  LIKE  AN  ACCORDION...

     COMES TO REST, UPSIDE DOWN IN A SEA OF GLASS ...

153A INT. VAN                                             153A

     THE GENERAL IS PINNED BENEATH A CRUMPLED DOOR-FRAME,
     STRUGGLING TO BREAK FREE, AS FLAMES LICK UPWARD FROM THE
     RUPTURED GAS TANK...

     AND THEN THE GENERAL SEES SOMETHING WHICH RUINS HIS WHOLE
     DAY.

     THE MERC'S CORPSE,  SPRAWLED  OVER  THE  STEERING  COLUMN...     *
     WITH A SHINY METAL GRENADE ATTACHED TO HIS BELT.                 *
     FLAMES DANCE AROUND THE GRENADE.                                 *

153C ANOTHER ANGLE                                                    153C *

     THE GENERAL SQUIRMS, STRAINS, YANKS FOR ALL HE'S WORTH...        *
     FINGERS REACHING OUT FOR THE GRENADE...........................  *
     FLAMES BURNING HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND...........................  *

     AND IT IS, AS THEY SAY, ALL SHE WROTE.                           *
154  EXT. ROADWAY                                                     154

     MURTAUGH IS WALKING LIKE A ZOMBIE.  AWAY FROM THE VAN.
     GUN HELD LOOSELY AT HIS  SIDE.  SUDDENLY  --  IT  BLOWS  SKY
     HIGH.  A TOWER OF FIRE.  BLOWS MURTAUGH FLAT.  KNOCKS
     HIM ASS OVER TEACUPS.  ECHOES DOWN THE STREET.  TURNS
     NIGHT INTO DAY FOR ONE  BRIEF  INSTANT.  AND  THEN  --  THEN
     SOMETHING TRULY  INCREDIBLE  HAPPENS.  FOR  THE  FIRST  TIME
     IN NEARLY A CENTURY -- IT BEGINS TO SNOW IN HOLLYWOOD.
     MURTAUGH LOOKS UP, A "WHAT THE HELL ... ?" EXPRESSION ON
     HIS FACE.  SURE ENOUGH --

155  HEROIN                                                           155

     IS SIFTING DOWN ON THE NIGHT AIR, TEN MILLION DOLLARS'
     WORTH... A CLOUD OVER THE ENTIRE' STREET.  SWIRLING IN
     THE BREEZE.

156  MURTAUGH                                                    156

     GETS SLOWLY TO HIS FEET, CHECKING FOR BROKEN BONES.  IF
     IT WASN'T BUSTED ALREADY, APPARENTLY IT'S OKAY NOW.  TIME
     PASSES.  A HAND RESTS ON HIS SHOULDER.

157  MARTIN RIGGS                                                157

     STANDS NEXT TO HIM.  COPS SWARM BEHIND THEM.  THE HEROIN
     SNOW CONTINUES TO FALL.  THE WRECK BURNS.  RIGGS LOOKS AT
     MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH LOOKS AT RIGGS.  THE TWO MOST PHYSI-
     CALLY ABUSED MEN IN FILM HISTORY.

                         MURTAUGH
               WELL, SHIT.

                         RIGGS
               TRY NOT TO BREATHE, YOU'LL SEE
               PINK ELEPHANTS.

                         MURTAUGH
               JOSHUA?

                         RIGGS
               GOT AWAY.

                         MURTAUGH
               WE ... GOTTA FIND HIM.

                         RIGGS
               NO DICE.  FIRST THING WE GOTTA DO
               IS GET YOU TO A HOSPITAL.

                         MURTAUGH
               UH-HUH  FIRST THING WE GOTTA DO
               IS CHECK ON MY HOUSE.
                    (BEAT)
               I GOT A BAD FEELING...

     HE MOVES AWAY.  RIGGS STARTS TO FOLLOW.  GOES TO TOSS HIS
     CIGARETTE IN THE GUTTER, AND STOPS:  THERE IS A TINY, RED
     MARK AT THE TIP OF THE FILTER:  IT IS THE CIGARETTE.  THE
     VERY LAST ONE ... HE STARES AT IT, A SUDDEN GLIMMER IN HIS
     EYE.

                                             CUT TO:

158  EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT                                  158

     THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS SHED A HAPPY GLOW.  THE LAWN IS
     STILL LITTERED WITH TOYS.  TWO UNIFORMED COPS ARE WATCH-
     ING OVER THE HOUSE, SITTING IN A POLICE CAR ACROSS THE
     STREET.  ONE OF THEM MUNCHES ON A SANDWICH.  THE OTHER
     IS DOING A CROSSWORD PUZZLE.  A CAR PULLS UP NEXT TO
     THEM.  THE DOOR OPENS -- OUT STEPS MR. JOSHUA.

                         POLICE OFFICER
               EXCUSE ME, SIR, MAY I SEE SOME
               ID?

     JOSHUA TAKES AN UZI FROM BENEATH  HIS  COAT.  NO  HESI-
     TATION. BLOWS  THEM  APART.  WALKS  FORWARD,  GUN  SMOKING.
     CROSSES THE LAWN TO THE FRONT DOOR.  KICKS IT TO
     SPLINTERS.

159  EXT. CITY STREET - SAME TIME                                   159

     A POLICE CAR PEELS AROUND THE CORNER.  TAKES OUT A
     SALVATION ARMY BUCKET, WHICH POPS LIKE A CLAY DUCK.
     COINS SHOWER EVERY WHICH WAY.

160  INT. CAR                                                       160

     MURTAUGH IS DRIVING LIKE A  LUNATIC.  BESIDE  HIM,  RIGGS
     HOLDS A HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS GUNSHOT WOUND.

161  INT. MURTAUGH HOME'- SAME TIME                                 161

     JOSHUA STALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY OF MURTAUGH'S HOUSE.
     STOPS IN FRONT OF THE BEDROOM DOOR.  HOLY JESUS ...   HE
     KICKS IT OPEN.  SPPAYS  THE  INTERIOR  WITH  GUNFIRE.  SHREDS
     THE MATTRESS, DICES  THE  PILLOWS.  TRASHES  EVERYTHING  IN
     SIGHT:  STAR WARS POSTERS.  STUFFED ANIMALS.  STEREO.
     EMPTIES AN ENTIRE CLIP OF  .9  MILLIMETER  SLUGS.  EXCEPT
     THE BED IS EMPTY. THERE  IS  NO  ONE  THERE.  JOSHUA  SNARLS.
     TURNS.

162  SERIES OF SHOTS                                                162

     KICKS OPEN ANOTHER DOOR.  TRIGGERS DESTRUCTION.  PLASTER
     AND WOOD FILL THE AIR IN  A  CLOUD.  ROOM  TO  ROOM.  SEARCH-
     ING. GROWING MORE AND MORE  ENRAGED  --  BECAUSE  THERE  IS
     NO ONE HERE TO KILL. HE IS BLOWING THE  SHIT  OUT  OF  AN
     EMPTY SANTA MONICA BUNGALOW.  HE BURSTS INTO THE ONLY
     ROOM HE HASN'T VISITED.  LIVING ROOM.  IT TOO, IS EMPTY.
     THERE IS A NOTE, HOWEVER.  TAPED  TO  THE  CHRISTMAS  TREE:
     BIG LETTERS.

     DEAR BADGUYS

     NO ONE HERE BUT US COPS.
     SORRY.

     -- THE GOODGUYS

     JOSHUA SWEARS. RUNS FOR THE  DOOR.  AND  A  POLICE  CAR
     DRIVES THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE  HOUSE.  PLOWS  INTO  THE
     LIVING ROOM, SHEARING BOARDS  IN  HALF,  BURSTING  WINDOWS,
     GRINDING TO A HAL-. IN A SEA OF  GLASS.  JOSHUA  SPINS,
     TRIGGERING THE UZI.-  STRAFES THE CAR.  A WITHERING FIRE.

     EMPTIES AN ENTIRE CLIP AT  THE  FRONT  WINDSHIELD,  DICING
     IT TO SMITHEREENS. WAVES THE  GUN  LIKE  A  WAND,  STRAFING
     X PATTERNS, FIRING ALL THE WHILE, COMPLETELY EXTINGUISH-
     ING THE CAR AND ALL LIFE WITHIN.  STOPS.  SILENCE.
     FLOATING DEBRIS.  JOSHUA LOWERS THE GUN.  BREATHING HARD.

     CROSSES  THE ROOM, HIS BOOTS CRUNCHING THROUGH BROKEN
     GLASS.   YANKS ON THE DRIVER'S DOOR.  IT FALLS LOOSE WITH
     A METAL  CLANG.

163  ANOTHER  ANGLE                                             163

     A COP'S  NIGHTSTICK HAS BEEN JAMMED AGAINST THE ACCEL-
     ERATOR PEDAL.  THE CAR IS EMPTY.

     JOSHUA SPINS, STARTLED
     STARES ACROSS THE ROOM

     AT MARTIN RIGGS, WHO SITS CALMLY  ON  THE  WINDOWSILL.

                         RIGGS
               HO, HO, HO.

     HE RAISES HIS GUN AND FIRES WITHOUT BLINKING.
     BLOWS THE GUN OUT OF JOSHUA'S HANDS.
     SMILES A BIG SHIT-EATING GRIN.

     JOSHUA TURNS AND DIVES THROUGH THE HOLE  IN  THE  WALL
     LANDS OUTSIDE, COMES UP RUNNING, BUT  SORRY,  NO  DICE
     BECAUSE THERE STANDS ROGER  MURTAUGH.  DRAWING  A  BEAD  ON
     JOSHUA'S RUNNING FIGURE.

                         MURTAUGH
               FREEZE, JOSHUA.

     JOSHUA STOPS DEAD. TURNS,  GROWLING  LOW  IN  HIS  THROAT.
     A FIRE HYDRANT, SHEARED OFF BY  THE  RUNAWAY  CAR,  SPRAYS
     WATER HIGH INTO THE NIGHTTIME  AIR.  THE  WIND  BLOWS.
     MARTIN RIGGS STEPS OUT OF  THE  HOUSE.  POINTING  THE  .38
     SPECIAL LIKE A FINGER OF DOOM.  STROLLS TOWARD MR.
     JOSHUA... THE GUN IS ROCK  STEADY.  RIGGS'  EYES  MEET
     MURTAUGH'S, AND HE SPEAKS WITH DEADLY PURPOSE:

                         RIGGS
               I'LL HANDLE IT.

     HE STEPS UP TO JOSHUA.  SMILES.  AND  THEN  HE  DOES  SOME-
     THING VERY STRANGE: HE RELAXES HIS  GRIP  ON  THE  GUN  --
     AND THROWS IT AWAY.  FACES JOSHUA.  RAISES HIS ARMS, AND
     CAREFULLY PLACES THEM BEHIND  HIS  HEAD.  WHEN  HE  SPEAKS,
     HIS VOICE DRIPS MENACE:

                         RIGGS
               COME ON, ACE.
                    (BEAT)
               TRY ME.

     A MOMENT. THEN JOSHUA CALMLY PLANTS  HIMSELF  IN  FRONT  OF
     RIGGS.  AROUND THEM, WATER SHOWERS DOWN IN A GENTLE CLOUD.
     SIRENS APPROACH IN THE NEAR  DISTANCE.  JOSHUA  AND  RIGGS.
     TWO SOLDIERS.  THEIR EYES LOCK.  AND YOU BETTER HANG ONTO
     YOUR POPCORN, BOYS AND GIRLS, BECAUSE IT'S  ABOUT  TO  GET
     UGLY.

                         JOSHUA
               DON'T MIND IF I DO.

     AND SO IT BEGINS.  THEY START TO CIRCLE.

     RIGGS AND JOSHUA, PERFECT CONCENTRATION,  ROUND  AND  ROUND
     AND NEVER, NEVER ONCE DOES THEIR FOCUS BREAK, BECAUSE,
     BABY, THESE GUYS ARE PROS -- AND  HERE'S  SOMETHING  FUNNY:
     THEY AREN'T LOOKING AT EACH OTHER'S  EYES  AT  ALL.  RATHER
     -- THEY'RE WATCHING EACH OTHER'S HANDS.

164  RIGGS                                                        164

     HIS FINGERS TWITCH. FLEX.  WRIST  MAKING  SLOW,  LABORIOUS-
     CIRCLES.

165  JOSHUA                                                       165

     SHIFTING FROM LEG TO LEG, FLOATING HIS BALANCE.

166  MURTAUGH                                                     166

     LOOKS ON, SWEATING IT OUT. HE'S  NOT  HAPPY,  HE  WANTS  TO
     END IT ... AND YET HE WAITS.

167  RIGGS AND JOSHUA                                             167

     ALL WE SEE IS THEIR  EYES,  STRAINING,  FOCUSING,  SCANNING
     FOR AN OPENING.

                         JOSHUA
               CONCENTRATE, MARTIN... DON'T GIVE
               ME AN OPENING... WOULDN'T WANT TO
               DO THAT ...

     RIGGS SHIFTS.  BLINKS.  AND:

168  JOSHUA                                                       168

     SPRINGS ... FOOT COMING OUT  LIKE  A  SHOT,  RIGGS  JERKING
     BACK, INCHES -- MEANWHILE,  RIGGS  --  COUNTERMOVE,  SPINS,
     TRIES A BACK KICK, NO DICE ... JOSHUA NO LONGER THERE,
     WHERE IS HE ... ? SHIT -- ! COMES UP,  DARTS  A  PUNCH  TO

          RIGGS' NECK -- RIGGS FIELDS IT, SNAP
          THE LEP-.  IT COMES OU@T OF NOWHERE.

-------------------------------

     CRACK!  THE SOUND OF RIGGS' RIB BREAKING CARRIES CLEARLY.
     HE GRUNTS.  THRUSTS, INVITING A COUNTERMOVE ... JOSHUA
     COUNTERS -- AND RIGGS SNAGS HIS HAND, PICTURE-FUCKING-
     PERFECT.  BREAKS ONE OF JOSHUA'S FINGERS.  OUCH.  BACKS
     OFF.  JOSHUA BACKS OFF.  THE TWO OF THEM.  WOUNDED, THEY
     CIRCLE.  ROUND TWO ...

169  MURTAUGH                                                      169

     MEANWHILE, IS RAISING HIS GUN, POINTING IT AT JOSHUA.
     RIGGS' VOICE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE:

                         RIGGS
               NO. ROGER.
                    (BEAT)
               NO WAY.

     MURTAUGH LOWERS THE GUN.  STARES, FASCINATED, AT THIS
     CONTEST BETWEEN TWO CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONALS.  IN FOR THE
     KILL.  IT IS A DANCE OF THE FORCES.  RIGGS IS ON FIRE.
     LEAPS, AVOIDING A SHOT TO THE KNEE, SPINS, SLAMS THE
     KNUCKLES OF HIS HAND INTO JOSHUA'S NOSE.  BUSTS IT.
     JOSHUA SNARLS, DROPS -- CATCHES RIGGS' ARM OVER ONE
     SHOULDER.  AND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... RIGGS HAS JUST
     FUCKED UP.  CRACK -- !  HIS ARM BREAKS.  HE SCREAMS WITH
     PAIN.  SCREAMS WITH ANGER.  TOSSES THREE SHOTS AT JOSHUA.
     SNAP.  SNAP.  SNAP.  RIBS, SPLINTERING.  JOSHUA HISSING
     WITH PAIN.  LETS GO.  BACK OFF (RIGGS).  BACK OFF (JOSHUA).
     IN PAIN, THEY CIRCLE.  ROUND THREE ...

                         JOSHUA
               THAT'S IT, MARTIN... YOUR BODY
               WANTS TO GO INTO SHOCK... BUT YOU
               WON'T LET IT, WILL YOU ... ?

                         RIGGS
               ...  GIVE IT UP ... YOUR BREATHING'S
               SHOT  ...

                         JOSHUA
               SO'S YOUR LEFT ARM...

                         RIGGS
               LIFE'S TOUGH THAT WAY ... OH, BY
               THE WAY:  FUCK YOU.

     HE LAUNCHES HIMSELF AT JOSHUA.  JOSHUA STRIKES, SCORES A
     MINOR POINT, BREAKING RIGGS' COLLARBONE, EXCEPT RIGGS
     DOESN'T CARE, NOSIRREE BOB... 'CAUSE HE JUST HIT PAYDIRT:
     JOSHUA'S KNEE.  BOOT-STRIKES, BAM -- !  SHEARING THE
     KNEE, MAYBE BURSTING THE CAP ... JOSHUA SHRIEKS, BUT THEN
     AGAIN, SO WOULD YOU.  AND HE PROMPTLY JACK-KNIVES HIS
     FIST RIGHT INTO RIGGS' BROKEN ARM.  THREE TIMES.  RIGGS
     BELLOWS.  REFUSES TO QUIT.

     SLAMS HIS HEAD INTO JOSHUA'S BUSTED NOSE.  POP ...
     DOES IT AGAIN. JOSHUA, HAMMERING THE  BROKEN  ARM.  POW.
     (SCREAM)  POW.  (SCREAM) ... UNTIL, SON OF A BITCH... THE
     PAIN IS SIMPLY TOO INTENSE... NOTHING HUMAN CAN WITHSTAND
     IT, THEY FALL AWAY, STAGGERING, WRENCHING TO A SHAKY HALT,
     FACING ONE ANOTHER, STANDOFF ... EXHAUSTED, LIMPING, HARDLY
     ABLE TO SPEAK...

170  POLICE CARS                                                  170

     PULLING UP NOW, COPS STUMBLING OUT, GUNS CLEARING  THEIR
     HOLSTERS AS MURTAUGH WAVES FRANTICALLY, SCREAMS:

                         MURTAUGH
               NO GUNS.  LET IT GO!  GODDAMMIT,
               LET IT GO!!

     SPITS, GAZES STRAIGHT AT JOSHUA.  JOSHUA STARES BACK.
     TWO SOLDIERS.  THIS CLOSE TO COLLAPSING.  UNTIL, BREAKING
     THE SILENCE -- COMES MURTAUGH'S VOICE:

                         MURTAUGH
               MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.

                            MURTAUGH
               -----------
               THE MOTHERFUCKER.

     A MOMENT ... AND THEN, MY FRIENDS, RIGGS DOES A PECULIAR
     THING:  HE SMILES THEN.  DAMNED IF HE DOESN'T.  AND RISES
     UP ... STANDING. STANDING STRAIGHT. THERE IS NO  WAY  HE
     SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS.  AND THEN HE SPEAKS, AND IT'S
     LIKE THE VOICE OF DOOM, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE KNOW THAT
     THIS GUY IS A FUCKING LEGEND, WE KNOW WHY THE V.C. EN-
     FORCERS WHISPERED HIS NAME AT NIGHT IN THE FOXHOLES ...
     HE IS RIGGS.  AND NO ONE CAN TOUCH HIM.  NO ONE.

                         RIGGS
               LAST CHANCE.  WALK AWAY.

                         JOSHUA
               FUCK YOURSELF.

                         RIGGS
               FINE.  DIE.

     HE STEPS FORWARD.  STANDS.  JOSHUA SPRINGS -- THUNDERS
     HIS FOOT INTO RIGGS' HIP, SEPARATING THE BONE AT THE
     JOINT ... AND RIGGS DOESN'T BLINK.  HIS HAND COMES OUT.
     LIGHTNING QUICK.

     THERE IS A SICK-SOUNDING CRACK -- AND JOSHUA IS DEAD
     BEFORE HE HITS THE GROUND.  RIGGS HOVERS OVER THE
     CORPSE... BREATHING SPASTIC, SALIVA DRIPPING FROM HIS
     LIPS... TAKES A HANDKERCHIEF, WIPES HIS HAND, AND SAYS:

                         RIGGS
               YOU LOSE.

     AT WHICH POINT, HE COLLAPSES LIKE A SACK OF GRAIN.

172  MURTAUGH                                                         172

     IS RUNNING FORWARD, TEARS IN HIS EYES BY THIS TIME, FALLS
     TO HIS KNEES, CRADLING RIGGS IN HIS ARMS, WHILE THE
     ASSEMBLED COPS LOOK ON IN THOROUGHLY STUNNED SILENCE,
     WHAT THEY HAVE JUST SEEN IS BEYOND THEIR WILDEST
     IMAGINING ...

173  ON GROUND                                                        173

     RIGGS LOOKS AT MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH LOOKS AT RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               TAKE IT EASY, MARTIN...

                         RIGGS
               ... RIGHT.  EASY.  YOU BET ...

                         MURTAUGH
               DOES IT HURT ... ?

     RIGGS  THROWS  HIM  A  LOOK.

                         RIGGS
               WHAT ARE YOU, AN IDIOT?

                         MURTAUGH
               SORRY.

                         RIGGS
               S'ALL RIGHT.
                    (BEAT)
               I GOT GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S THE GOOD NEWS?

                         RIGGS
               ... GOOD NEWS IS, I'M NOT DEAD...

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?

     RIGGS GRIMACES IN PAIN-

                         RIGGS
               ... BAD NEWS IS, I'M STILL ALIVE ...

     HE CHUCKLES.  GROANS.  PASSES OUT.  THE WATER RAINS
     STEADILY DOWN.  THE NIGHT WEARS ON...

     CUT TO:

174  EXT. LONG BEACH BAR - DAY                                  174

     CHRISTMAS CAROLERS SING OUTSIDE AT ROADSIDE.  A BIG
     BANNER SCREAMS MERRY CHRISTMAS TO PASSING CARS.  CHRIST-
     MAS LIGHTS.  TINSEL.  MURTAUGH AND RIGGS STAND ON THE
     SIDEWALK, HUDDLED AGAINST THE CHILL.  RIGGS STANDS,
     BRACED ON ONE CRUTCH.  ARM IN A SLING.  THEIR BREATH
     PLUMES OUT IN FRONT OF THEM.

                         MURTAUGH
               SO.

                         RIGGS
               SO.

                         MURTAUGH
               THERE ARE WORSE THINGS THAN A
               PSYCH PENSION.

                         RIGGS
                    (SHRUGS)
               PROBABLY.

                         MURTAUGH
               GUESS I WON'T BE SEEING YOU
               AROUND.

                         RIGGS
               GUESS NOT.
                    (BEAT)
               THE DEPARTMENT THINKS I'M WILD.
               I DON'T BELONG ANYMORE.  NOT
               HERE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHERE DO YOU BELONG?

                         RIGGS
               WHO KNOWS ... ?  MAYBE I CAN GET
               A JOB ON A REMAKE OF COBRA.

                         MURTAUGH
               MY SON WOULD COME SEE YOU.

                         RIGGS
               HE'D BE THE ONLY ONE.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (A PAUSE;
                     THEN)
               RIGGS.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               THIS ... IS A BAD OLD WORLD,
               ISN'T IT?

                         RIGGS
                    (SIGHS)
               YEAH.  SOMETIMES IT REALLY IS.

                         MURTAUGH
               HELL.
                    (BEAT)
               I'M THINKING OF QUITTING.

                         RIGGS
               DON'T  YOU  DARE.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT HIM.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE TOO OLD TO CHANGE NOW,
               COLCHISE.

                         MURTAUGH
               ME?  OLD... ?

                         RIGGS
               YOU JUST HANG IN THERE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  YOU, TOO.

                         RIGGS
               GUESS I'LL SAY GOODBYE.

                         MURTAUGH
               SURE.  COME OVER FOR DINNER
               SOMETIME.

                         RIGGS
               NO, THANKS.

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T BLAME YOU.  I'M THINKING
               OF ARRESTING MY WIFE FOR CRUELTY
               TO BACON.
                    (BEAT)
               MERRY CHRISTMAS, MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               MERRY CHRISTMAS.

     HE WALKS OFF DOWN THE STREET.  MURTAUGH WATCHES HIM GO.
     PAUSE.  TURNS UP HIS COLLAR AGAINST THE CHILL, TAKES A
     FEW STEPS ... AND A MAN STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM.  THE SAME
     PUNK WHO RIGGS BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF AT THE VERY BEGINNING
     OF THE FILM.

                         PUNK
               HEY, OLD MAN, GOT ANY MONEY?

     MURTAUGH STOPS.  STARES.  BLINKS.  AND PROCEEDS TO KICK
     THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.  A KICK.  A PUNCH.  THE PUNK LIES
     ON THE SIDEWALK, SEMI-CONSCIOUS.  MURTAUGH SCOWLS AND
     SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M FIFTY.  THAT'S NOT OLD,
               DICKLESS.

175  EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK (SAME DAY)                            175

     RAIN POURS DOWN. MARTIN RIGGS STANDS OVER A  LONE  GRAVE.
     THERE ARE DARK HOLLOWS UNDER HIS EYES. THE WIND  TUGS  AT
     HIS HAIR.  THE TOMBSTONE READS:

     VICTORIA LYNN RIGGS

     BORN:  1953
     DIED:  1984

     HE REACHES BENEATH HIS OVERCOAT AND REMOVES A BRIGHT
     GREEN CHRISTMAS WREATH, WHICH HE PLACES ATOP THE GRAVE.
     KISSES HIS FINGERTIPS. PRESSES THEM TO THE  MOIST  EARTH.

                         RIGGS
               MERRY CHRISTMAS.
                    (BEAT)
               I LOVE YOU.

     THE RAINS STARTS TO FALL.  RIGGS IS OBLIVIOUS.

176  EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT                                 176

     CARPENTERS ARE AT WORK, PATCHING AND REPAIRING.  THE
     CHRISTMAS LIGHTS STILL SHINE DEFIANTLY. A CAR PULLS  UP.

                                                       CUT TO:

177     FRONT  DOOR                                           177

     AS A HAND KNOCKS SOFTLY:  THE DOOR OPENS -- AND THERE
     STANDS YOUNG RIANNE.  ADORABLE.  SHE LOOKS UP AT THE
     VISITOR... IT IS MARTIN RIGGS.

                         RIANNE
               HI.

                         RIGGS
               HI.

     HE HANDS SOMETHING TO HER.  SHE TAKES IT.  THE BOTTLE OF
     PILLS.  IT HAS A RED RIBBON TIED AROUND IT.

                         RIGGS
               GIVE THAT TO YOUR DAD.  IT'S A
               PRESENT.  TELL HIM I WON'T BE
               NEEDING THEM ANYMORE.

     RIANNE NODS.

                         RIANNE
               OKAY.  YOU WANNA COME IN?  WE'RE
               BUILDING.

     RIGGS THINKS IT OVER.  SHAKES HIS HEAD:

                         RIGGS
               NO, THAT'S OKAY.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS,
               MISSY.

                         RIANNE
               OKAY.

     RIGGS TURNS TO GO.  RIANNE STOPS HIM:

                         RIANNE
               THEY SAY YOU'RE THE BEST.

     BEAT.  HE STOPS.  TURNS AND LOOKS AT HER.

                         RIANNE
               ARE YOU?

                         RIGGS
                    (BIG SMILE; WILD WINK)
               NO ONE CAN TOUCH ME.

     RIANNE BLUSHES.

     RIGGS BEGINS TO WALK AWAY, INTO THE RAIN...

     UNTIL ROGER MURTAUGH APPEARS FROM INSIDE THE BOAT ON THE
     TRAILER HITCH.

     HE STANDS ON DECK AND LOOKS DOWN AT RIGGS.

     RIGGS STOPS.  THEY STAND THERE IN THE RAIN FOR A MOMENT.
     THEN MURTAUGH LOOKS HIM SQUARE IN THE EYE AND SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               SUCKER, IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA CAT
               THE WORLD'S LOUSIEST CHRISTMAS
               TURKEY ALL BY MY LONESOME, YOU'RE
               NUTS.

     RIGGS NODS.  A MOMENT PASSES.  THEN:

                         RIGGS
               I THINK YOUR DAUGHTER KINDA LIKES
               ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU TOUCH HER, I'LL KILL YOU.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'LL TRY.

     HE SMILES.

     MURTAUGH SMILES.

     THE RAIN FALLS, AS THEY ENTER THE HOUSE TOGETHER, AND
     WE

                                                  FADE OUT.

LETHAL WEAPON 2

I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE WAGON. BET'S OFF.

SHUT UP!

WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

IT'S GERMAN.

JAPANESE?

IT'S A JAPANESE RADIO. MAYBE THEY BOUGHT THE L.A.P.D.

THEY OWN EVERYTHING.

SHOTGUN!

SHOTS ARE BEING FIRED.

THANKS FOR THE SCOOP.

THE BASTARD SHOT MY WIFE'S WINDSHIELD.

ENTERING THE PURSUIT.

OH, S***, MAN! WE'RE SPLITTING UP!

SON-OF-A-B***H! NOW WE'RE COOKING.

STEP ON IT!

NO, GO AROUND. I'M DRIVING.

I'LL DRIVE.

NOT ONE SCRATCH, YOU HEAR?

- YOU WON'T MAKE IT. - I WILL.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM!

YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT!

LOOK AT MY SIDE PANEL!

GOD**** IT, YOU WERE RIGHT.

THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM.

HE'S TURNING RIGHT!

GET OUT OF THE WAY!

THIS WAS A NEW CAR, RIGGS.

WELL, IT STILL IS.

NO! WE ALWAYS GO ON "THREE"!

SOMETIMES WE GO, "ONE, TWO, THREE," THEN GO!

GO CHECK BACK THERE!

IF YOU SEE ANYBODY RUNNING OUT, JUST PUMP THE S*** OUT OF THEM.

WHAT WAS THAT?

- HE CRAWLED INTO THE TRUNK. - I GOT YOU COVERED.

HOLY CHRIST!

THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

IT'S GOLD!

GOLD!

KRUGERRANDS.

IT'S ILLEGAL. YOU CAN'T IMPORT THEM INTO THE COUNTRY.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

THE DAMAGE YOU CAUSED IS COMING OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET.

- PAY IT IN KRUGERRANDS. - DON'T MAKE JOKES, MAKE ARRESTS.

I WANT AN EXPLANATION.

- THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND. - YOU SAID THIS WAS A ROUTINE BUST.

YOU DIDN'T MENTION HELICOPTERS, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, KRUGERRANDS...

THIS WAS BIGGER THAN WE THOUGHT.

TALK TO YOU LATER.

I WORKED PSYCHO WARD. YOU'LL NEVER GET OUT.

ONE MINUTE, FIFTEEN SECONDS.

SHAPIRO, SCRATCH MY NOSE.

HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON? IS THIS KINDERGARTEN OR A POLICE STATION?

GET SOME WORK DONE.

HOUDINI JR. BETS HE CAN FREE HIMSELF IN 5 MINUTES.

I WILL TOO.

DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME, KIDS.

IT'S OVER NOW. PUT YOUR MONEY ON THE DESK AND GET BACK TO WORK.

SUCKERS.

HOW THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT?

I DISLOCATED MY SHOULDER ONCE. NOW I CAN DO IT WHENEVER I WANT.

DOESN'T IT HURT?

YEAH, IT DOES.

BUT NOT AS MUCH AS... WHEN I PUT IT BACK IN.

IF IT ISN'T MRS. SIGMUND FRAUD.

MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN, SERGEANT.

WE SHOULD KEEP THIS ON A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL.

WHY THE HELL DO YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF?

WHO ELSE COULD I DO IT TO? NONE OF THEM WILL LET ME.

AND I NEED THE MONEY.

COUGH UP!

IT'S NOT ALL HERE YET. I WANT IT ALL.

WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF TO THIS STUFF! IT'S EVIDENCE. IT'S A KRUGERRAND.

- IT'S MINE. I WON IT. - IT'S NOT YOURS.

YOU WANT TO GET BUSTED?

WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

NOT TONIGHT.

- RIANNE'S COMMERCIAL IS ON. - SHE'S IN A COMMERCIAL?

NOT SO LOUD!

WHAT'S WRONG? I'D BE PROUD IF I WAS YOU.

I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET. WHAT IF SHE STINKS?

YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING. SHE'LL BE GREAT.

LISTEN UP!

TONIGHT AT... WHAT TIME?

COME ON!

WHAT TIME?

EIGHT.

EIGHT O'CLOCK, ON... CHANNEL?

EIGHT. THE SERGEANT'S DAUGHTER, RIANNE. HERE'S A PICTURE OF HER.

SHE'S GOING TO MAKE HER TELEVISION DEBUT IN A COMMERCIAL.

WITH THIS CROWD, BABY, YOU'D BETTER NOT STINK.

WHAT HAPPENED? THIS IS A NEW CAR. MOM'S GOING TO BE UPSET!

- IT'S STILL NEW. - NO, IT'S NOT, IT'S WRECKED.

I DON'T WANT YOUR MOTHER TO KNOW.

DO YOUR HOMEWORK TOO.

- HEY! I HAVEN'T READ THESE. - RIANNE PUT THEM THERE.

WHY DON'T YOU LOOK OUT FOR ME?

HEY, RICKY! I WANT TO USE MY DRIVEWAY ONCE IN A WHILE.

NICE OXYGEN TENT.

- DO I LOOK LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON? - NO, BUT YOU'RE BAD.

THIS IS A TWO-CAR GARAGE, AND THIS IS MY HOBBY ROOM UPSTAIRS.

I RETIRE WHEN I'M 52, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS KICK IN WHEN I'M 55.

YOU'RE NOT RETIRING, ARE YOU?

- I'VE THOUGHT OF IT, SINCE I MET YOU. - THANK YOU.

THIS IS A NICE HOBBY ROOM. ALL YOU NEED NOW IS A HOBBY.

JESUS!

WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

I'M SORRY. THAT'S VERY UNCOOL.

YOU'RE SORRY? CHECK MY SHORTS!

- DON'T YOU USE HAMMERS ANYMORE? - WHAT'S A HAMMER?

EASY. IT'S NO SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

GIVE IT BACK.

A MAN'S NOT EVEN SAFE IN HIS OWN HOME.

THEN STAY THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

YOU GOT ANY TRAFFIC WARRANTS?

CAN YOU FIX THEM?

ALMOST TIME. ARE WE TAPING THIS?

YES, SO WE CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

TAKE THE STAIRS.

NICK, GET YOUR FEET OFF THE TABLE. YOU TOO, MARTIN.

- THE COLOR'S NO GOOD. - IT'S FINE. YOU'LL MESS IT UP.

I WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD.

UNPLUG IT.

THAT'S YOUR SISTER!

PICTURE'S PERFECT.

YEAH?

DO I KNOW YOU?

YES, SIR.

WE HAD A LONG TALK ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

ABOUT WHAT?

YOUR NEW HOBBY ROOM.

THIS IS GEORGE.

DID YOU SENSE THAT I LIKED YOU?

YES, SIR.

SIT DOWN AND BE QUIET.

- WHAT ARE YOU EATING? - MY TUNA FISH SANDWICH.

TUNA?

YOU CAN'T EAT TUNA!

DAD KILLED FLIPPER.

WE'RE BOYCOTTING TUNA...

...BECAUSE THEY KILL THE DOLPHINS THAT GET CAUGHT IN THE NETS.

HAVE HAM.

EAT MISS PIGGY.

- I'M SORRY! - IT'S ONLY MY EYE.

OH, MY GOD! IT'S COMING ON!

MY BABY!

DON'T SHE LOOK GORGEOUS, MARTIN?

WHEN THE TIME HAS COME...

...AND THE MOMENT IS RIGHT...

...REMEMBER...

...USE RAMSES' EXTRA CONDOMS.

- WE DO! - RAMSES' EXTRA.

BECAUSE CARING MEANS ALL THE PROTECTION YOU CAN GET.

TAKE THE KIDS UPSTAIRS.

WE LEARN THIS IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT.

IN HUMAN WHAT?! HUMAN DEVELOPMENT WHAT?!

CHILL OUT, DADDY.

UPSTAIRS!

NICK, UPSTAIRS.

YOU KNOW HOW YOUR FATHER IS.

- I LOOKED FAT. - I LIKED YOU.

HOME. OUT!

I GOT A GUN.

WHAT? SHE LOOKED BEAUTIFUL.

I LIKED IT. SHE MADE ME WANT TO BUY RUBBERS RIGHT NOW.

I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. RIANNE, THAT WAS...

- I THOUGHT YOU WERE TERRIFIC. - REALLY?

I THINK SHE'S GOT A HELL OF A FUTURE.

GEORGE IS AFRAID. HE'S GOING HOME.

STICK AROUND.

HE HAS A GUN.

IT'S AN OLD GUN AND HE'S NOT A VERY GOOD SHOT.

THAT'S GOOD. I'M GOING ANYWAY. GOOD NIGHT.

- I'LL BUY YOU A BEER. - YOU LET HIM BUY IT.

YOU'RE UNDER 21. BE BACK BY MIDNIGHT.

WAIT AND SEE. COPS NEVER LET UP.

I'LL HAVE RUBBERS ON MY DESK, RUBBERS IN THE MAIL, IN THE COFFEE...

IF YOU'D ONLY KEPT YOUR MOUTH SHUT! I'M GOING FOR A WALK.

GIVE THE BOYS SOME CREDIT. IN ONE EAR, OUT THE RUBBER.

HOW GOES IT WITH YOU, HANS?

OKAY. YOU, PIETER?

THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH OF THAT. COME ON OVER HERE, HANS.

MIND THE PLASTIC. I'M HAVING PAINTING DONE.

THE IMPORTANT THING IS...

...ARE YOU OKAY?

NO BONES BROKEN?

I'M FINE, THANKS.

JUST BUMPS AND BRUISES, EH?

YEAH, THAT'S ALL.

GOOD, GOOD.

HOWEVER, WE LOST OVER $1 MILLION IN KRUGERRAND.

I KNOW. I'M SORRY, MR. RUDD.

IT HAPPENS.

IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

SOMETIMES THINGS DO NOT GO AS PLANNED.

AS YOU SAY, THEY JUST HAPPEN, EH, PIETER?

YOU GIVE A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO THE WORD, "DROP CLOTH. "

CERTAIN POLICEMEN HAVE BECOME AN INTOLERABLE NUISANCE.

THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY ON TO US AGAIN. HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO HANDLE IT?

WARN THEM OFF.

IT'S MY EXPERIENCE...

...THAT A SCARED COP IS MORE USEFUL THAN A DEAD ONE.

A WARNING?

IS THAT NOT A BIT TAME?

DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DO IT.

THEN YOU BETTER LOOK AT THIS.

THIS IS THE POLICEMAN IN CHARGE.

A KAFFIR.

LOVELY.

REMEMBER TO TAKE THESE IN ORDER.

THERE'S A PACKET FOR EACH DAY OF THE WEEK.

THIS YOURS?

I FOUND IT IN THE WASH.

I KEEP LOSING THIS.

SOMETHING'S WRONG.

NO, NOT REALLY. IT'S JUST A GOD**** PEN.

WHAT ABOUT THE PEN?

IT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING.

OF WHAT?

IT REMINDS ME OF...

...THE NIGHT VICKI WAS KILLED.

I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUSH.

THAT'S OKAY. WE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS.

I WAS TO MEET HER FOR DINNER. ONE OF THOSE ROMANTIC DINNERS FOR TWO.

I HAD SO MUCH WORK.

AND I FORGOT ABOUT IT.

SHE WAITED AT THE RESTAURANT FOR AN HOUR BEFORE SHE DROVE HOME.

IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN I GOT HOME TO A RINGING PHONE. I ANSWERED IT.

THEY SAID SHE WAS KILLED IN A CAR CRASH.

IF I'D BEEN DRIVING, WE'D HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT.

I REMEMBER FALLING DOWN ON MY KNEES AND SHAKING ALL OVER.

I REMEMBER THINKING, "I'M LOSING IT. "

THERE I WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR...

...AND I'M SEEING UNDER THE COUCH, AND I SEE THIS GOLD PEN.

JUST LYING THERE. I'D BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR TWO MONTHS. THERE IT IS.

SHE WASN'T A GREAT HOUSEKEEPER.

THIS VOICE GOES OFF IN MY HEAD, LIKE A DRILL INSTRUCTOR.

IT SAID, "GET UP! NOW!"

I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT, BUT I GOT UP. MUSCLES WERE STILL WORKING.

THEN I DROVE TO THE HOSPITAL...

...IDENTIFIED HER, SIGNED HER OUT WITH MY GOLD PEN.

TRISH FOUND A GOLD PEN IN THE LAUNDRY.

LOOK AROUND YOU, SAM.

ONE DAY, SAM...

...THIS'LL ALL BE YOURS.

FIND A NICE B***H, RAISE A COUPLE OF PUPS.

A MAN COULD BE HAPPY HERE.

ANYBODY TELL YOU IF YOU SIT ON COLD ROCKS TOO LONG, YOU GET PILES?

LET'S GO WATCH TV.

KAFFIRS!

WONDERING ABOUT YOUR KIDS?

ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE TO THEM?

IF I WAS YOU, I'D BE GOING NUTS NOW.

I'D BE GOING F***ING BANANAS.

WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'VE DONE?

SHALL I TELL YOU?

JUST LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN WILD.

THIS HAS JUST BEEN A WARNING.

AFTER THIS, IT GETS BLOODY. TELL YOUR PEOPLE TO BACK OFF.

DON'T BE A SMART KAFFIR.

MAYBE WE LET YOU LIVE, HUH?

- YOU DIDN'T SEE A FACE? - NOT ONE. THEY HAD ON HOODS.

WHAT ABOUT A VOICE?

THAT CRAZY MOTHERF***ER WHO DID TALK HAD A STRANGE ACCENT.

NOT GERMAN, NOT ENGLISH. KIND OF GUTTURAL. REALLY S****Y ACCENT.

WAIT. ANYTHING LIKE WHAT WE CHASED THE OTHER NIGHT?

YEAH, KIND OF LIKE THAT.

TRISH AND THE KIDS?

THEY'RE AT HER SISTER'S HOUSE IN BELLFLOWER.

LISTEN UP! YOU HEARD WHAT HAPPENED TO ROG LAST NIGHT?

FORENSICS GET BACK WITH ANYTHING?

NOT YET. THEY'LL KEEP US POSTED.

WE GOT TO WATCH EACH OTHER'S BACKS AND FRONTS.

YOU CAN ALL WATCH MY BACK IN POKER TOMORROW. YOU IN?

- IF WE CATCH THESE ASSHOLES. - COUNT ME IN.

I GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOU.

LEO GETZ HAS BEEN PLACED IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY.

YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BABY-SIT UNTIL WASHINGTON SENDS THE FEDS.

- HOW LONG? - UNTIL THE RED TAPE IS PROCESSED.

COUPLE, THREE DAYS.

GETZ IS GOING TO TESTIFY BEFORE A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY.

DRUGS, LAUNDERED MONEY, ETC.

I'LL BE THERE IN 10 MINUTES.

THIS IS NOT A S*** ASSIGNMENT.

- YES, IT IS. - NO, IT ISN'T.

IT ISN'T.

IT IS.

SHUT UP, BOTH OF YOU.

I'VE GUARANTEED HIS SAFETY.

WHY US?

YOU TWO ARE THE MOST QUALIFIED. AND...

...AFTER LAST NIGHT, YOU COULD USE THE BREAK.

I CAN HANDLE LAST NIGHT.

WHAT DO WE DO WITH HIM?

TAKE HIM TO DISNEYLAND.

THIS STINKS. THIS STINKS.

I DON'T GIVE A F***! I DON'T HAVE AN ULCER BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN TO SAY THAT.

HERE'S WHERE HE'S STAYING.

A NICE HOTEL. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS PAYING. ENJOY YOURSELVES.

ONE MORE THING.

KNOW WHAT THAT SAYS?

YEAH. SAME THING AS THAT, BUT I DON'T GIVE A F***.

YOU'RE LUCKY. I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT.

WHAT ROOM IS THAT FOR?

612.

THIS IS IT. 612.

POLICE.

HOW DO I KNOW THAT?

AFTER I SHOOT YOU, YOU CAN EXAMINE THE BULLET. OPEN UP.

DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE A BADGE?

- WHERE'S YOUR BADGE? - SHUT UP.

I GET IT. BAD COP, GOOD COP.

SHUT UP.

BAD COP, BAD COP. I KNOW THE ROUTINES.

- ARE YOU LEO GETZ? - THAT'S ME, LEO GETZ.

WHATEVER YOU NEED, LEO GETS. GET IT?

I USE THAT TO BREAK THE ICE WHEN I MEET PEOPLE.

I'M SGT. MURTAUGH, THIS IS SGT. RIGGS.

NICE TO MEET YOU. SO WHAT DO I CALL YOU GUYS?

SGT. MURTAUGH AND SGT. RIGGS.

WE'RE GOING TO BE YOUR SHADOW.

THAT'S FINE. HEY, AN OLD-FASHIONED...

OKAY. I JUST AIN'T SEEN ONE IN A LONG TIME.

I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE USED THEM ANYMORE.

I BET THE KID'S GOT AN AUTOMATIC. HAVE YOU?

YEP, A BERETTA.

YOU SURE YOU GUYS ARE COPS?

BETTER WATCH HOW YOU TREAT ME. I'M A STATE WITNESS.

STAR WITNESS.

WE'LL TAKE THAT ROOM.

I ALREADY HAVE MY STUFF IN THIS ROOM.

IT'S YOURS, OKAY? I'LL MOVE IT IN THE SMALL ROOM.

I'M THE SMALLEST GUY HERE. I'LL TAKE THE SMALL ROOM.

HEY, LOOSEN UP, GUYS! WE'RE GOING TO BE TOGETHER A LONG TIME.

I'LL GET IT.

IT'S ONLY ROOM SERVICE.

YOU HUNGRY? I'LL CALL FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT.

SEE THIS SILK ROBE? FREE.

- IT'S NOT FREE. - YES, IT IS.

- IT'S TAXPAYERS' MONEY. - SAME THING.

MORNING, GENTLEMEN.

HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

THAT'S MY FOOD. YOU GUYS DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING. BRING IT HERE.

IT'S MINE.

YOU COULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING.

COME ON.

BOY, HEY, YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT.

HEY, I DIDN'T ORDER A HAMBURGER, I ORDERED EGGS.

MARTIN, NOT THE WINDOW! NO!

[ GLASS BREAKS ]

[ ALL SCREAMS ]

S***!

[ SPLASHING ]

[ GUESTS SCREAMS ]

[ WOMAN SCREAMS ]

[ COUGHS ]

[ HITTING ]

SON OF A BITCH! WHERE IS IT?

SOMEBODY STOP THAT GUY! STOP HIM!

DON'T LEAVE ME! I CAN'T SWIM!

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME!

OKAY, OKAY.

COME ON WE'RE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE POOL.

NOW GET THE FUCK OFF MY BACK, OKAY?

CLEAR! MOVE IT! GET BACK! POLICE!

YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?

YEAH, I’M OK. WHERE WERE YOU, MAN? MY PARTNER. WHAT? WHY DIDN'T YOU FOLLOW ME DOWN?

- YEAH, WHY DIDN'T YOU FOLLOW IT DOWN? - SHUT UP, I WAS 7 FLOORS UP!

- HE HIT ME. - GOOD!

THIS GUY TOOK A BIG CHANCE TO POP ALL OF US. WHAT'D YOU WITNESS, A MURDER OR SOMETHING OR WHAT WAS IT?

NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT. HONEST.

ALL I DID WAS LAUNDER A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN DRUG MONEY.

HALF A BILLION DOLLARS?!

MORE OR LESS. WHO CAN COUNT THAT MUCH MONEY?

COULD I HAVE SOME COTTON BALLS FOR MY NOSE?

COULD YOU SHUT THE F*** UP?

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

SHUT UP!

MR. GETZ GOT AWAY. OUR BEST OPPORTUNITY AND HE GETS AWAY.

HE SLIPS THROUGH OUR FINGERS AND INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLICE.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

CHECKING TO SEE IF I WAS STANDING ON PLASTIC.

OKAY, I GOT IT.

I'M WHO I AM. YOU'RE A DRUG DEALER. I WORK IN A BANK.

YOU HAVE MONEY TO LAUNDER. WHAT DO YOU DO?

BRING IT TO YOU.

- HE DOES. - I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY ME?

WHO AM I?

YOU'RE A COURIER. YOU WORK FOR HIM.

I'M THE DRUG DEALER.

DON'T YOU HAVE PLATES? WHAT IS THIS?

I DEPOSIT THE CASH INTO THE ACCOUNT OF A DUMMY FINANCE COMPANY.

I ISSUE YOU A CASHIER'S CHECK...

...IN HIS NAME, MINUS A SMALL COMMISSION FOR MYSELF.

- THE OTHER END. - YOU LIKE BREATHING?

HOW MUCH?

2%.

NOT BAD, LEO. PRETTY PROSPEROUS.

YOU RETURN IT TO ME AS COLLATERAL ON A LOAN I MAKE TO YOU.

BUT YOU DON'T PAY BACK THE LOAN. YOU KEEP THE MONEY.

HOW'S THAT WORK?

THAT'S IT! DON'T YOU GET IT?

IT'S YOUR MONEY. YOU DON'T PAY IT BACK. AND IT'S CLEAN.

IT IS NOW LAUNDERED.

YOU COPS AREN'T TOO BRIGHT.

THIS IS THE BEST PART.

YOU TAKE A TAX DEDUCTION...

...ON INTEREST PAYMENTS YOU DON'T EVEN MAKE.

- AM I A GENIUS? - YOU'RE A SWINDLER.

CHEAT.

COME ON!

EVERYONE CHEATS. LOOK AT THE PENTAGON. SO YOU GOT IT?

SO HOW COME YOU TURNED YOURSELF IN, MR. BIG SHOT?

I WAS SCAMMING THOSE GUYS FOR MONTHS.

EVERY TRANSACTION, I KEPT A LITTLE.

YOU?

IT WAS EASY. CASH DEPOSITS...

...MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SMALL BILLS CHANGING HANDS.

WHO'S GOING TO MISS $10,000 HERE, $20,000 THERE?

DRUG DEALERS.

THAT'S RIGHT. THEY DID.

THAT'S WHY I'M LIVING OUT OF A SUITCASE NOW.

YOU CAN GIVE THAT TO NICK.

BUT IT'S SOFTER. I PUT A FABRIC SOFTENER IN THERE.

IT'S SMALL, LEROY.

IT'S LEO, NOT LEROY. I'LL BUY YOU ANOTHER SHIRT.

JUST GIVE ME THE NAMES OF THOSE DRUG DEALERS.

I DON'T KNOW ANY.

I JUST DEALT WITH THE COURIERS.

WHERE DOES TRISH KEEP MY LAUNDRY?

BEHIND THE MACHINE.

YOU NEVER MET ANYONE EXCEPT COURIERS?

NO NAMES.

WAIT A MINUTE, COME TO THINK OF IT! OKAY, LISTEN.

THEY TOOK ME UP IN THE HILLS TO A HOUSE ON STILTS.

AND I HAD A JOB INTERVIEW WITH A GUY...

...AND HIS NAME WAS...

HAYNES! HANS!

- TAKE US THERE. - WE HAVE TO SIT ON THIS GUY.

IT WON'T HURT TO LOOK.

I KNOW THE ADDRESS.

LET'S GO.

WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS!

COME ON, DON'T BE A KILLJOY!

WE'RE BACK! YOU'RE BLACK, I'M MAD.

THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT!

IF WE'RE GOING, SHOULDN'T I HAVE A GUN?

IS MY NOSE STILL BLEEDING? IT'S REALLY SORE.

SORRY ABOUT THAT.

IT SHOULD BE COMING UP SOON.

- 9856. - THAT'S IT.

- THAT'S ANOTHER POSSIBILITY. - THIS IS THE NINTH POSSIBILITY, LEO.

THAT'S IT. NINE. MY LUCKY NUMBER. NINE.

STAY IN THE CAR.

- CAN'T I COME? - STAY.

NICE CAR.

- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - HOOKING IT UP.

YOU'RE NOT BEING CAREFUL!

I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. IT'S A CAR...

...NOT A BABY CARRIAGE.

YOU'RE CHIPPING THE PAINT.

- YOU SMELL WHAT I SMELL? - I SMELL IT.

A RAT?

A REAL STINKY ONE.

WHERE YOU GOING?

I'M A PEEPING TOM. IT GOES WITH THE BADGE. IT'S FUN SOMETIMES.

BINGO!

LARS, LOOK!

WHAT THE F***?!

WHERE'S THE POOL?

NO POOL.

- OF COURSE THERE IS. - THIS HOUSE IS BUILT ON STILTS.

I'M SURE THERE'S A POOL.

CUFF YOURSELVES.

MOVE THAT TRUCK!

YOUR KEYS!

YOU ALL RIGHT?

WHERE YOU GOING?

THAT WAS THE WAITER FROM THE HOTEL.

WAIT FOR ME!

GET THE F*** OUT OF HERE!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU CAN'T TAKE MY TRUCK!

SERGEANT, IT'S THE GUY FROM THE HOTEL!

WHERE DID HE GO?

RIGGS IS HANGING ON THE TRUCK!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF THE CAR? GET IN THE CAR!

GET BACK! IT'S POLICE BUSINESS!

IT'S A HIGH-SPEED CHASE! GET OUT OF THE WAY!

I LOVE IT! WE GOT TO CATCH HIM!

HELLO, ASSHOLE.

GIVE ME THAT!

THERE THEY ARE! HURRY UP!

CAN'T YOU GO FASTER?!

WILL YOU SHUT THE F*** UP?

WIPE OUT. IT'S UNDER CONTROL.

I TOLD YOU TO LOOK OUT!

- YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR THIS. - SHUT UP! YAK-YAK-YAK.

AND STAY!

WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, A DOG?

HANDS BEHIND YOUR NECK!

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE? WE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

WHAT IS GOING ON?

FREEZE!

GET DOWN HERE!

COME ON, IT'S BEEN A BAD DAY.

SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.

TAKE IT EASY, OFFICER. I'M NOT ARMED.

I WON'T RESIST.

PUT DOWN YOUR GUNS, GENTLEMEN. IT'S ALL RIGHT. DO AS I SAY!

HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.

BEHIND YOUR HEAD!

YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

WE'RE PROFESSIONAL POLICE OFFICERS. WE DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

MY NAME IS ARJEN RUDD.

I'M MINISTER OF DIPLOMATIC AFFAIRS FOR THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSULATE.

SOUTH AFRICA. HOME OF THE KRUGERRAND.

AMONG OTHER THINGS.

THESE MEN ALSO WORK FOR THE CONSULATE.

WE HAVE DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIALS...

KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT OF THERE.

EVERYBODY, TAKE IT EASY. ESPECIALLY YOU, RIGGS.

RIGGS?

YOU'RE MARTIN RIGGS?

FROM CHICAGO. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? WHAT'S HIS NAME?

PIETER VON... VOR...

I'LL JUST CALL YOU ADOLF.

ARE YOU ARJEN RUDD? ARYAN...? THAT'S YOU.

IT'S OFFICIAL.

THEY ARE OFFICIAL.

UNDER THE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ACT...

...NO DIPLOMATIC AGENT MAY BE DETAINED OR ARRESTED...

...ONCE HIS IDENTITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.

WE HAVE A SERIOUS DIPLOMATIC SITUATION HERE...

...WHICH I WILL TAKE UP WITH YOUR STATE DEPARTMENT TOMORROW.

I'M QUAKING IN MY BOOTS, BUT I'LL STILL BRING YOU DOWN.

MY DEAR OFFICER...

...YOU COULD NOT EVEN GIVE ME A PARKING TICKET.

WHO IS THE DICKHEAD NOW, HUH?

THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT OWNS THIS HOUSE. THIS IS SOUTH AFRICAN SOIL.

NOW GET OUT OF HERE.

ALL OF YOU.

DON'T DO IT.

DON'T DO IT OR I'LL MAKE YOU EAT THIS F***ING THING.

KAFFIR.

COULD YOU STEP OUT OF THE CAR, PLEASE?

PUT THEM AWAY. I'M SORRY.

SORRY. ARE YOU OKAY?

DON'T OPEN THAT.

THAT IS A DIPLOMATIC POUCH...

...PROTECTED UNDER ARTICLE 27 OF THE VIENNA CONVENTION.

IS HE SERIOUS WITH THIS STUFF?

THESE ARE POLICE OFFICERS, MISS VAN DEN HAAS. THEY WERE JUST LEAVING.

SHE IS A CONSULATE SECRETARY.

GIVE HER BACK THE BRIEFCASE.

GIVE IT TO HER.

I'M SORRY, MISS CONSULATE SECRETARY.

DON'T TALK TO THEM! COME HERE.

HE'S A NICE GUY. WHAT'S HE PAYING YOU AN HOUR?

WANT TO INCREASE YOUR PAY? BETTER HOURS?

I'D START GETTING USED TO THAT SORT OF VIEW.

IT'S THE TRIANGLE TRADE AGAIN.

DON'T YOU KNOW AMERICAN HISTORY? MOLASSES TO RUM TO SLAVES.

NOW DRUGS TO DOLLARS TO KRUGERRANDS.

I GOT A DEAD GUY WITH A SURFBOARD WHERE HIS FACE USED TO BE...

...AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT BREATHING DOWN OUR THROATS.

I'LL HAVE TO MAKE A FORMAL APOLOGY TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSULATE.

APOLOGIZE? HE'S A SACK OF S***! HE'S A CROOK.

IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE'S A DIPLOMAT.

HE HAS IMMUNITY. WE CAN'T TOUCH HIM, ARREST HIM, PROSECUTE HIM.

- DOES THAT SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU? - YES, SIR.

- WHO THE HELL IS THIS GUY? - LEO GETZ. NICE TO MEET YOU.

YOU TOOK A CIVILIAN ON A BUST. ONE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING!

HE'S ALIVE, ISN'T HE?

I SIGNED A WAIVER. BESIDES, I USUALLY WAIT IN THE CAR.

USUALLY?

THEY'RE VERY ADAMANT ABOUT THAT.

- I DON'T GIVE A F***. - THEY'RE GOOD COPS!

THEY'RE THE BEST. ONE TIME, A GUY WAS WAIVING A GUN...!

WHAT DID HE SAY?

WHAT DID HE SAY?

- "I DON'T GIVE A F***. " - WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

IT'S HIS MANTRA. WHY IS EVERYONE PARKED ON MY DESK? UP!

IT'S A RUBBER PLANT!

IT LOOKS TO BE ABOUT A WEEK'S SUPPLY.

GO SPIT.

I FORGOT. YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR THAT S***.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU CAN EXCHANGE IT.

ONE MOMENT, MISS VAN DEN HAAS.

I HOPE YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAPPENED HERE TODAY.

I'D RATHER NOT JUMP TO ANY WRONG CONCLUSIONS.

WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME?

THE POLICIES OF OUR GOVERNMENT ARE NOT POPULAR HERE IN AMERICA.

THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HERE IS OVERRUN WITH BLACKS.

THEY HAVE BADGES AND GUNS AND THEY HATE US.

OUR CONSULATE, ITS STAFF...

...AND PARTICULARLY MYSELF WILL ALWAYS BE TARGETS FOR THEIR HARASSMENT.

THINGS ARE GETTING OUT OF HAND.

THERE ARE TOO MANY LOSSES. WE'LL MOVE THE CASH IN ONE LARGE SHIPMENT.

WE'LL NEED MORE THAN A SUITCASE.

I'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT. YOU WORRY ABOUT THE POLICE.

YOUR WARNING DID NOT WORK.

- LET'S GO, LEO! - I'M COMING.

COME ON! MOVE!

OKAY! HEY, THEY'RE COPS, OKAY?

I'VE GOT TO EAT, TOO.

GIVE ME THE FOOD.

WHO ORDERED THE SUPER COMBO?

I GET A STEAK SANDWICH.

WHO GETS LEO?

YOU GOT A BIG EMPTY HOUSE. I GOT A TRAILER. WHAT WILL I DO WITH HIM?

MY PLACE IS TOO SMALL. YOU TAKE HIM.

I HAD HIM LAST NIGHT.

EXCUSE ME, FELLOWS.

THIS IS TUNA. I HATE TUNA.

I REFUSE TO GET STUCK WITH TUNA.

- DON'T EAT THE TUNA. - I JUST SAID THAT!

I'M NOT EATING TUNA. LET'S GO BACK.

WE'RE NOT GOING BACK! SHUT UP!

SURE, DON'T GO BACK. OKAY, DON'T GO BACK!

LET ME GIVE YOU A FRIENDLY PIECE OF ADVICE.

NEVER GO THROUGH THE DRIVE-THROUGH. ALWAYS WALK UP TO THE COUNTER.

LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

THEY F*** YOU AT THE DRIVE-THROUGH!

THEY KNOW YOU'LL BE MILES AWAY BEFORE YOU FIND OUT YOU GOT F***ED.

YOU WON'T TURN AROUND AND COME BACK.

SO WHO GETS F***ED? LEO GETZ.

I'M NOT EATING THIS TUNA!

SHUT UP!

GET RID OF THAT MAN.

YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE THE PREMISES RIGHT NOW.

THE MORNING FAXES.

WHAT'S THE MATTER? HE KICK YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE?

I WANT YOU TO BITE LEO FOR ME.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I'M CLEANING UP THIS PIGSTY.

I LIKE THIS PIGSTY.

WHEN DID YOU LAST DO THE REFRIGERATOR? OR THE PAN UNDER IT?

THERE'S A PAN UNDER THERE?

WHERE'S MY PHONE?

WHERE'S MY TV? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

EVERYTHING IS OUTSIDE.

JUST STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

- GET THE DOG OUT OF HERE! - YOU GO BEFORE THE MUTT.

OUT, OUT! OH, MAN.

IT'S COLLINS.

HAS MURTAUGH CHECKED IN WITH YOU?

NO. WHY?

I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM. HE DOESN'T ANSWER HIS PHONE.

I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

STAY IN THE CAR.

I'M UPSTAIRS!

SHOULD I CALL 999, OFFICER IN DISTRESS?

I'LL COVER THE BACK!

- WHERE ARE YOU? - I'M UP HERE.

IN HERE.

GOOD MORNING.

FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS...

...I GET THE BATHROOM TO MYSELF.

NO KIDS BANGING ON THE DOOR. NO WIFE ASKING ME TO HURRY UP.

JUST ME AND MY NEW SALTWATER SPORTSMAN MAGAZINE!

THE ONE WITH THE ARTICLE ON DEEP-SEA FISHING?

SO I'M READING ABOUT MARLIN FISHING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO...

...WHEN I GLANCED OVER.

OH, JESUS.

IS THAT ALL?

YOU SCARED THE S*** OUT OF ME.

SCARED THE S*** OUT OF YOU?

HOW LONG YOU BEEN HERE?

I'VE BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT.

MY LEGS ARE SO NUMB I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN...

DON'T MOVE.

I CAN'T.

JUST STAY THAT WAY. DO YOU MIND?

IT'S A DIRTY JOB, BUT SOMEONE'S GOT TO DO IT.

TELL ME I'M NOT F***ED.

HE'S F***ED.

OKAY, BUT I'D BE LYING.

YOU'LL BE OKAY IF YOU DON'T STAND UP.

THAT'S A RELIEF.

- I HAVE TO GET HELP. - NO WAY!

WHY?

I'M ON THE TOILET. GIVE ME A BREAK.

THIS IS SERIOUS. I GOT TO GET THE BOMB SQUAD HERE.

BOMB SQUAD?

OKAY, CALL THEM IN.

DON'T USE THE OPEN FREQUENCY.

LET'S TRY TO KEEP THIS QUIET, OKAY?

SURE. TRUST ME.

AN ESCORT IS REALLY NOT NECESSARY.

I KNOW YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST, BUT IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT.

I HAVE HELPED POLICEMEN THROUGH VERY TRAUMATIC MOMENTS.

THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS ROOM THAT I CANNOT HANDLE.

I WAS WRONG.

EXCUSE ME.

I SHOULD'VE KNOWN, WHERE THERE'S ONE, THERE'S THE OTHER.

YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST? I HAVE THESE DREAMS.

IT'S READY TO COME OUT.

I GOT TO LIVE IN THIS HOUSE!

CLEAR THIS ROOM.

COME ON, RIGGS.

YOU, TOO, RIGGS.

NO.

RIGGS, OUT.

ALL RIGHT.

DIVE INTO THE TUB.

THEN PULL THE BOMB BLANKET OVER YOUR HEAD.

THIS CAST IRON TUB WILL WITHSTAND A HELL OF A BLAST.

I CAN'T.

HE CAN'T. HE'S BEEN ON THERE FOR 18 HOURS.

HE CAN'T EVEN WALK.

I'M GONNA HAVE TO HELP HIM.

ALL RIGHT, YOU BETTER WEAR THIS.

THE NITROGEN?

ALMOST THERE.

HE'S SPRAYING THIS THING WITH LIQUID NITROGEN...

...TO GIVE YOU 1 OR 2 SECONDS BEFORE DETONATION.

- GOT THAT? - 2 SECONDS. THANKS A LOT.

LIGHTS OUT.

GET HIM UP AND OUT.

GOOD LUCK.

YOU GOT A PIECE?

- YEAH, A SMITH AND WESSON. - TRY THIS ONE.

SAFETY'S ON. I'LL COLLECT IT LATER.

GOOD LUCK.

ALONE AT LAST.

WHY DIDN'T THEY PLANT THE BOMB IN TRISH'S STOVE?

ALL THE NEEDLESS SUFFERING COULD HAVE ENDED THERE.

I'M GOING TO DIE ON A TOILET.

GUYS LIKE YOU DON'T DIE ON TOILETS.

AND I'M HERE AND I DON'T PLAN ON GOING NOW.

LET'S DO IT.

ON THREE. WAIT, LET ME GET INTO THE TUB.

I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU...

ON THREE, HUH? WHAT DO YOU SAY?

ONE...

...TWO...

WAIT.

DO WE DO IT ON THREE, OR...

...ONE, TWO, THREE...

- ... THEN DO IT? - IT'S YOUR ASS. IT'S UP TO YOU.

MY ASS, YEAH.

THREE.

WE GO ON THREE?

ONE, TWO AND THEN THREE!

ONE...

MARTIN?

I KNOW.

I MEAN IT, MAN.

I HEAR YOU.

WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIE, ALL RIGHT?

ON THREE.

GET OFF ME. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO SEE US LIKE THIS.

MR. JONES?

SIT DOWN.

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY?

I HAVE THIS PROBLEM, THIS VERY DELICATE MATTER.

MY FRIEND WANTS TO EMIGRATE TO SOUTH AFRICA.

OF COURSE, I CAN HELP HIM DO THAT.

I WANT YOU TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

TALK HIM OUT OF IT?

WHATEVER FOR?

THIS IS A BAD TIME FOR HIM TO GO, WITH ALL THE TROUBLE.

HAVE HIM COME BACK LATER IN THE WEEK AND WE'LL SIT DOWN...

HE'S HERE.

YEAH, HE'S HERE NOW. ALPHONSE?

THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE.

SAY, WHAT?

LISTEN TO YOUR FRIEND. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO GO TO SOUTH AFRICA.

WHY NOT?

BECAUSE YOU'RE BLACK.

YOU ARE.

HE IS.

OF COURSE I AM BLACK. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GO.

TO JOIN MY BROTHERS IN THE STRUGGLE...

...AGAINST THE RACIST...

...FASCIST...

...WHITE MINORITY REGIME!

FASCIST REGIME!

ONE MAN, ONE VOTE!

FREE SOUTH AFRICA, YOU SON-OF-A-B***H!

I'VE HEARD AS MUCH AS I WANT TO. YOU MUST LEAVE.

WHAT'S HAPPENING? DON'T TOUCH ME! BACK OFF!

CLOSE THE SECURITY GATE! QUICKLY!

END APARTHEID NOW!

YOU GOING TO ARREST ME IF I DON'T SHUT UP?

ONE MAN, ONE VOTE! FREE SOUTH AFRICA! GIVE ME THAT FLAG!

YOU CAN'T PUSH ME OUT!

YOU CALL THIS SECURITY?

MORE PEOPLE COME IN AND OUT OF HERE THAN GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

WAIT, GENTLEMEN!

DON'T BOTHER TO CALL THE POLICE. I'M HERE ALREADY.

I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

WELL, WELL.

THE MASTER RACE.

I HOPE YOU REALIZE THE TROUBLE YOU ARE IN RIGHT NOW.

AS USUAL, YOU PEOPLE HAVE EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN AND TURNED AROUND.

GENTLEMEN...

...SHOW OFFICER RIGGS INTO THE STREET.

FINGERS OFF.

HANDS OFF!

LET ME SEE THAT.

THAT'S A PIECE OF HARDWARE YOU GOT. WHERE DO YOU GET THAT STUFF?

I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. WHERE'S IT FROM, SOUTH AFRICA?

DON'T MOVE.

YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT ME? I GOT A BAD REPUTATION. SOMETIMES I GO NUTS.

DON'T MOVE.

I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU, ARJEN. OR IS IT ARYAN?

WHATEVER THE F*** YOUR NAME IS.

YOU FOLD UP YOUR TENTS...

...AND GET OUT OF MY COUNTRY...

...AND I WON'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU.

I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

'CAUSE IF YOU STICK AROUND HERE, I'M GONNA F*** YOUR ASS.

SEND YOU HOME WITH YOUR BALLS IN A SLING.

JUST GET OUT OF HERE...

...KAFFIR LOVER.

EENIE...

...MEENIE...

...MINEY...

HEY, MOE!

SORRY, ADOLF.

PICK THEM UP WITH YOUR HANDS.

BIG SMILE. BIG SMILE!

VORSTEDT, COME HERE.

VORSTEDT!

- HELLO, OFFICER...? - MARTIN RIGGS.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I'VE BEEN WITH YOUR BOSS... SHOOTING THE BREEZE.

SHOOTING HIS FISH.

THE GUY GOES, "BUT, BUT, BUT... YOU'RE BLACK!"

HE'S BLACK.

NO S***.

HE STARTED SOME S***!

YOU GET INTO RUDD'S OFFICE?

I GOT UP THERE.

ARYAN CRUD AND HIS BROWN SHIRTS TURNED UP, BUT I RIPPED THIS OFF A PAD.

"ALBA VARDEN, THURSDAY. " ALBA VARDEN?

ISN'T THAT HITLER'S GIRLFRIEND?

THAT'S EVA BRAUN.

HE HAS A DATE WITH HER THURSDAY.

HER NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

I DON'T KNOW HER. IT JUST SOUNDS FAMILIAR. ALBA VARDEN.

A DELI! LET'S EAT. I'M STARVING.

I'LL SPRING.

LET'S GO. SOUNDS GOOD.

- GET OUT THE OTHER SIDE, LEO. - IT'S OKAY!

NO CARS.

THAT POLICEMAN.

YOU SHOULD PICK FROM THE BOTTOM.

THEY PUT THE OLD STUFF ON TOP.

OFFICER RIGGS!

I FOLLOWED YOU FROM THE CONSULATE.

YOU FOLLOWED ME?

WELL, I NEEDED SOME PORK CHOPS AND A TOILET BRUSH, TOO.

I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE...

...FOR THE OTHER DAY, IF WE FRIGHTENED YOU.

I WAS A BIT STARTLED BY ALL THOSE GUNS.

I'M SORRY. AND I WANTED TO THANK YOU, TOO.

THANK ME FOR WHAT?

YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR BOSS VERY MUCH, DO YOU?

I DON'T LIKE MANY THINGS ABOUT MY BOSS AND MY COUNTRY.

BUT I LIKE MY JOB VERY MUCH.

IT KEEPS ME HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

YOU LIKE THIS TOWN?

THAT'S A NEW ONE.

- I FORGOT YOUR FIRST NAME. - IT'S RIKA.

RIKA VAN HAAGEN-DAZS.

- ICE CREAM? - NO, VAN DEN HAAS. IT'S DUTCH.

THAT'S REAL PRETTY.

YOU GOT A RABBIT AT HOME?

IT'S MINE.

SHOP ONE DAY AT A TIME?

GOOD POLICE WORK, OFFICER.

I GET PAID FOR THAT.

I DON'T SHOP FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK.

WHY NOT?

I NEVER KNOW WHAT I'LL BE HUNGRY FOR.

WAIT. HAVE DINNER WITH ME.

I GOT A NICE PLACE ON THE BEACH. A GOOD VIEW FROM EVERY WINDOW.

A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET. COME ON, BE ORIGINAL. EVERYONE ELSE SAYS NO.

COME TO MY PLACE. I'M A GOURMET COOK.

LET GO OF THE BASKET.

I'LL SCREAM.

I'LL EMBARRASS YOU IN PUBLIC. YOU'LL TURN RED LIKE THAT APPLE.

- COME ON WITH ME. - NO, NO, PLEASE.

LET GO OF MY BAG! LOOK WHAT SHE'S DOING! SOMEBODY CALL A COP!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

LET'S GO BEFORE SOMEONE CALLS A COP.

YOU ARE A COP.

YOU MUST BE AN HONEST COP.

IT AIN'T MUCH, BUT IT'S EVERYTHING I SAID. LOOK AT THE VIEW.

I DID EXAGGERATE ABOUT ONE THING, THOUGH.

I'M NOT EXACTLY A GOURMET COOK. I CAN ONLY MAKE CHILI.

- LIKE IT WITH CRUSHED OREOS? - OF COURSE.

A WOMAN AFTER MY OWN HEART.

WATCH YOUR STEP.

SAM WANTS IN.

HERE, SIT DOWN. OH, WAIT A MINUTE. A LITTLE FILTHY.

I HAVE NO WINE. HOW ABOUT A BEER?

THAT'S FINE.

SHE DRINKS BEER.

WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU GOT A DIRTY GLASS?

OH, IT'S THE WEDDING RING.

I USED TO BE MARRIED.

NOT ANY MORE?

NOT ANY MORE.

I'VE GOT SOMETHING ON THE STOVE.

RUDD'S HIDING BEHIND HIS DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIALS, ISN'T HE?

RUDD'S HIDING BEHIND HIS DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIALS.

HE'S NOT A VERY NICE GUY.

WHATEVER HE'S DOING...

...HE SHOULDN'T GET AWAY WITH IT.

HOW'S IT HANGING, WYLER?

- WHAT DO YOU WANT? - I HOPE BETTER THAN MURTAUGH.

EASY, EASY.

TELL ME SOMETHING. HAVE YOUR BRAINS EVER SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY?

WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT? I'M A COP!

NO, YOU WERE A COP.

HURRY UP, HONEY.

I'M GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE LAPS BEFORE I GO TO THE STATION.

SAM, TAKE A HIKE. NO STOOGES TONIGHT. GO ON.

GET THAT BEER IN HERE.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

CAVANAUGH, ARE YOU IN OR OUT?

I'M OUT.

PUT SOME MUSIC ON.

WHO'S NOT ACCOUNTED FOR?

RIGGS AND MURTAUGH.

MURTAUGH'S TAKING THE WITNESS TO A NEW LOCATION.

- AND RIGGS? - HASN'T CHECKED IN YET.

GET ON THE RADIO AND FIND THEM!

WE LOST WYLER, COLLINS, CAVANAUGH. HOW MANY DO WE HAVE TO LOSE?

LET'S WORRY ABOUT THE ONES THAT ARE ALIVE, ALL RIGHT? DO IT.

SORRY, CAPTAIN.

GET ME RIGGS.

I'LL GET THAT.

WRONG NUMBER.

THANKS TO YOU, I MISSED MY POKER GAME AND I WAS FEELING REAL LUCKY.

OKAY, SO WHAT I SEE ARE NICE, CONSERVATIVE TAX RETURNS.

EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK, BLACK AND WHITE.

SO YOU JUST NEED TO PLAY AROUND IN THE GRAY AREAS...

...IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME BUCKS.

ON YOUR SALARY, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO BUT YOU NEED DEDUCTIONS.

- MY BOAT. - YOU CAN'T DEDUCT IT.

NO, IT'S THE BILL OF SALE.

I KNOW, BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT.

THAT'S IT, MY BOAT! LET'S GO!

TO MY HOUSE.

BECAUSE OF MY BOAT.

LOOK AT THIS COMMERCIAL.

LOOK AT THE BODY ON THIS KID. SHE IS SO HOT.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I WANT TO LOOK AT THE GIRL! WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

I DIDN'T HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

SAY WHAT? SHE'S GREAT.

SHE MAKES ME WANT TO BUY RUBBERS.

TIME FOR THE SEVENTH INNING STRETCH.

THAT'S A BASEBALL EXPRESSION.

I KNOW.

BUT WE'RE ONLY UP TO THE FOURTH INNING.

BATTER UP.

STAY IN THE CAR.

I'LL ONLY BE A MINUTE, OKAY?

STAY IN THE CAR? IT'S COLD. YOU HAVE NO DOOR.

YOU'RE THE REASON THERE'S NO DOOR. TURN ON THE HEAT.

DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING. NOTHING. I MEAN NOTHING!

ALBA VARDEN. WHY DO I KNOW THE NAME?

IT'S HERE. IT'S GOT TO BE.

- ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER HOBBY. - YEAH, ANOTHER HOBBY. WHAT'S NEW?

THAT'S THE DAY ON MY BOAT.

IT'S NOT THERE. WHERE IS IT?

MY BIRTHDAY.

I'LL BE DAMNED.

ALBA VARDEN IS A SHIP, NOT A WOMAN.

LEO, I TOLD YOU TO STAY IN THE CAR!

S***!

NAILED THEM BOTH.

MY CAR!

LEO!

GET UP, GET DRESSED. GET DRESSED. COME ON.

- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. - JUST TRUST ME. I GOT A BAD FEELING.

GET IN THE TRUCK. THE KEYS ARE UNDER THE FRONT SEAT.

WHEN THEY STOP TO RELOAD, RUN FOR THE TRUCK!

- WHAT ABOUT YOU? - I'LL BE OKAY.

I'LL MEET YOU IN THE TRUCK. GO ON! STAY OUT OF THE LIGHT!

THE MASTER RACE.

YOU S***! WHO WERE THOSE PEOPLE?

YOU TELL ME. WAS IT YOUR HUSBAND? WHAT ARE YOU DOING SATURDAY?

IT'S SAM!

HEAD DOWN!

COME ON, SAM!

COME ON, SAM.

SHAKE A LEG.

YOU MADE IT.

HAS HE GOT ANY HOLES IN HIM?

OH, YOU CLEVER DOG.

I PROMISED TO HAVE YOU HOME BY 11.

THIS IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE FIRST DATE I'VE EVER BEEN ON.

WAIT UNTIL THE SECOND ONE.

- NO MORE HELICOPTERS, PLEASE. - OKAY, I PROMISE.

THIS IS A VERY NICE BUILDING.

ANY VACANCIES? I'M BETWEEN HOMES.

YOU CAN STAY RIGHT HERE.

I CAN?

YES, THERE'S A VACANT APARTMENT UP THERE.

I'M KIDDING.

YOU CAN STAY WITH ME.

TONIGHT?

YES, TONIGHT. AND TOMORROW NIGHT. AND THE NIGHT AFTER THAT.

AND AFTER THAT?

DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK.

I BETTER GO.

GO INSIDE AND LOCK ALL THE DOORS AND STAY THERE.

AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WORK TOMORROW.

THERE'S BETTER WAYS OF STAYING IN LA THAN WORKING THERE.

ALL RIGHT. I'VE JUST QUIT.

I'LL JUST GRAB A FEW THINGS... HELL, I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING.

JUST BRING YOURSELF.

I BETTER GO.

GO HOME!

GO GET THE GIRL.

I WOULD OFFER YOU A DRINK, BUT I UNDERSTAND...

...YOU'RE ON THE WAGON.

THAT STUFF WILL KILL YOU QUICK.

YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT ME, WHO ARE YOU?

I CHANGED THE COURSE OF YOUR LIFE.

FOUR YEARS AGO...

...WHEN YOU WAS A NARC AT LONG BEACH...

...YOU WERE GETTING TOO CLOSE, SO WE PUT A CONTRACT OUT ON YOU.

I HANDLED IT MYSELF.

DROVE YOUR CAR RIGHT OFF THE ROAD, REMEMBER?

BUT YOU WEREN'T DRIVING, WERE YOU?

YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THE SURPRISE...

...WHEN I PULLED BACK A MATTED MOP OF BLOODY HAIR TO SEE THIS WOMAN'S FACE.

YOUR WIFE, RIGHT?

SHE DIDN'T DIE STRAIGHT AWAY.

IT TOOK A BIT OF TIME.

YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH LUCK WITH WOMEN, DO YOU?

SHE'S DEAD. THEY KILLED HER.

WHERE ARE YOU?

THEY KILLED HER. SHE'S DEAD. THEY KILLED THEM BOTH.

SLOW DOWN. WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHERE ARE YOU?

SHE'S DEAD, ROGER.

CALM DOWN. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. WHERE ARE YOU?

I'M NOT A COP TONIGHT. IT'S PERSONAL.

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT. THERE'S MORE.

I'M GOING TO GET THOSE BASTARDS. I'M GOING TO F*** THEM. I'M GOING NOW.

WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE STILT HOUSE! WE'RE UNDER ORDERS!

THEN THE HOUSE WILL HAVE TO COME TO ME.

THEY KILLED THEM BOTH.

THEY GOT RIKA AND THEY GOT MY WIFE.

S***.

WHAT'S THE DEAL?

YOU TALK TO THE FEDS, BUT YOU DON'T TALK TO ME.

THAT'S NOT FAIR.

WE TRUSTED YOU.

YOU BETRAYED US.

YOU TOOK OUR MONEY!

WE WANT IT BACK NOW...

...YOU SLIMY LITTLE S***.

GIVE HIM MORE. HE LIKES IT.

DON'T TRY AND STOP ME.

I'VE SEEN THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYES BEFORE.

THEY DECLARED WAR ON THE POLICE.

YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

I HEARD IT ON THE RADIO.

WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY.

CAVANAUGH...

...WYLER, SHAPIRO...

...RIKA, VICKI. HOW MUCH F***ING AUTHORITY DO YOU NEED?

YOU GOT A PLAN?

DRIVE AROUND THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE...

...WAIT FOR MY SIGNAL...

...AND THEN JUST GO IN AND SHOOT THOSE F***ERS.

THEY GOT LEO.

BE CAREFUL.

WAIT.

WHAT'S YOUR SIGNAL?

YOU'LL KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS.

SOMEHOW I THINK I WILL KNOW.

FEEL LIKE TALKING?

IT'S THE BIG ONE!

COOL IT. WATCH HIM.

MOVE ME AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS!

RIGGS, YOU CRAZY MOTHER...!

HOLY CHRIST!

- YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH, I'M OKAY.

THANKS.

- WAS ADOLF IN THERE? - HE GOT AWAY.

- I'M GOING TO FIND HIM. - WHAT ABOUT LEO?

WHAT ABOUT LEO?

YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

TAKE MY CAR TO THE POLICE STATION AND WAIT FOR THE FEDERAL MARSHAL.

IT'S BEEN AN EXPERIENCE KNOWING YOU.

- I DON'T WANT A HUG. - GO ON. LUCKY IF YOU SEE HIM AGAIN.

I HAD A LOT OF FUN.

YOU DO YOUR DUTY NOW.

I'M GOING TO REALLY GET THEM NOW.

LISTEN. WAIT.

IS IT OKAY IF I SOUND THE SIREN?

LOUD AS YOU WANT.

REALLY? OKAY. REALLY?

CHECK IT OUT.

ALBA VARDEN IS A CARGO SHIP, NOT A WOMAN.

THE PORT AUTHORITY SAID THAT THE ALBA VARDEN ARRIVED TODAY...

...AND HEADS OUT TOMORROW TO SOUTH AFRICA.

THIS IS THE ELEVENTH DOCK.

IT MUST BE HERE SOMEPLACE. I KNOW I'M RIGHT.

THE SHIP!

WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

THAT CONTAINER THERE WITH THREE HEAVY HITTERS.

LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

I'LL TAKE 2 OF THEM OUT, YOU TAKE 1.

BETTER YET, YOU TAKE 2, I TAKE 1. PULL OVER TO THE SIDE.

- I CAN'T SEE S***! - ME, EITHER. WHAT IS THIS S***?

GOT A LIGHT?

IT'S RUDD'S, WHATEVER IT IS.

I STILL CAN'T SEE S***.

- YOU GOT SOMETHING? - I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A CAR.

S***! FORT KNOX!

HELL, HOW MUCH IS IT?

THOUSANDS.

F***ING MILLIONS.

BILLIONS OF F***ING DONALD TRUMP LOTTO.

LOOK AT THIS.

THESE ARE $1,000 BILLS!

WITH WHAT I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND I COULD PUT ALL MY KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE.

TAKE IT.

F**ING DRUG MONEY.

DO SOMETHING GOOD WITH IT.

RUDD WON'T NEED IT WHERE HE'S GOING.

LOAD THE CONTAINER.

THE NEXT TIME THE SUN HITS THEIR BODIES, THEY'LL BE IN CAPE TOWN.

- HEY, THIS THING'S MOVING. - IT SURE AS HELL IS.

- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW? - I DON'T KNOW.

LET'S SHOOT OUR WAY OUT.

NO, DON'T. I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

OUR MONEY.

MAKE SURE THEY'RE DEAD.

- YOU GO FIRST. I'M TOO OLD. - YOU GO FIRST. I'LL COVER YOU.

- HOW DO WE GET OUT OF HERE? - I'LL GO THIS WAY.

I'LL GO THIS WAY AND CHECK OVER HERE.

OH, S***!

RIGGS, YOU OKAY?

DROP IT, ASSHOLE!

DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!

IT'S JUST BEEN REVOKED.

YOU'RE BREATHING. YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

NO, DON'T DIE.

YOU'RE NOT DEAD UNTIL I TELL YOU.

YOU GOT THAT, RIGGS? YOU'RE NOT DEAD UNTIL I TELL YOU.

YOU GOT THAT?

YOU' RE NOT DEAD UNTIL I TELL YOU.

NOW, BREATHE WITH ME.

BREATHE.

ROG, IN MY POCKET.

I WANT YOU TO THROW THOSE THINGS AWAY. THOSE THINGS WILL KILL YOU.

YOU SON-OF-A-B***H.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE DYING.

I DIDN'T DIE ON YOUR TOILET, I'M NOT GOING TO DIE IN YOUR ARMS.

YOU SON-OF-A-B***H.

WHERE ARE THEY? ARE THEY ALL GONE? DID YOU GET THE BAD GUYS?

THEY BEEN DEKAFFIRNATED.

DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH! JESUS!

DID ANYONE EVER TELL YOU...

...YOU REALLY ARE A BEAUTIFUL MAN?

GIVE US A KISS.

WHERE'D THAT BULLET HIT YOU?

YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHY AM I DOING THIS? WHY?
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

- WAIT!
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I THINK.
- YOU THINK MAYBE THE RED?
NO! NO!
I'M THINKING IT'S 8 MINUTES AND 42 SECONDS.
WE CAN GO UPSTAIRS, WAIT FOR
THE BOMB SQUAD, AND HAVE A CAPPUCCINO.
THE BOMB SQUAD NEVER GETS HERE ON TIME.
AND IT'S 8 MINUTES, 31 SECONDS.
ROG, PLEASE.
FORGET THE CAPPUCCINO.

THE BLUE WIRE," WHICH I'LL DO RIGHT NOW.
- WAIT, WAIT!
- WHAT?
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?
IT'S JUST A HUNCH.
A HUNCH?
REMEMBER THE BOMB UNDER YOUR TOILET?

YOU'LL NEVER SELL THE HOUSE.
OKAY, OKAY. WE SAW ENOUGH
OF THE KITCHEN.
LEO: I'LL SHOW YOU THE UPSTAIRS. WAIT TILL
YOU SEE IT. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. YOU'LL LOVE IT.
[TIRES SCREECH]
ROGER: THEY'RE GONE. LEO GETZ,
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM!
SON OF A BITCH! I'M GOING TO KILL HIM!
YOU HAVE TO LET ME, RIGGS!
THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BUY IT ANYWAY!
- YOU SCARED THEM AWAY!
- THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO BUY IT!
- OH, I SEE.
- OKAY, RELAX.
I HAD TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING.
IT'S THE LAW. "FULL DISCLOSURE."
LEO: YOU MUST HAVE HEARD OF IT?
ROGER: I'M A COP! I'M THE LAW!
RIGGS: GET OFF ME! WHAT IS IT WITH YOU?
LEO: HOLD IT!
OKAY, OKAY.
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T TELL THEM
ABOUT THE NAIL-GUN INCIDENT.
I FORGOT. DID YOU HAVE A PERMIT
WHEN YOU BUILT OVER THE GARAGE?
PERMIT?
HOLD IT! LEO'S HERE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS.
WE'LL GET SOME BACK-DATED PERMITS.
LEO: WHICH PHONE CAN I USE?
ROGER: SUNROOM.
ROGER: IT MUST BE EASIER THAN THIS.
LEO: COUNT ON LEO GETZ.
YOU NEED LESS AGGRAVATION.
COME TO WORK WITH ME.
THANK YOU, LEO! SON OF A BITCH!
STOP FRONTING YOURSELF. YOU KNOW?
SWING WITH ME AND MY CREW.
[RAP MUSIC PLAYING IN CAR]
DARRYL: FORGET SCHOOL.
HERE COMES YOUR POPS.
NICK: LATER.
DARRYL: ALL RIGHT, GOTCHA.
NICK: NEXT TIME.
NEIGHBOR: 'MORNING, ROG.
ROGER: HOW'RE YOU DOING?
HEY, NICK.
- WASN'T THAT DARRYL?
- YEAH.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND IN A WHILE.
HE DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.
THOSE ARE PRETTY GANG COLORS HE'S WEARING.
YEAH, I KNOW.
HEY, NICK?
YEAH, DAD?
BE GOOD.
WORD.
"WORD," NICK.
WORD.
"WORD," RIGGS.
"WORD," ROG.
ROGER: WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
RIGGS: "WORD."
FOUR LETTERS. STARTS WITH A "W",
"O" IN THE MIDDLE, "D" AT THE END.
ROGER: OH, YEAH, THAT WORD.
ROGER: "WORD."
JACK: TYRONE, MY MAN, HOW ARE YOU?
TYRONE: JACK, HOW'S IT GOING?
JACK: LET'S TAKE A WALK.
TYRONE: WAIT HERE FOR ME.
JACK: LOOK AROUND. THIS IS MY DREAM
AND IT'S ALL COMING TRUE.
TYRONE: YOU SANK YOUR MONEY INTO THIS,
OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT?
JACK: KNOW WHY IT'LL BE A GOLD MINE?
TYRONE: DO TELL.
BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO LIVE
NEXT DOOR TO A MENACE LIKE YOU.
I CAME TO DO BUSINESS,
NOT TO BE INSULTED BY YOU.
RELAX, TYRONE.
LIKE HOUSES, FRIENDSHIPS NEED
STRONG FOUNDATIONS.
SMITTY, COME HERE. COME HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
DON'T I PAY YOU GOOD AND TAKE CARE OF YOU?
- SURE YOU DO.
- WHAT ABOUT THE STUNT YOU AND BILLY PULLED?
IT WAS A GOOD PLAN. IT WORKED.
IT WORKED? IT DIDN'T WORK.
YOU GOT NAILED, FIRST TIME OUT.
NOBODY WHO WORKS FOR ME
GOES INTO BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
SEE HOW THAT CAN JEOPARDIZE EVERYTHING?
RIGHT, TYRONE?
TYRONE: WHATEVER.
JACK: ESPECIALLY TRYING TO POP
AN ARMORED CAR.
JACK: OKAY, BILLY GOT CAUGHT.
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THAT NOW.
HE'LL HAVE TO FACE THE MUSIC ON HIS OWN.
BUT YOU AND ME...
...WE'RE GONNA START OVER.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
SMITTY: WHATEVER YOU SAY, JACK.
JACK: GOOD.
GLAD YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[SMITTY GROANS]
[CEMENT GURGLING]
NOW WE'VE GOT A RELATIONSHIP
WE CAN BUILD ON.
- EMPLOYEE PROBLEMS. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS?
- YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU INVEST TIME AND ENERGY
INTO TRAINING SOMEBODY.
THEN, THEY GET GREEDY AND DO SOMETHING
STUPID THAT JEOPARDIZES EVERYTHING.
IT'S A BITCH!
STICK AROUND. THIS IS THE GOOD PART.
WE CAN PUT OUR INITIALS IN THERE, YEAH?
TYRONE: JESUS CHRIST!
[CACKLES]
RIGGS: LANKERSHIM AND VINELAND.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
ROGER: RIGHT HERE. RIANNE'S GOT A
NEW JOB. I PROMISED HER I'D STOP BY.
RIGGS: THAT'S A GOOD REASON.
ROGER: ALL RIGHT. HERE WE ARE.
ROGER: YOU GOT ANY SILVER, ANY CHANGE?
RIGGS: WE'RE COPS.
THAT'S RIGHT, WE'RE COPS. NOT CROOKS.
I'LL GET CHANGE.
MAN: GET DOWN! ALL OF YOU!
GET DOWN!
RIGGS! RIGGS!
[RIANNE SCREAMS]
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH A RUBBER GUN?
THIS IS A FILM!
CUT, CUT, CUT! WHO THE FUCK IS THIS LUNATIC?
DIRECTOR: GET HIM OFF MY SET.
ACTOR: THIS ISN'T PART OF THE STORY.
DIRECTOR: CAN WE GET A COP?
RIANNE, I'M SO SORRY.
I FEEL LIKE A MICROBE RIGHT NOW.
YOU REALLY THOUGHT I WAS IN TROUBLE?
RIGGS: I DID.
A REAL COP! GO SIT IN YOUR FUCKING TRAILER!
DIRECTOR: ARE YOU A FUCKING IDIOT?
RIGGS: I APOLOGIZE.
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE, A POLICEMAN.
HE THOUGHT I WAS IN TROUBLE.
ROGER: WE'RE BOTH...
HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS?
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING: YOU'RE FIRED.
HAVE A NICE DAY.
FIRED? RIGGS, WHAT'D YOU DO?
YOU'RE NOT FIRED.
NO, YOU'RE NOT. JUST TAKE IT EASY.
RIGGS: YOU CAN'T FIRE HER
FOR SOMETHING I DID.
I DON'T CARE WHOSE MISTAKE IT WAS!
SHE'S FIRED!
RIGGS: I APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE.
DON'T PUSH HIM!
DIRECTOR: ALL OF YOU, GO!
JUST TAKE IT EASY. DON'T PUSH HIM.
DIRECTOR: GET OFF MY SET, ALL RIGHT?
WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?
GET OFF MY SET!
ON ANY NORMAL DAY,
I'D SMACK YOU IN THE MOUTH.
IS THAT SO?
DON'T!
IT'S A NORMAL DAY.
I'M SORRY. LISTEN, ARE YOU OKAY? I'M SORRY.
RIGGS: I'M ALL THUMBS! HE FELL DOWN!
LET ME HELP YOU.
I SAID, DON'T HIT HIM!
RIGGS: IS SHE FIRED?
DIRECTOR: YES, SHE'S FIRED!
RIGGS: IS SHE FIRED?
DIRECTOR: NO, NO.
ROGER: IT'S OKAY.
RIGGS: DOES SHE GET A RAISE?
DIRECTOR: YES! I SAID, "YES"!
RIGGS: GOOD.
RIGGS: RIANNE, I THINK YOU HAVE
A NEW FRIEND HERE.
WE'D LIKE YOU TO COME BACK.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS FROM CREW]
ROGER: YOU CAN'T SETTLE EVERY PROBLEM
WITH YOUR FISTS.
- I COULDN'T USE MY GUN WITH THAT CROWD.
- SIX MORE DAYS.
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.
DID RIANNE GET HER JOB BACK?
DID SHE GET A RAISE?
I DON'T HEAR A "THANK YOU."
MAYBE I SHOULD BECOME A HOLLYWOOD AGENT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ROGER: IT WON'T WORK.
RIGGS: WHY?
ROGER: YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KILLER INSTINCT.
RIGGS: SON OF A BITCH!
- WE SHOULD'VE PUT A BAG ON THE METER.
- I'LL PUT IT IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.
OH, YEAH? GOOD MAN.
IT'S FULL. PUT IT IN THE BACK SEAT.
- YOU REALLY LIKE THOSE THINGS?
- THESE? THEY'RE GOOD.
[ROGER CHUCKLES]
YOU CAN EAT A BOX OF THEM
AND STILL BE DYING FOR A CIGARETTE.
[ROGER CHUCKLES]
- DID YOU CUT YOURSELF SHAVING?
- YEAH.
RIGGS: OLD RAZOR?
OLD FACE.
YOU'RE LETTING THIS RETIREMENT THING
GET YOU DOWN.
SPEND A FEW MORE YEARS
TO GET USED TO THE IDEA. WHY QUIT?
- I'VE GOT PLANS FOR MY RETIREMENT.
- OH, YEAH, PLANS.
- I DO. BIG PLANS.
- BIG PLANS?
- I'VE HAD THEM FOR A LONG TIME.
- LIKE WHAT?
LIKE...
- THINGS, MAN!
- THINGS!
THINGS!
THINGS THAT I'VE PUT OFF.
OH, THOSE THINGS. I'VE GOT THOSE, TOO.
I SEE YOU'VE GIVEN THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT.
[ROGER SIGHS]
YEAH.
I'VE GIVEN IT A LOT OF THOUGHT.
[GUNSHOT]
[DEEP SIGH]
RIGGS: [YELLS] GODDAMN IT!
COP: WHAT'S GOING ON?
RIGGS: I'M PISSED OFF. YOU NEED A REASON?
COP: I THOUGHT I HEARD GUNFIRE.
RIGGS: GET YOUR HEARING CHECKED!
PUT THAT AWAY!
WHAT'RE YOU LOOKING AT?
HEY, MAN. PEACE.
[THUNDEROUS GUN BLASTS]
COP 1: WHY'D YOU CALL US DOWN HERE?
RIGGS: HOW'RE YOU DOING, SON?
RIGGS: DOES YOUR MOTHER
KNOW YOU'RE HERE?
RIGGS: DID YOU DO THIS?
COP 2: NICE SHOOTING.
BETTER THAN BILLY THE KID.
DIAPER RASH MAKES YOU CRANKY.
GIVE IT TO YOUR MOM.
MAYBE SHE'LL STICK IT ON THE REFRIGERATOR.
- CAN I BORROW YOUR GLASSES?
- YEAH.
RIGGS: WHO'S WEARING?
ROGER, YOU ARE.
WHY ME? YOU GUYS SHOULD BE WEARING.
SQUAD MEMBER:
MR. MURTAUGH, LET ME ASSIST YOU.
I DON'T NEED HELP.
I'VE BEEN DRESSING MYSELF SINCE I WAS 30.
- OKAY, MAN, JUST TRYING TO HELP.
- GET BACK.
ALL YOU PERVERTS, TURN YOUR HEADS.
COP 3: TAKE IT OFF, BABY!
ROGER: HOLD THIS SHIRT.
SQUAD MEMBER: YOU'RE WEARING A GIRDLE!
- HE'S GOT A GIRDLE!
- THIS IS NOT A GIRDLE.
ROGER: THIS IS NOT A GIRDLE. IT'S MY BACK!
MY BACK WENT OUT ON ME.
I HURT MY BACK THIS MORNING LIFTING WEIGHTS.
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
RIGGS: I SAW HIM DO IT.
EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.
I WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT
THESE... IOVELY BULLETS.
CUTE.
NOTICE THE SMOOTH JACKET.
PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE TIP.
NOW YOU'VE ALL SEEN THESE VESTS
STOP A.357 MAGNUM BULLET.
ALL: YEAH.
RIGGS: OKAY.
OBSERVE.
[GUN BLAST]
[GUN CHAMBER CLICKS]
[PULLEY MECHANISM HUMS]
RIGGS: SON OF A BITCH!
COP 1: ARMOR-PIERCING BULLETS?
RIGGS: YEAH, COP KILLERS.
THOSE BULLETS CAME FROM THE GUN
OF A SUSPECT WE ARRESTED YESTERDAY.
THEY'RE OUT THERE ON THE STREETS.
VESTS ARE OPTIONAL, BOYS AND GIRLS.
ESPECIALLY BOYS.
SEE YOU, RIGGS.
ROGER: COP KILLERS.
[WHISPERS] SON OF A BITCH.
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO BILLY PHELPS.
I'LL HAVE HIM BROUGHT IN FOR INTERROGATION.
I'M HERE TO TALK TO BILLY PHELPS.
- CAN I SEE YOUR ID, PLEASE?
- SURE.
WILLIAM PHELPS, ARMORED CAR SUSPECT.
HE'S BEEN MOVED TO INTERROGATION.
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS?
- SURE. I'VE BEEN THERE A LOT.
ROGER: SAME FLOOR.
[WHISPERS] I GUESS NOW YOU'RE RETIRING,
THAT SWISS BANK ACCOUNT...
...WILL COME IN PRETTY HANDY.
HOW MUCH YOU GOT IN THERE, A MILLION?
MILLION AND A HALF?
ROGER: FIVE.
RIGGS: FIVE?
WELL, YOU DESERVE IT.
IT'S BETTER THAN THOSE
MISERABLE DRUG DEALERS GETTING IT.
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
DON'T SWEAT IT. YOU LAUNDERED IT,
DIDN'T YOU? THEY CAN'T TRACE IT.
RIGGS: THEY CAN'T TRACE IT.
ROGER: WHAT?
SO LONG AS I GET AN INVITE
TO CASA DE MURTAUGH, I'M HAPPY.
CASA WHAT?
- I'VE NEVER BEEN TO PORTUGAL.
- STOP JOKING.
SHE'S A COP!
I KNOW SHE'S A COP.
SHE'S PROBABLY ON THE TAKE, TOO.
THE WHOLE FORCE IS BENT.
RIGGS: SHE MAY BE WEARING A SKIRT,
BUT WE'RE ALL BROTHERS.
YOU KNOW I HAVE NOTHING.
I AIN'T BEEN TO PORTUGAL.
RIGGS: LISTEN TO ME.
LORNA: [WHISPERS] SON OF A BITCH.
OFFICER: HOW'RE YOU DOING?
LORNA: FINE.
OFFICER: WHO IS IT TODAY?
RIGGS & LORNA: BILLY PHELPS.
WHO'RE YOU?
FLY ME. I'M YOUR FRIENDLY
PORTUGUESE AIRLINE.
SHE'S INFERNAL AFFAIRS, ROG.
LORNA: HOW'D YOU KNOW?
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF LOOKING AT YOUR FILE FOLDER.
LORNA COLE.
- AND YOU'RE SERGEANT MURTAUGH.
- I USED TO BE.
WHAT'S INFERNAL REPAIRS
WANT WITH OUR COLLAR?
WE'RE TAKING OVER, THANKS.
NOBODY TOLD US THEY WERE TAKING OVER.
NOBODY HAS TO TELL YOU ANYTHING,
PATROLMAN.
I WANT TO GO AND SEE THE CAPTAIN.
YOU WANT TO SEE THE CAPTAIN?
LET'S GO SEE THE CAPTAIN.
LORNA: AND PUT ON A VEST.
RIGGS: OH, ARE YOU WEARING ONE?
ROGER: JUST TAKE IT EASY, MAN.
[RIGGS SIGHS DEEPLY]
[ELEVATOR RINGS]
HEY, GUYS. PHELPS, WILLIAM.
ACTUALLY, HIS NAME'S BILLY.
OFFICER: YOU, TOO?
OFFICER: POPULAR GUY TODAY.
JACK: SOMEBODY WITH HIM?
NO, NOT REALLY.
HE'S DOWN THE HALL TO THE RIGHT.
WANT TO SIGN IN HERE, SARGE?
RIGGS: MISS.
RIGGS: WHAT'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOING HERE?
MURPHY: DON'T START.
I JUST FOUND OUT MYSELF.
THIS IS HERMAN WALTERS,
CHIEF OF INTELLIGENCE.
YOU HAVEN'T MET HIS DAUGHTER,
LORNA DOONE.
LORNA: PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
THE PHELPS CASE HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED
TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
RIGGS: WHY?
MURPHY: I CAN'T TELL YOU.
WALTERS: THAT'S CLASSIFIED.
WE BUSTED OUR BUNS BUSTING THIS GUY.
WE BUSTED HIM.
BUSTED IS RIGHT.
HE SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE HOSPITAL.
ROGER: HE DIDN'T BUCKLE UP.
RIGGS: WE EVEN CITED HIM.
I KNOW, I READ YOUR REPORT.
LORNA: OUR CASES HAVE, UNFORTUNATELY,
CROSSED PATHS HERE.
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.
WE'LL TAKE OVER FROM HERE.
CAPTAIN, WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
WALTERS: THAT'S CLASSIFIED.
ROGER: NO, I'M TALKING TO HIM.
I'M TELLING YOU...
NO, I SAID, "CAPTAIN."
I'M TALKING TO THE CAPTAIN.
WALTERS: THAT'S CLASSIFIED!
ROGER: I'M TALKING TO HIM!
RIGGS: THAT'S BULLSHIT!
MURPHY: RIGGS!
MURPHY: MAYBE THESE GUYS CAN CONTRIBUTE
SOMETHING TO THIS CASE?
FROM THEIR RECORDS,
THEY ONLY CONTRIBUTE MAYHEM AND CHAOS.
NO, I'M CHAOS, HE'S MAYHEM.
WE'RE A DOUBLE ACT.
WHAT ARE WE,
REQUIRED READING OR SOMETHING?
AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU ARE.
IT'S A CROSS BETWEEN POLICE GAZETTE
AND MAD MAGAZINE.
RIGGS: WHAT'S WRONG WITH MAD?
LORNA: NOTHING, I USED TO READ IT...
YOU'VE GOT SOME TASTE.
...WHEN I WAS 12.
RIGGS, LET'S GO.
ROGER: WE BUSTED HIM,
WE CAN TALK TO HIM.
WALTERS: CAPTAIN.
MURPHY: RIGGS. MURTAUGH.
MURPHY: GET YOUR ASSES BACK HERE.
YOU'LL BE NEEDING THESE.
I'M REINSTATING BOTH OF YOU.
ROGER: DON'T YOU JUST LOVE HIM?
RIGGS: YEAH.
ROGER: GOD!
YOU REALLY ARE A BEAUTIFUL MAN.
JUST GET RID OF THE BLUES.
MURPHY: THEY DON'T GO WITH YOUR PONYTAIL.
RIGGS: ABSOLUTELY NOT.
RIGGS: YEAH, RIGHT.
GET A HAIRCUT!
OF COURSE, I WON'T.
WALTERS: YOU'VE EXCEEDED YOUR AUTHORITY,
CAPTAIN.
MURPHY: THAT'S NOT HOW I SEE IT.
WALTERS: THAT'S HOW THE CHIEF WILL SEE IT.
- TAKE IT UP WITH HIM.
- I THINK I WILL.
CATCH UP WITH THEM. WE DON'T WANT THIS
SCREWED UP WITH COWBOY TACTICS.
SON OF A BITCH.
HI, BILLY.
JACK!
BYE, BILLY.
[MULTIPLE SILENCED GUNSHOTS]
SEE YOU, BILLY.
OFFICER: SERGEANT,
DID YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED?
NOT REALLY. IT'S A DEAD ISSUE, I'M AFRAID.
RIGGS: HOW LONG HAS PHELPS
BEEN DOING THIS?
LORNA: DOING WHAT?
RIGGS: THIS ARMORED-CAR THING.
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN ARMORED CARS.
I DON'T THINK SHE'S TELLING US EVERYTHING.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
BOY, THESE SIX DAYS ARE GOING TO BE ROUGH.
ROGER: GOD, BE GOOD TO ME.
MURPHY: SHIT, SON OF A BITCH KNEW
THERE WAS A CAMERA IN THE WALL.
DAMN IT!
HE DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS ONE
IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM.
ROGER: THERE ISN'T.
LORNA: WE INSTALLED THEM SIX MONTHS AGO.
LORNA: EVERY STATION.
MURPHY: THAT'S GREAT.
SIX MONTHS AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT?
THIS IS THE "POLICE POLICE," CAPTAIN.
"POLICE POLICE." VERY GOOD. CAN YOU SAY
THAT THREE TIMES IN A ROW, REAL FAST?
RIGGS: WHY? AM I GETTING TO YOU?
LORNA: ARE YOU TRYING TO BAIT ME?
I'M A MASTER AT IT.
THAT FIGURES.
BAITING MASTER. GREAT, MAN,
TRY ALL THE TRICKS.
FREEZE THAT. STOP IT.
MURPHY: JACK TRAVIS.
BOTH: WHO?
LIEUTENANT JACK EDWARD TRAVIS.
HE WAS ONE OF US.
MURPHY: HELL OF A BRUTAL COP.
HE COULD BEAT A CONFESSION OUT OF ANYONE.
A DIRTY COP.
LORNA: I'VE NEVER SEEN
SO MANY SUSPENSIONS...
... AND REPRIMANDS AND CHARGES
OF MISCONDUCT.
HE'S ALSO AS TOUGH AS THEY COME.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
I DON'T KNOW.
HIS PARTNER AND HIM WERE ON A STAKEOUT.
HE WENT FOR COFFEE, NEVER CAME BACK.
LOOKS LIKE HE'S HAD
ONE CAPPUCCINO TOO MANY.
WE'D BETTER BRIEF WALTERS.
LORNA: EXCUSE ME, CUTE STUFF.
RIGGS: THAT'S HARASSMENT.
ROGER: CUTE STUFF. THAT'S YOU.
RIGGS: CAPTAIN.
LORNA: BOYS, BOYS. JUST THE CAPTAIN.
YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS CASE ENDED
WHEN PHELPS HIT THE FLOOR.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK
AND BEAT YOUR STREET?
LEO: NOW'S THE TIME TO BUY.
MURPHY: NOT NOW.
- HEY, ROGER, ROGER!
- NOT NOW, LEO!
- NOT NOW!
- WE GOT TO TALK, BABE, OKAY?
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. YOU'VE GOT TERMITES.
TERMITES?
- OH, GOD!
- YOU'RE INFESTED!
THE ONLY THING HOLDING UP YOUR HOUSE
IS THE PAINT.
WE SHOULD GO.
LEO, COULD YOU GET THE PLACE FUMIGATED?
WE SHOULD PULL EVERY FILE ON THIS GUY.
I KNOW THIS GUY.
ARE YOU WATCHING GERALDO?
RIGGS: WHAT?
LEO: I KNOW THE GUY.
RIGGS: HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?
LEO: I'VE SEEN THE GUY BEFORE.
ROGER: WHERE?
LEO: I DON'T KNOW. I RECOGNIZE HIM...
HIS NAME IS JACK TRAVIS.
DOES THAT RING A BELL?
HANDS OFF THE CLOTHES. OKAY?
I'M THINKING. LET ME THINK.
IT WAS A BIG PARTY.
SOMEONE BROUGHT A MONKEY
THAT KNOCKED OVER THE SALAD BAR.
AND THIS GUY COMES IN
AND INTRODUCES ME TO ANOTHER GUY...
...WHO WANTS A FAVOR.
- I GOT IT! I GOT IT!
- WHAT?
HE'S GOT IT!
- I REMEMBER!
- YOU REMEMBER!
DON'T DO IT. DON'T LET THE EARRING FOOL YOU.
- WE'RE BACK. WE'RE BACK!
- YEAH. YEAH.
LISTEN, LISTEN.
CAN I HAVE A GUN THIS TIME?
[ECHOING] NO!
[CRASH, AMBIENT GAME NOISE]
[SCATTERED CHEERING, HOLLERING]
OKAY, THIS IS IT! THESE GUYS ALWAYS
WANTED ME TO DO FAVORS FOR THEM!
LIKE, SOME GUYS WANTED BROADS,
ANOTHER GUY WANTED CUBAN CIGARS.
YOUR GUY, HOCKEY!
LEO: THE BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE!
RIGGS: WHERE'RE THE SEATS?
ROGER: YEAH?
PROBABLY BY THE GLASS.
DOES "NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK"
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
WHY DON'T WE SPREAD OUT?
IF WE ALL TAKE A DIFFERENT DIRECTION,
IT'D BE LIKE OLD TIMES.
DON'T PUSH, LADY!
I'M ON POLICE BUSINESS HERE!
JUST TAKE IT EASY!

PLAY ON, BOYS.
[WHISTLE BLOWS, SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

OOH, OOH! RIGGS!
ROGER!
EXCUSE ME.
RIGGS!

YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, PAL. STAY CALM.
LEO: MAKE SURE YOU TELL MY MOTHER!
WHERE'D HE GO?
DOWN THERE!
SON OF A... BITCH!
HE THINKS I DON'T KNOW I'M DYING.
I KNOW IT.
ROGER: YOU'LL BE OKAY.
LEO: I'M DYING, ROGER.
I'M CHOKING, SEE?
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY DIE.
ROGER: LEO, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
MY BODY'S NUMB! I CAN'T FEEL IT!
I'M GOING TO DIE, I KNOW IT! WHAT?
YOU'RE LYING ON THE ICE.
LEO: THAT'S WHY I'M COLD?
ROGER: THAT'S WHY YOU'RE COLD.
- THAT'S WHY I'M NUMB?
- THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NUMB.
BUT HE SHOT ME. LOOK AT ALL THE BLOOD.
ROGER: IT'S JUST A FLESH WOUND.
LEO: SO IT'S OKAY.
HE'S OKAY, HE'S OKAY!
HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT! HE'S ALIVE!
[CROWD CHEERS]
DOCTOR: BRING HIM THIS WAY.
LEO: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
LEO: I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT SHOT.
DOCTOR: CALM DOWN.
RIGGS, ARE YOU HERE?
WE'RE ALL THE SAME NOW. WE ALL GOT SHOT.
DOCTOR: YOU'LL BE FINE.
RELAX.
I'M FINE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.
I CAN TAKE THIS.
DOCTOR: JUST CALM DOWN.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. AAH!
DOCTOR: YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE TONIGHT.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA.
YOU SHOULDN'T RUSH THIS, DOC.
RIGGS: YOU SHOULD REST UP.
A DUM-DUM WOUND CAN BE SERIOUS.
WHAT'S A "DUM-DUM WOUND"?
YOU DON'T KNOW? A GUY ON THE FORCE
GOT HIS THUMB SHOT OFF BY A DUM-DUM.
FROM THE SHOCK,
HE WAS DEAD TWO DAYS LATER.
DEAD TWO DAYS LATER?
LEO: HE DIED FROM DUM-DUMS?
DOCTOR: WE'LL KEEP YOU OVERNIGHT.
ROGER: MAKE IT TWO.
TWO DAYS?
OKAY, WE'LL KEEP HIM TWO DAYS.
IS THAT LEO'S CHART?
DOCTOR: TWO DAYS,
THEN YOU'LL BE AS GOOD AS NEW.
LEO: I SHOULD BE WITH THEM.
I SHOULD BE WITH... OW, OW!
HOW DO YOU SPELL, "PROCTOLOGICAL"?
ROGER: RECTAL EXAM?
- NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO LEO.
- SURE, WE CAN.
WHY'S SHE...
PLEASE, MR. GETZ.
DOCTOR: YOU'VE BEEN SHOT IN THE ARM?
LET HER TAKE IT. YOU'LL GET IT BACK.
DOCTOR: THERE'S A CLOCK IN YOUR ROOM.
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A "DUM-DUM WOUND"?
RIGGS: IT SOUNDED LIKE ONE
WHEN IT HAPPENED.
LEO: SHIT.
RIGGS: TAKE IT EASY. TWO DAYS.
DOCTOR: TWO DAYS AND YOU'LL BE OUT.
NO PROBLEM.
LEO: I'LL SEE YOU GUYS.
RIGGS: WE WON'T MAKE A MOVE
WITHOUT YOU.
I THOUGHT THAT BULLET SOUNDED DIFFERENT.
DOCTOR: RELAX.
THEY'LL BE THERE WHEN YOU GET OUT.
LEO: I'M FINE.
LEO: YOU OWN YOUR HOUSE, DOC?
DOCTOR: WHAT?
- YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE MY FACE?
- NO, SIR.
WATCH.
RIGGS: IT'S ABOUT TIME. THESE DOGGY TREATS
ARE OKAY, BUT I NEED SOME HUMAN FOOD.
ROGER: DON'T WORRY. I'LL MAKE YOU
THE BEST THING YOU'VE EVER HAD.
RIGGS: GOOD.
ROGER: YOU EVER EAT
ONE OF MY HAMBURGERS?
RIGGS: I'VE BEEN LUCKY SO FAR.
ROGER: FAST EDDIE!
ROGER: HOW'S BUSINESS?
EDDIE: BOOMING. CAN'T YOU TELL?
ROGER: YEAH, I'M LOOKING AT IT.
DID YOU MEET MY PARTNER?
I WANT TO COOK ONE
OF THOSE MONSTER BURGERS FOR HIM.
EDDIE: GO FOR IT.
ROGER: ALL RIGHT.
RIGGS: YOU'LL LET HIM COOK?
EDDIE: DO I HAVE A CHOICE?
ROGER: NO, BECAUSE IT'S WEDNESDAY.
RIGGS: HE'S TOO BIG TO ARGUE WITH.
IN THAT CASE, GIVE ME A MACROG.
RIGGS: HOLD THE HAIR.
DID YOU WASH YOUR HANDS?
KEEP JOKING. BUT I GUARANTEE
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS BURGER...
...AND YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY FRIENDS,
YOU KNOW THAT, EXCEPT YOU.
ROGER: HE'S A COMEDIAN IN HIS SPARE TIME.
WHEN IS HE GONNA SAY SOMETHING FUNNY?
ARE YOU GONNA PUT THAT OUT?
RIGGS: YOU'RE FINISHED WITH IT, YEAH?
DO YOU MIND? THANKS.
SORRY. I WAS JUST LOOKING AT IT.
CHEW ON THIS ONION.
HE'S QUITTING, SO HELP HIM.
I WAS ONLY LOOKING AT IT.
ROGER: THE FIRST THING IS THE FAT.
ROGER: EVERYONE SAYS, "CUT THE FAT."
MY UNCLE SAID, "YOU CUT THE FAT,
YOU KILL THE BURGER." RIGHT?
EDDIE: YEAH.
ROGER: THERE'S AN ART TO IT.
YOU JUST CAN'T PLOP THIS ON THE GRILL.
ROGER: GENTLY COAX THE FLAVORS OUT.
YO, HEY, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
ROGER: A LITTLE PEPPER,
THEN YOU MASSAGE IT A LITTLE BIT.
JUST A LITTLE BIT.
[SINGS] "SWEET, SWEET MEAT"
SHIT, MAN, FEEL IT.
OKAY, GUYS!
RIGGS: LAPD. LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS! GET THEM UP!

I WANT TO SEE YOUR HANDS, RIGHT NOW!
[MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS]
BACK ME UP, RIGGS!
ROGER: DARRYL?
FUCK, NO!
FUCK, NO!
CALL AN AMBULANCE!
CALL AN AMBULANCE! BREATHE!
ROGER: PLEASE, BREATHE!
BREATHE!
CALL AN AMBULANCE!
COME ON! BREATHE! OH, GOD!
FUCK, IT'S DARRYL!
OH, GOD, DON'T DO THIS TO ME! BREATHE!
RIGGS: HE'S DEAD.

ROGER: GOD, DON'T DO THIS!
RIGGS: HE'S DEAD.
RIGGS: HE'S DEAD! ROG, HE'S DEAD!
HE'S DEAD, ROG!
DON'T MESS WITH THE CORPSE.
HE'S DEAD. COME ON, MAN,
IT WAS A CLEAN SHOOT.
IT'S OKAY, IT WAS A CLEAN SHOOT.
HE WAS GONNA DO YOU
AND HE WAS GONNA DO ME.
IT'S OKAY. ARE YOU OKAY?
IT'S NOT OKAY.
I KNOW THAT KID.
I KNOW THAT KID.
ROGER: HE'S NICK'S FRIEND.
[PHONE RINGS]
NICK: I GOT IT, MOM.
TRISH: I'LL GET IT.
HELLO?
HI, MARTIN.
HE'S NOT HERE.
[WHISPERS] OH, MY GOD!
THANKS.
[CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT]
FUCK!
[TIRES SCREECH]
RIGGS: HOW'RE YOU DOING?
TAKING YOUR VITAMINS?
MURPHY: RIGGS, HOW'S MURTAUGH?
RIGGS: HE'S GOOD. HE'S FINE.
- I'M SURE HE'S ANYTHING BUT FINE.
- REALLY, HE'S OKAY.
- I'D REALLY LIKE TO TALK TO HIM.
- THAT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO LEAVE HIM ALONE.
LET'S GET SOMETHING FOR YOUR COLD.
DOCTOR: I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
LORNA: WE HAVE TO TALK.
RIGGS: TALKING TO YOU IS BAD FOR MY IMAGE.
LORNA: I'M AFRAID I INSIST.
RIGGS: OH, YOU INSIST?
IN THAT CASE, LET'S FIND SOMEPLACE PRIVATE.
STEP INTO MY ORIFICE.
RIGGS: HEY, BECKER, HOW'S IT HANGING?
BECKER: HEY, RIGGS.
BECKER: CLIP ANY WRONG WIRES LATELY?
RIGGS: I HAVEN'T DONE THAT
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.
NEXT TIME, WAIT FOR THE BOMB SQUAD.
BECKER: YEAH, IT'S OUR JOB.
I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
WE SAVED A CAT, THOUGH.
GREAT. I LOVE CATS.
RIGGS: GO AHEAD, TALK. I'M LISTENING.
YOU PURPOSEFULLY WITHHELD INFORMATION
CONCERNING A CASE UNDER MY INVESTIGATION.
DAMN RIGHT, I DID.
BECKER: CAREFUL, SHE'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
YOU HAD A TIP ON TRAVIS.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SHARED IT WITH ME.
NO, I TAKE THAT BACK.
YOU WERE REQUIRED TO SHARE IT WITH ME.
I WAS "REQUIRED" TO SHARE IT WITH YOU?
I DON'T HAVE TO SHARE SHIT WITH YOU.
SCHOOL YARD RULES: IF YOU DON'T SCRATCH
MY BACK, I DON'T THROW YOU...
LORNA: OH, COME ON, RIGGS.
I CAN'T DO THAT!
RIGGS: YES, YOU CAN!
WHY DON'T YOU CUT OUT
THIS CLASSIFIED BULLSHIT!
RIGHT NOW! IT'S GIVING ME THE SHITS!
WE'RE COPS. YOU'RE A COP, I'M A COP.
WE'RE BOTH ON THE SAME SIDE, RIGHT?
RIGGS: RIGHT?
LORNA: RIGHT!
GOOD! WHY DON'T WE START TO ACT LIKE IT.
THERE ARE KIDS OUT THERE. BABIES. NO
BRAINS, BUT THEY GOT AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
RIGGS: YESTERDAY,
MY PARTNER NAILED THIS KID...
I KNOW ABOUT MURTAUGH.
YEAH. AND I'M SORRY, RIGGS.
YEAH.
[SIGHS DEEPLY]
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME IN ON THIS?
I CAN HELP YOU.
I REALLY WANT TO HELP YOU,
IF YOU'LL LET ME. LET ME.
WHAT DO YOU SAY? HAVE WE GOT A DEAL?
WASH YOUR HANDS...
...AND MEET ME IN MY OFFICE.
YEAH.
RIGGS: I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
LORNA: MAC-10, 9 MM, SEMI-AUTOMATIC...
BOTH: CONVERTED TO AUTOMATIC
WITH 36 ROUNDS IN THE MAGAZINE.
"ON A SESAME SEED BUN."
VERY ILLEGAL.
THE GUN HAS A HISTORY.
WANNA KNOW ABOUT IT?
TELL ME.
"KILLED A CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK
IN LA COUNTY, JULY 1990.
"USED IN A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING
IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, AUGUST 1990.
"CONFISCATED BY A TRUANT OFFICER
OF THE LA SCHOOL BOARD, OCTOBER 1990."
SCHEDULED FOR DESTRUCTION BY LAPD
SIX WEEKS AGO.
"SCHEDULED FOR DESTRUCTION?"
LORNA: BUT IT NEVER GOT THERE.
INSTEAD, IT FOUND ITS WAY
INTO THE HANDS OF A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY...
...WHO FIRED IT ON A POLICE OFFICER,
YOUR PARTNER.
I THOUGHT IT LOOKED FAMILIAR.
LORNA:
THAT GUN AND 15,000 OTHERS LIKE IT...
...WERE STOLEN FROM A POLICE STORAGE FACILITY
BEFORE THEY COULD BE DESTROYED.
THEY SHOULD BE PAPER CLIPS RIGHT NOW,
OR LICENSE PLATES.
ANYTHING BUT A GUN. HERE WE ARE
BUSTING OUR ASSES ON THE STREETS...
...GETTING THESE WEAPONS OUT OF CIRCULATION
AND NOW THEY'RE HEADED BACK OUT.
BY BUSTING PHELPS, YOU STUMBLED ONTO
SOMETHING THE LAPD'S TRIED TO KEEP QUIET.
THAT'S WHY INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS ONTO THIS.
THEY THINK THIS IS AN INSIDE JOB.
LORNA: THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY KNEW POLICE PROCEDURES.
THEY KNEW WHERE THE GUNS WERE STORED
AND HOW TO GET IN.
THEY EVEN KNEW THE SORTING CODES
ON THE CONTAINERS...
...BECAUSE THEY TOOK THE AUTOMATICS
AND LEFT THE JUNK BEHIND.
LORNA: IT ALL POINTED TO A COP.
RIGGS: OR AN EX-COP.
RIGHT.
BOTH: TRAVIS.
AND YOU LET HIM SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS.
THAT'S CLOSER THAN YOU EVER GOT.
CLOSE, RIGGS?
CLOSE IS A LINGERIE SHOP
WITHOUT A FRONT WINDOW.
DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR A RIDE?
SURE, WHERE ARE WE GOING?
LORNA: IT'S A SURPRISE.
OH, I LOVE SURPRISES.
RIGGS: WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
LORNA: I ACCESSED BILLY PHELPS'
PHONE RECORDS ON MY COMPUTER.
LORNA: HE MADE A DOZEN CALLS
TO THIS ADDRESS.
RIGGS: THAT WAS NICE OF YOU
TO STEAL THAT INFORMATION.
LORNA: SEMANTICS, RIGGS.
RIGGS: "SEMANTICS"?
RIGGS: I'M ALWAYS UP FOR SOME ANTICS.
LET'S GO ON THREE.
LORNA: ONE.
RIGGS: ON THREE, OR THREE AND THEN GO?
LORNA: WHAT?
NEVER MIND. ONE, TWO, THREE.
LORNA: I'VE GOT YOU.
[FEROCIOUS GROWLING]
IT LOOKS LIKE BILLY'S GRANDMOTHER
OWNS A BIG DOG.
IT'S NOT A DOG. IT'S A HORSE.
LORNA: I HATE DOGS, RIGGS.
I DON'T GET IT.
YOU DON'T GET WHAT?
IT'S A DOG. IT'S A FUCKING DOG.
I DON'T GET, "CLOSE, IS A LINGERIE SHOP
WITHOUT A FRONT WINDOW." I DON'T GET IT.
LATER.
[GROWLING]
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
I CAN'T SHOOT A DOG.
PEOPLE, OKAY, BUT NOT DOGS.
I SHOULD TRY TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH HIM.
MAKE FRIENDS?
NOW DON'T RUN, BECAUSE HE'LL ONLY
CHASE YOU DOWN AND KILL YOU.
RIGGS: HERE, BOY.
HERE, BOY.
[LOW AGGRESSIVE GROWLING]
SHIT!
GOOD BOY!
[DOG BARKS AND GROWLS,
RIGGS WHIMPERS]
RIGGS?
[RIGGS GROWLS]
YOU'RE CRAZY.
[RIGGS PANTS AND WHIMPERS]
WANT SOME?
RIGGS: ARE YOU HUNGRY?
YOU'RE A HUNGRY BOY.
DOESN'T ANYBODY FEED YOU? COME ON.
HERE'S MORE. LEAVE SOME FOR ME.
RIGGS: VERY SLOWLY, AS IF YOU'RE NOT HERE,
JUST WALK AWAY.
YOU WANT ME TO GO?
YEAH. THIS IS A GUY SORT OF THING.
LORNA: "GUY SORT OF THING?"
RIGGS: ARE YOU ALONE?
STAY, STAY.
HATCHETT: COME ON, LET'S GO.
HATCHETT: HOW MANY IS THAT?
- FIFTY-FIVE.
- FIFTY-FIVE. ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT EIGHT MORE.
WE'LL GET THESE LATER. LET'S GO.
HI, FELLAS.
WHAT'S IN ALL THESE BOXES?
[RIGGS WAILS]
[THUMP]
HATCHETT: EASY, LET'S NOT KILL HIM, YET.
LET'S SEE WHO HE IS FIRST, ALL RIGHT?
[GASPING] YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.
HATCHETT: SHUT HIM UP!
"SERGEANT MARTIN RIGGS."
- GET THE TRUCK READY.
- RIGHT.
SO, SERGEANT RIGGS...
... HOW DID YOU FIND US?
FREEZE! POLICE!
ANOTHER ONE?
WE NEED A NEW FUCKING DOG.
GET YOUR HANDS UP, ASSHOLE.
GET THEM UP!
[COUGHS AND GASPS]
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER.
LORNA: THAT'S BETTER.
[COUGHS]
VERY GOOD.
DROP IT, MISS.
RIGGS: NOW, LOOK!
[CAR ENGINE REVS]
[TIRES SCREECH]
RIGGS: OKAY, I'M ON! NO, I'M NOT!
WAIT!
WAIT, WAIT!
RIGGS: SERGEANT COLE!
GET DOWN! GET DOWN!
[MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS WHIZZ, GLASS SHATTERS]
HATCHETT: GET THOSE CASES
AND KILL THAT DOG!
[TIRES SCREECH]
[GUNSHOTS]
[DOG BARKING]
RIGGS: STOP!
- THE DOG. WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO FIGHT?
- CATHOLIC SCHOOL. FORGET THE DOG!
RIGGS: HERE, BOY!
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE DOG!
RIGGS: HOLD IT, HOLD IT. HURRY UP!
GOOD DOG. GOOD PUPPY. GO!
STOP!
LORNA: WHAT?
RIGGS: GUNS.
RIGGS: IT'S FULL OF GUNS.
LORNA: GRAB ONE!
RIGGS: YOU GRAB ONE!
LORNA: CHICKEN.
RIGGS: STEP ON IT.
[GUNSHOTS]
GET THAT CRATE! COME ON!
[DOG BARKING]
TYRONE: HATCHETT, YOU SAID NOT TO WORRY
ABOUT THE POLICE...
... BUT THE COPS ARE ALL OVER YOU!
THEY GOT MY GUNS.
THEY'LL COME AFTER ME, NEXT!
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THE DEAL'S OFF!
GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF, TYRONE.
WE HAVE A DEAL.
NOBODY BACKS OUT.
TYRONE: YOU SAID YOU HAD THE COPS
UNDER CONTROL.
I SEE THAT ISN'T SO. GIVE ME ONE REASON...
TYRONE:
... WHY I SHOULD DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD REASON.
TYRONE, THIS IS TRAVIS.
YOU BACK OUT NOW, AND I'LL MAKE SURE
ONLY YOUR DENTIST CAN IDENTIFY THE BODY.
IS THAT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON FOR YOU?
BUT I NEED AMMO!
I'M OUT OF BUSINESS WITHOUT AMMO!
I NEED THE GOOD STUFF.
YOU'LL GET THE AMMO. THE GOOD STUFF.
"THE GOOD STUFF." JESUS.
JACK: TIME TO PAY
ANOTHER VISIT TO THE LAPD.
YOU LOOK LIKE I FEEL.
HEY?
RIGGS: HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING
I CAN PUT ON MY HEAD?
THE HAT IN THE CLOSET.
YOU'RE ALL HEART. HERE I THOUGHT
YOU'D GET ALL TENDER AND MATERNAL.
I WAS RAISED WITH FOUR BROTHERS.
WE GOT HURT OFTEN, BUT IF NO BONES WERE
BROKEN OR BLOOD GUSHED, NOBODY CARED.
LOOK, BLOOD. SEE? BLOOD.
LORNA: IT'S NOT GUSHING.
RIGGS: IT WAS FREE FALLING EARLIER.
COULD YOU BRING ME A NEEDLE AND THREAD?
SOME PEROXIDE. I'LL PATCH IT UP MYSELF.
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.
I WASN'T.
WHAT'S WITH YOU?
[THREE STOOGES THEME MUSIC PLAYS
ON COMPUTER]
RIGGS: BOYS.
LORNA: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LORNA: I SAID NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING.
RIGGS: IT CAME ON BY ITSELF.
ALL BY ITSELF. WHAT ARE YOU, A WISE GUY?
RIGGS: YOU DON'T LIKE TO SHARE YOUR TOYS?
- THIS ISN'T A TOY.
- WHAT IS IT?
- THIS IS A WEAPON.
- A WEAPON?
USED PROPERLY, A VERY EFFECTIVE WEAPON.
WHAT, DO YOU THROW IT AT PEOPLE?
LORNA: YOU'LL GIVE YOURSELF A HERNIA.
COME HERE. SIT DOWN.
LORNA: RIGHT HERE.
RIGGS: TAKE A LITTLE OFF THE TOP.
LORNA: RIGHT HERE.
RIGGS: DO YOU BRING
ALL YOUR INTERROGATIONS HOME?
LORNA: WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
RIGGS: IT'S BACK HERE.
RIGGS: CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
LORNA: TURN YOUR HEAD.
RIGGS: CAREFUL.
LORNA: THIS?
LORNA: THIS SCRATCH?
RIGGS: IT FEELS LIKE THE GRAND CANYON.
OH, GOD.
HOLD STILL.
LORNA: OH, GOD. WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.
BE GENTLE WITH ME.
I SEE THIS ISN'T VIRGIN TERRITORY.
WHAT IS THIS? A KNIFE?
THAT'S AN AX.
SOME GUY MISTOOK MY HEAD FOR A LOG.
- THAT'S A NATURAL MISTAKE.
- WHAT, I HAVE A WOODEN HEAD?
- LOOK AT THAT.
- A KNIFE.
KNIFE? THAT'S VERY NICE.
THIS IS ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S PAVEMENT, DRAGGED DOWN CRENSHAW.
THAT'S GREAT. LOOK AT THAT TEXTURE.
LOOK AT THIS.
SAME THING. THIRD AND HIGHLAND.
RIGGS: DRAGGED FOR ABOUT HALF A BLOCK.
LORNA: THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
FEEL THAT TEXTURE. CHEESE-GRATER TIME.
RIGGS: MOVING TRUCK.
LORNA: MOVING TRUCK?
MOVING BULLET.
RIGGS: MOVING BULLET?
LORNA: HERE. THIS IS THE BEST.
IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE BACK.
RIGGS: RIGHT THROUGH?
YOU'RE LUCKY. WAS IT A.22?
IT'S A.38.
THAT'S A.38? THAT'S WIMPY.
THIS IS A.38.
YOURS IS BIGGER THAN MINE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
MAYBE NOT, BUT LOOK.
A WHOLE FAMILY OF.44S ON THE BACK.
RIGGS: THERE THEY ARE.
LORNA: THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
ONE HIT MY LUNG. I WAS BREATHING
BLOOD BUBBLES. IT WAS DISGUSTING.
BLOOD BUBBLES. OKAY.
RIGGS: YOU GOT ONE?
PUMP-ACTION. 12-GAUGE.
LORNA: RIGHT DOWN HERE. WENT THROUGH.
RIGGS: THAT MUST HAVE HURT.
LORNA: RIGHT.
NOT TOO CLOSE.
RIGGS, IF HE WERE THAT CLOSE, I'D BE DEAD.
I CAN BEAT IT. I CAN BEAT IT.
- I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
- YOU GOTTA SEE THIS.
LORNA: I BELIEVE YOU.
RIGGS: THIS GUY HAD A KNIFE.
RIGGS: YOU'LL LOVE IT. HE STUCK IT IN MY LEG
AND RAN IT AROUND EIGHT TIMES.
LORNA: I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
RIGGS: LOOK!
NO, I SAID FORGET IT.
THIS IS A BLUE-RIBBON EVENT.
FORGET IT, RIGGS.
YOU STARTED THIS.
LORNA: YEAH, I CAN END IT.
RIGGS: YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A VERY POOR LOSER.
I DIDN'T LOSE.
RIGGS: YES, YOU DID.
LORNA: NO, I DIDN'T LOSE.
RIGGS: YOU LOST.
LORNA: I CONCEDED.
NO, I CONCEDED. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN LOSING AND CONCEDING.
YOU CONCEDED OR YOU'RE CONCEITED?
LORNA: YOU THINK I'M CONCEITED?
RIGGS: YEAH.
TELL ME YOU LOST. ADMIT TO IT.
I'LL GET YOU A BAND-AID.
RIGGS: TELL ME YOU LOST.
LORNA: I SAID, "DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING."
[SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC, BACKGROUND]
YOU'RE GOING TO SMACK
THE SHIT OUT OF ME, RIGHT?
I CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.
THIS COULD BE A SERIOUS ETHICAL BREACH HERE.

YOU'RE DOING PRETTY WELL.
TRISH DIDN'T SEND ME.
RIANNE CAME TO SEE ME.
SHE ASKED ME TO FIND YOU.
TO YOUR PLACE?
WELL, THAT'S WHERE I AM.

- I'M FINE.
OH, SHIT!
WHERE'S SERGEANT MURTAUGH?
RIGGS: WHAT?
ROGER: IT'S HER!
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND
THE GOOD-IOOKING SERGEANT MURTAUGH?
DELORES: HI, SKINNY!
DELORES: DELORES. REMEMBER ME?
RIGGS: I REMEMBER YOU.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND
THE LOVELY SERGEANT MURTAUGH?
ACTUALLY, HE'S COWERING DOWN
ON ALL FOURS RIGHT BEHIND THIS COUNTER.
DELORES: WHERE IS THE SERGEANT?
RIGGS: HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.
RIGGS: BUT HE'S TALKED OF NOTHING
BUT YOU ALL WEEK.
DELORES: SHUT MY MOUTH.
RIGGS: THE MAN'S ON FIRE.
DELORES: WHAT'S THE MATTER, BABY?
RIGGS: A LITTLE SCIATICA.
DELORES: YOU TELL HIM DELORES WAS HERE.
YOU TELL THAT MAN...
...THAT HE'S THE JAM IN MY JELLYROLL.
I'LL SEE YOU, BABY, OKAY. BYE-BYE.
SEE YOU.
RIGGS: DELORES SAYS YOU'RE
"THE JAM IN HER JELLYROLL."
I HEARD!
RIGGS: THAT'S A LOT OF WOMAN.
SHE CALLS ME ALL THE TIME. SHE LEAVES ME
NOTES. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE LED HER ON.
LED HER ON? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
SERGEANT, WE HAVE GOT TO TALK.
DOCTOR: YOU'VE GOT TO COME SEE ME.
WE'VE GOT TO WORK. COME ON. LET'S GO.
RIGGS: THANKS ANYWAY, FOR YOUR CONCERN.
ROGER: THANKS, DOC.
ROGER: YOU'RE A BEAUTY.
RIGGS: COMING?
ROGER: A REAL BEAUTY. I'M COMING.
[CAR ENGINE HUMMING]
GOOD AFTERNOON, CAPTAIN.
JACK: THAT'S GOOD, MURPH.
SEE HOW EASY THAT WAS?
[TIRES SQUEALING]
JACK: I LOVE IT DOWN HERE. DON'T YOU?
THIS PLACE IS BETTER THAN THE SWAP MEET.
BEST BARGAINS IN TOWN.
COP: GIVE ME THE LOCK-UP KEYS.
THOSE GUYS FROM THE GARAGE,
THEY'RE ALL EX-CONS.
THEY WERE ALL BUSTED BY THE SAME
POLICE OFFICER, JACK EDWARD TRAVIS.
EARLY PAROLES ON
THE WORK-FURLOUGH PROGRAM.
EMPLOYED BY A COMPANY CALLED
MESA VERDE CONSTRUCTION.
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.
YOU DON'T HAVE A PASS.
- MAY I SEE YOUR PASS?
- MY PASS?
HERE'S MY PASS.
LEO: I GOT SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
ROGER: HE'S WITH US.
- HE'S WITH US?
- I SAID THAT?
WHERE'D YOU GET HER FROM?
RIGGS: WHY AREN'T YOU IN THE HOSPITAL?
DON'T MENTION THE HOSPITAL.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO LEAVE ME THERE.
THEY TRIED TO TAKE MY APPENDIX OUT.
LEO: THEY GAVE ME A LAPOTOMY.
- BRAIN SURGERY?
- A LAPOTOMY.
NOT A LOBOTOMY.
CUT YOUR HAIR SO YOU CAN HEAR.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
THE DIFFERENCE IS, FOR A LAPOTOMY,
THEY SHAVE YOUR NETHER REGIONS.
NETHER WHAT?
NETHER... I CAN'T SAY IT IN FRONT OF HER.
POINT TO IT.
- HERE.
- IT MUST BE ITCHY.
IT IS ITCHY. THESE DOCTORS ARE SAVAGES.
WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT A GUNSHOT WOUND
REQUIRES A RECTAL EXAM?
LEO: HUH? HUH?
YEAH. WITH A TELESCOPE
BIG ENOUGH TO SEE VENUS.
I GUESS ALL THEY SAW WAS URANUS.
THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU.
LEO: YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY?
THEY FUCK YOU IN THE HOSPITAL.
FIRST THEY DRUG YOU, THEN THEY FUCK YOU!
WHEN THEY'RE DONE...
...THE INSURANCE COMPANY COMES
AND FUCKS YOU SOME MORE!
$10 FOR A FUCKING ASPIRIN
AND IT ISN'T EVEN COVERED!
THAT'S ENOUGH!
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK HERE.
SO, WHAT'S NEW ON OUR CASE?
ANYTHING NEW? YOU GOT TRAVIS YET?
DID YOU GUYS ADVERTISE?
- HE'S FAMILY.
- WHO'S SHE?
- SERGEANT COLE.
- HOW ARE YOU? LEO GETZ.
ANYTHING YOU NEED, LEO GETS. GET IT?
- I GET IT.
- IT'S REAL ESTATE, NOW...
LISTEN, COME ON, YOU GUYS,
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I OWE THIS GUY ONE.
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO.
YOU CAN GET US A CUP OF COFFEE.
THAT'S GREAT. I TAKE ONE FOR YOU
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU TELL ME?
RIGGS: HE COULD CHECK THIS OUT.
LEO: THAT'S ALL I'M GOOD FOR?
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO.
CHECK OUT MESA VERDE CONSTRUCTION.
FIND OUT ALL THE INFORMATION YOU CAN.
- SURE, I CAN DO THIS.
- CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT NAME?
MESA VERDE, I GOT IT.
WAIT, WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IF THERE'S ANY SHIT THERE, HE'LL FIND IT.
LORNA: WHO IS THAT GUY?
RIGGS: IT'S A LONG STORY.
HERE ARE YOUR KEYS, CAPTAIN.
YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
- DON'T BE STUPID.
- WHAT THE FUCK?
TAKE THE ELEVATOR, GET THE OTHER GUYS.
KEYS. GIVE ME THOSE FUCKING HANDS.
GODDAMN YOU, TRAVIS. FUCK.
STAND THERE.
I CAN GET FASTER RESULTS THAN
THAT REAL ESTATE BROKER.
RIGGS: LEO'S NOT JUST A REAL ESTATE BROKER.
ROGER: HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS
WITH A LOT OF CONNECTIONS.
JACK: THIS IS WHAT WE CAME FOR.
LOAD EVERYTHING ON THE ELEVATOR.
- HOW'D YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND THEM?
- WE GOT IT ALL, JACK.
THE WORLD OF COMPUTERS, MURPH...
YOU USED TO BE ONE OF US, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
YOU KNOW WHAT FUTURE A COP HAS? NONE.
PUNCH A CLOCK FOR 30 YEARS. RETIREMENT.
PENSION.
NOTHING TO DO.
DRUNK AT NOON, BULLET IN THE BRAIN
BY EVENING. NOT FOR THIS KID.
POLICE DEPARTMENT'S GOT IT ALL:
GUNS, AMMO, DRUGS, CASH.
IT'S A ONE-STOP SHOPPING CENTER
IF YOU GOT THE BALLS AND THE BRAINS.
NOT A THING ANYBODY CAN DO ABOUT IT.
YOU'RE ALREADY FUCKING HISTORY
AND YOU KNOW IT.
SORRY. I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.
SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE.
THE PROGRAM'S BEEN ACCESSED
BY SOMEBODY FROM THE OUTSIDE.
WHAT'S BEEN ACCESSED?
AFTER THE GUNS WERE STOLEN, INTERNAL AFFAIRS
MOVED THE CONFISCATED AMMUNITION.
ARMOR-PIERCING BULLETS?
THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS
TO A MORE SECURE LOCATION.
- THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN ACCESSED.
- SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS.
WHERE'S THIS STORE? WHERE'D THEY MOVE IT?
LORNA: LET'S GO.
LORNA: I'M NOT CUT OUT FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
RIGGS: THAT'S A SWITCH.
LORNA: RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING.
RIGGS: WHERE?
LORNA: I'M SHOWING YOU.
COP: SOMETHING GOING DOWN?
RIGGS: NOTHING'S GOING DOWN.
COP: I'M GOING WITH YOU.
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?
- TWENTY-TWO TODAY.
COME ON.
HAVE YOU GOT PROTECTION?
- RIGHT HERE IN MY WALLET.
- NO, YOUR VEST, YOU DUMMY!
SHOULD WE TAKE HIM?
- OKAY, BUT KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.
- STAY BEHIND ME.
RIGGS: COME ON, LET'S GO. QUIET!
[DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC, BACKGROUND]
JACK: YOU WERE MY TICKET IN.
JACK: IT'S TOO BAD
YOU WON'T BE COMING WITH ME.
LORNA: THEY GOT IT ALL.
RIGGS: HE'S DEAD.
LORNA: HOW'D THEY GET IT OUT OF HERE?
ROGER: I DON'T KNOW.
RIGGS: NOT UPSTAIRS.
ROGER: ELEVATOR!

ROGER: HOW MANY MEN
DO YOU THINK HE HAS?
RIGGS: WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE I SHOULD RUN OVER THERE
AND ASK HIM?
THAT'D BE TOO EASY.
RIGGS: WISH I HAD SOME GRENADES
OR A ROCKET LAUNCHER.
MAYBE A GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILE.
RIGGS: I WONDER WHAT MURPHY'S GOT
IN HIS TRUNK.
IT'S OBVIOUS, MURPHY WAS NEVER
A BOY SCOUT.
NOT EVEN A GOOD SPARE.

RIANNE CAN'T BE PREGNANT.
SHE'S NOT MARRIED.
I DON'T THINK SHE INTENDED TO GET THAT WAY.
THEY ASKING ME TO BE A GRANDDADDY?
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO.
TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF!
WHAT FOR?
OKAY, YOU RUN.
FLAME-O SEES YOU IN YOUR UNDIES.
IT DISTRACTS HIM, THEN I SHOOT.
-SHOOT WHAT?
-THE VALVE ON THAT NAPALM TANK!
BEFORE HE SHOOTS ME?
-MAYBE.
-MAYBE?!
IS HE BLACK?
TOO MUCH ARMOR ON.
I CAN'T TELL!
NO! NOT HIM!
THE FATHER OF THE BABY!
PLEASE LET HIM BE BLACK!
GET GOING! HERE HE COMES!
ARE THOSE HEARTS?
NOT NOW, RIGGS.
JUST HIT THE DAMN VALVE!
ALSO, FLAP AND MAKE NOISES LIKE A BIRD.
FLAP MY ARMS? WHY?
IT'LL DISTRACT HIM MORE.
I NEED HIM TO TURN.
-ON 2!
-WE ALWAYS GO ON 3.
NO TIME FOR 3. 2!
-WHAT ABOUT 1?
-OKAY. 1, 2, GO!
I DON'T WANT TO DIE IN MY UNDERWEAR!
WHY ARE YOU WAITING?
SHOOT THE BASTARD!
RIGGS, YOU THINK THAT BIRD THING HELPED?
I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU'D DO IT.
CUTE SHORTS.
GO SPIT!
I'LL BUY YOU A DOUGHNUT.
DON'T HUG ME WHEN I'M NAKED.
YOU'RE ASHAMED OF YOUR BUTT?
HE'S A LIVELY ONE.
THAT SHARK HURTS MY BOAT,
I TAKE IT OUT ON YOU, LEO.
-I DIDN'T MEAN TO CATCH IT.
-WHY DO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT?
YEAH, WHY KEEP A SHARK?
THE TEETH'LL LOOK GREAT ON A WALL.
THEY GOT TO STOP SNAPPING FIRST.
MAYBE HE'LL FALL ASLEEP.
CONVERSE WITH HIM.
HE'LL NOD OFF.
-HE DON'T LOOK TIRED.
-CHEWING ON LEO WILL WEAR HIM OUT.
SHARKS EAT THEIR OWN KIND?
STOP IT!
I'M IN STITCHES!
OKAY, WHERE'S MY BAG?
STARBOARD SIDE AFT.
STARBOARD, THAT'S LEFT, RIGHT?
NO, PORT'S LEFT.
STARBOARD'S RIGHT.
RIGHT, YEAH. RIGHT SIDE AFT.
GOT IT!
-WHATEVER.
-CHECK BOTH SIDES.
CAREFUL!
HE'S BEHIND YOU, SHARK!
MAYBE WE SHOULD THROW HIM OVERBOARD.
THROW THEM BOTH OVERBOARD.
NO WITNESSES.
WE'D PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH IT.
YOU TOO?
I KEPT MY NOSE OUT OF IT...
...BUT YOU AND LORNA.
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY,
YOU'RE LIVING TOGETHER.
YOU'RE NOT MARRYING.
WHY, DOES THAT VIOLATE YOUR
FAMILY VALUES SYSTEM?
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
RIANNE'S NOT MARRIED EITHER.
THAT'S HITTING BELOW THE BELT.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS MARRIED...
...IT WAS GOOD. YOU KNOW.
YOU PUT THE RING ON.
YOU MAKE THE COMMITMENT.
YOU DO ALL THE....
SHE'S DEAD BECAUSE I'M A COP.
SHE'S DEAD BECAUSE I'M A COP AND I...
I DON'T WEAR THE RING ANYMORE...
...BUT I LOOK, AND IT'S STILL THERE.
I STILL FEEL IT.
IT'S LIKE I'M NOT FINISHED WITH THAT YET.
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
IS THAT BULLSHIT?
NO. IT'S NOT FINISHED.
IT'S NOT FINISHED.
OKAY, YOU DID SAY "AFT"?
A-F-T. AFT!
THAT'S A FUCKING WORD?
IN THE BACK ON THE RIGHT SIDE, LEO!
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT
TO BEGIN WITH, ROGER?!
PEOPLE GET AROUND BOATS AND WATER,
EVERYTHING BECOMES NAUTICAL!
"ASTERN! AVAST, YOU LANDLUBBERS!
MAN THE BILGE PUMP!"
PUMP YOUR FUCKING ASS!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM!
WHAT'S LORNA SAY ABOUT IT?
SHE DOESN'T LIKE NAUTICAL TERMS EITHER.
WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT.
THAT'S PRETTY MESSED UP.
THE BABY'S DUE IN DAYS AND YOU
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT MARRYING?
NO.
I HAVEN'T DONE IT AT ALL.
DO WE WANT LEO TO SHOOT THE SHARK?
I WANT LEO TO SHOOT...
NO, LEO!
WHAT?!
-WHAT'S THE DEAL?!
-YOU'RE SHOOTING A GUN ON MY BOAT!
I'M NOT SHOOTING YOUR BOAT,
I'M SHOOTING JAWS.
NOBODY'S KILLING IT
JUST TO HAVE ITS TEETH!
YOU'RE GRUMPY SINCE YOU
LEARNED YOU'LL BE A GRANDPA.
GET OFF OF ME, WILL YOU?
DON'T FOOL AROUND!
SOME PIECE OF HARDWARE!
GOT A PERMIT?
OF COURSE!
I'M A P.I. NOW.
A GUMSHOE! YOU GET IN
UGLY SITUATIONS. I GOT GUNS!
YOU ARE AN UGLY SITUATION.
YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS.
YOU'RE NOT SAFE.
SMART MOVE, RIGGS.
SHIT!
HARD RIGHT!
YOU HEAR SHOTS?
COAST GUARD, THIS IS CODE 7.
WE'RE IN L.A. HARBOR.
WE GOT AN 07.
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!
WHO WAS IT? DO WE KNOW?
NO, NO, I'LL DRIVE!
-WANT ME TO HELP?
-GET OUT OF HERE!
THIS YOUR GUN?
YEAH, WANT LASER SURGERY?
YOU COULD BLIND SOMEBODY!
COAST GUARD, THIS IS CODE 7,
IN PURSUIT OF FREIGHTER.
HEADING NORTH.
AWAITING INSTRUCTIONS. OVER.
CODE 7,

WE HAVE A CUTTER EN ROUTE.
WHY YOU SLOWING DOWN?

GET ME UP THERE!
HELL OF A FISHING TRIP!
SHUT UP AND KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN!
LAPD!
STOP WHERE YOU ARE!
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!
HE'S GOT IT! HE'S GOT IT!
WHAT'D HE SAY?
WATCH HIS BACK!
YOU DIDN'T SAY YOU'D SHOOT!
TIE IT UP!
PULL IT UP!
GREAT!
I SAID KEEP THE BOAT CLOSER!
WHY LISTEN TO LEO?
SHIT!
YOU ALL RIGHT, RIGGS?!
LOOK!
SHIT!
JUMP! JUMP!
WHERE ARE YOU?

-THE SHARK.
-WHAT ABOUT THE SHARK?
SHARK!
DON'T LEAVE ME!
COME ON!
-HURRY UP!
-I'M COMING!
YOU'LL MAKE IT!
THIS IS ALL I GOT LEFT.
FOUR SETS OF PAPERS, TOTALLY GENUINE.
THEY'LL GET IN THE COUNTRY
AND CAN STAY FOREVER.
U.S. CITIZENS.
ASK THEM TO VOTE THE INCUMBENT PARTY.
HELP ME KEEP MY STATE DEPARTMENT JOB.
BLOODY MARVELOUS!
THEY RED-FLAG ASIAN VISAS.
THOSE WERE HARD TO SLIP THROUGH.
THE SHIP'S BEEN IMPOUNDED.
WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILY?
WE DON'T KNOW YET.
DON'T WORRY. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
SOMETHING WRONG?
A SMALL DELIVERY PROBLEM, MR. PROODY.
GOODBYE.
LEAVE!
I'LL FIND THEM.
NOW.
COAST GUARD INTERDICTS
ABOUT ONE A MONTH.
PRETTY RAGGEDY-LOOKING.
SIX WEEKS LOCKED IN A HOLE
WITH ONE TOILET.
RICE AND SOME FISH TO EAT.
LOUSY DEAL FOR 35 GRAND A HEAD.
WHERE'D THEY GET THAT KIND OF MONEY?
DIDN'T. GOT TO WORK IT OFF FROM
THE SNAKEHEADS, THE SMUGGLERS.
-THEY SELL THEM AS CHEAP LABOR.
-SELL THEM?
LIKE SLAVES.
THESE MUST BE THE LUCKY ONES.
THEY'LL CLAIM ASYLUM. SAY THEY WERE
PERSECUTED, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
WE'LL SEND THEM PACKING.
COST YOU AND ME A FORTUNE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO,
"BRING ME YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR...
...YOUR WRETCHED MASSES,
YEARNING TO BE FREE"?
NOW IT READS, "NO VACANCIES. "
I GUESS YOUR PARENTS
WERE NATIVE AMERICANS.
THEY POP ONE EVERY BOATLOAD.
SHOWS THE REST WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF THEY RUN OFF.
HE'S NOBODY'S SLAVE NOW.
DON'T CODDLE THEM, MOVE THEM!
I SEE THIS BARREL COMING DOWN.
MURTAUGH DIDN'T SEE IT,
SO I PUSH HIM.
I KNOCK HIM OVER.
WE'RE IN THE WATER.
I PULL BECAUSE HE CAN'T SWIM.
I GOT TO SAVE HIM.
THERE'S THAT KID.
WHAT'S HIS NAME? BISSEL?
-IT'S A FOOD.
-BURGER!
NO, BISCUITS OR SOMETHING.
HE ALWAYS KISSES MY ASS,
GIVES ME COFFEE AND SHIT.
SERGEANT RIGGS, SERGEANT MURTAUGH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-THAT'S A LONG STORY.
-YOU'RE ALL WET!
-YOU NEED A BLANKET?
-I'M FINE.
-SOMEBODY GET THIS MAN A BLANKET NOW!
-YES, SIR!
-GET THIS BODY OUT OF HERE.
-WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?
STEP BACK, STEP BACK.
SHIT!
HE'S DEAD.
HE'S FUCKING DEAD!
-SHIT!
-WHAT?
THIS IS HOW HE WANTED
TO COME TO AMERICA?
WAS HE IN THE KILLING SECTION?
THIS GUY'S BEEN SHOT FOUR TIMES!
AT CLOSE RANGE, LIKE HE WAS EXECUTED!
HE WAS EXECUTED.
BY THE CREW.
PEOPLE GET KILLED LEFT, RIGHT
AND CENTER IN THIS TOWN!
NOW WE IMPORT VICTIMS?
GANGBANGERS KILL EACH OTHER,
NO PROBLEM!
ONE OF US GETS SHOT,
OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD!
BUT JUST A NORMAL GUY?
WHAT DID HE EVER DO TO ANYBODY?!
-THAT AIN'T RIGHT.
-EASY, BISCUITS.
YOU'LL GET AN ULCER.
SETTLE DOWN.
BLANKET!
SORRY, BLANKETS.
SORRY, I'M LOSING MY HEAD.
I HATE TO SEE BAD THINGS
HAPPEN TO GOOD FOLK.
WE'D STICK AROUND, BUTLER,
BUT YOU'RE IN CHARGE SO...
YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS, IT'S FREE.
YOU'RE ALL WET.
-GET SOME VAPOR RUB ON YOUR CHEST.
-ALL RIGHT, BOOGERS.
HEY, GET THEM OUT OF HERE!
GET THEM OUT OF HERE!
HE TAKES THE JOB KIND OF PERSONALLY.
YEAH, HE'S PRETTY SERIOUS, I'D SAY.
OVERZEALOUS.
JEALOUS OF WHO?
-I DON'T KNOW. WHO?
-YOU SAID HE WAS JEALOUS.
YOU JUST SAID...
I SAID HE WAS ZEALOUS.
FULL OF ZEAL.
HE'S LOUD TOO.
-HE'S LOUD!
-WHAT?
WE BETTER GET UP
BEFORE THE SUN'S UP.
I GOT SOMETHING IN THE LIFEBOAT.
THAT'S OKAY,
I'LL CATCH A SQUAD RIDE.
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR BOAT.
-I'M SORRY.
-SHIT!
SUDDENLY, A BIG FUCKING SHARK COMES...
CAN I SAY THAT?
YOU CAN SAY IT, BUT WE CAN'T AIR IT.
SO THIS BIG DARN SHARK COMES ALONG....
MY CODE 7.
-YOU WERE COMING HOME LAST NIGHT.
-I'M SORRY.
I HAD SOME BAD CHINESE.
YOU LOOK A LITTLE BANGED UP.
YOU LOOK A LITTLE KNOCKED UP.
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU SURE?
EASY, TIGER!
THERE HE GOES AGAIN.
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN.
YOU OKAY?
I'M BETTER THAN ROGER.
HIS BOAT SANK.
-BOAT SANK?
-I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
NO! NO GREASE!
-HAVE SOME COOKIES.
-WHAT HAPPENED?
GUNFIGHTS, EXPLOSIONS, SHARKS.
THE USUAL.
HERE, BOY.
THANKS.
YOU WERE FISHING.
DOES TROUBLE GO LOOKING FOR YOU?
IT SEEMS TO KNOW PRETTY MUCH
WHERE I AM MOST OF THE TIME.
YOU FINISHED THE NURSERY.
YEAH, I DID.
IT'S GOOD FOR A GIRL OR BOY.
CUTE, HUH?
IT'S A DOGFEST!
DID YOU GET THE WHOLE 1 01 ?
I KNOW. I GOT A LITTLE
CARRIED AWAY WITH PUPPIES.
KID'LL PROBABLY HATE DOGS.
YOU KNOW, LORNA, WE NEVER
EVER TALKED ABOUT MARRIAGE.
I FIGURED YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT.
YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?
WELL, NO.
ME NEITHER.
BREAKFAST?
SERVE AND PROTECT.
SINCE WHEN DO YOU READ THIS SMUT?
IT'S NOT SMUT, IT'S EBONY CLARK.
TRISH GAVE IT TO ME.
"EVERY FIBER IN HIS BEING
DESIRED HER.
HE DEVOURED HER WITH HIS EYES. "
CAN WE TRY THIS THING
ON PAGE 1 96 SOMETIME?
THERE'S A GOOD ONE ON 1 68.
MAYBE LATER.
NOTHING COMES BETWEEN
A PREGNANT LADY AND A MEAL.
HAVE I EVER
"MADE YOUR WOMANHOOD REACH PEAKS...
...TO RIVAL THE HIMALAYAS"?
-FOOTHILLS OF MALIBU, MAYBE.
-NOT EVEN A TETON?
-I DON'T THINK SO.
-THANKS.
I THOUGHT I'D AT LEAST
RATE THE ROCKIES.
YOU KNOW I'M KIDDING.
-YOU SAY THAT TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
-NO, I DON'T.
YOU KNOW I'M PLAYING.
I'VE BEEN TO PLENTY OF
MOUNTAINTOPS WITH YOU.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M HUNGRY.
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KID,
WE'LL BLOW UP MOUNT SAINT HELENS.
-I BROUGHT YOU A DOUGHNUT.
-POLICE FOOD!
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
I DROPPED BY LNTERNAL AFFAIRS YESTERDAY.
HOW'S THE RAT SQUAD?
-I PICKED UP SOMETHING GOOD.
-SOME CHEESE?
I.A. GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP.
THE PERSON SAID ROGER'S ON THE TAKE.
NO, HE'S NOT.
I KNOW! IT'S PROBABLY
SOME JERK HE PUT AWAY.
BUT WITH NEW BOATS
AND PUTTING 2 KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE...
...I THOUGHT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.
I ACTUALLY TRIED TO
PERSUADE HIM TO TAKE MONEY.
STOP IT, RIGGS!
I CAN'T HEAR THAT! NOTHING!
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING ANYMORE.
I'M KIDDING.
-THAT'S AWFUL.
-I'M KIDDING.
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID IT.
WITH HIS PROBLEMS...
...HE'LL BLOW HIS TOP.
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE WHAT?
-IN GENERAL, PROBLEMS.
-YOU MEAN SOMETHING SPECIFIC.
I GOT A NOSE FOR THESE THINGS. WHAT?
YOU'RE PUSHING ME.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO THERE.
GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.
I WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE
TILL YOU TELL ME.
TELL ME.
I'LL TELL YOU!
PREGNANCY DESTROYED MY BRAIN CELLS!
WHAT? WHAT?
I'M DROOLING. WHAT?
PROMISE ME YOU'LL NEVER
SAY A WORD ABOUT THIS EVER.
-I SWEAR, I SWEAR.
-RIGHT HAND!
I SWEAR I WON'T, EVER.
I PROMISE. WHAT?
YOU KNOW HOW ROGER IS
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER DATING COPS.
HE'D KILL THEM. SO?
RIANNE MARRIED ONE, HER BABY'S FATHER.
SHE'S AFRAID TO TELL ROGER.
THEY MET, FELL IN LOVE.
SHE GOT PREGNANT, THEY GOT HITCHED.
NOBODY'S TELLING ROGER?
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN.
IT'S A PACKAGE DEAL?
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT?
-DOES TRISH KNOW?
-SHE KNOWS.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU KNOW.
BUT TRISH KNOWS.
WHO'S THE LUCKY SOON-TO-BE-DEAD
SON-IN-LAW?
-WHO?
-SERGEANT LEE BUTTERS.
THIS JUST GETS BETTER!
NO WONDER HE SUCKS UP TO ROG.
BRINGS HIM APPLES,
BLANKETS, COFFEE....
NOT A WORD.
I'M TELLING YOU, NOTHING!
I WON'T TELL. HE'D SHOOT ME
JUST FOR BEING THE MESSENGER.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. IT'D BE WRONG
TO MESS WITH HIM. I WON'T.
PROMISE.
WE DON'T HAVE TO DISCUSS BOYS' NAMES.
WE'RE HAVING A GIRL.
OKAY. PIADORA.
I LIKE PIADORA. THAT'S SWEET.
I LOVE THAT NAME.
WE'RE TALKING KIDS' NAMES.
HAS RIANNE PICKED ANY OUT?
WE DON'T WANT TO DOUBLE UP.
OSCAR FOR THE BOY,
LOREEN IF IT'S A GIRL.
I LIKE LEE BUTTER.
BETTER! I LIKE IT BETTER.
-DON'T GET ME STARTED.
-I LIKE THOSE NAMES.
CAPTAIN WANTS TO SEE US.
TRISH'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
HAVE FUN SHOPPING FOR THE BABY.
BYE-BYE, HONEY.
WHO HAD THE SLEEPOVER?
JUST AIRING OUT CAMPING GEAR.
-WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
-SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD.
REALLY GOOD!
TRISH HAS FOOD ON THE STOVE.
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
THAT SMELLS LIKE CHINESE FOOD.
CHINESE FOOD?
SHE'S INTO CHINESE COOKING.
I GOT TO TASTE THIS.
-I LOVE CHINESE FOOD.
-HOLD IT! PLEASE!
PLEASE!
THERE'S A CHINESE PERSON IN THE KITCHEN.
I SAW HIM.
A COUPLE OF CHINESE PEOPLE.
ACTUALLY A WHOLE FAMILY.
LARGE FAMILY.
HEY, GUYS!
-IT DOES SMELL GOOD.
-GREAT!
THEY HID IN THE LIFEBOAT.
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.
-SO YOU BROUGHT THEM HOME.
-IT TOOK TWO TRIPS.
-REALLY?
-THEY FIT IN THE STATION WAGON?
THAT'S PING WITH HIS GRANDFATHER, HONG.
HE'S HEAD OF THE FAMILY.
SPEAKS ENGLISH.
HONG, THIS IS MY PARTNER,
MARTIN RIGGS, AND LORNA.
WIFE?
CAN WE SPEAK?
LORNA, THIS IS THE BEST BREAKFAST.
I'M HUNGRY. I'D LOVE SOME.
THIS IS ILLEGAL.
AS IN, "AGAINST THE LAW".
YOU'LL BRING A SHITSTORM
DOWN ON YOU.
JUST HOLD ON!
JUST WAIT A FRIGGING MINUTE!
THE WAY I SEE IT,
THOSE ARE SLAVE SHIPS OUT THERE.
AND I'M FREEING SLAVES...
...IIKE NO ONE DID FOR MY ANCESTORS.
IT'S MY CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING
AND DO IT RIGHT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?
THIS WON'T BE BORING.
NEED ANY HELP?
WHERE IS HE?
WHAT THIS TIME,
FOOD OR MONEY?
-FOOD AND MONEY.
-MONEY.
I SEE YOU MORE
THAN WHEN YOU LIVED HERE.
WE'RE INDEPENDENT NOW.
WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?
-HOOKERS, DRUGS...
-CONTRACEPTIVES.
CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW
THEY TALK TO ME?
IT COSTS MORE TO GO TO SCHOOL NOW.
I GET THE TUITION BILLS.
AND THE GRADES TOO!
THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT
ON A FUTURE ASS-CHEWING.
GET OUT AND GO TO SCHOOL.
I SEE THE TUITION.
I WANT TO SEE SOME GRADES!
I WANT MORE CLUCK FOR MY BUCK.
THANKS FOR THE MONEY.
I'M TIRED.
ME, I CAN'T WIN.
BOY!
DID WE GET A RAISE
AND NOBODY TOLD ME?
I GOT TO GET TO THE BANK.
HOW CAN YOU WHEN YOU'RE TAKEN
TO THE CLEANERS ALL THE TIME?
HEY, GUYS.
HEY, TRISH!
-BOTH THE KIDS LEAVE?
-YES. AND WE'RE BROKE.
IS LORNA HERE?
SHE'S IN THE KITCHEN,
ON HER THIRD BREAKFAST.
I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS.
-I'M SORRY!
-I LOVE IT WHEN YOU DO THAT.
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.
WAIT TILL SHE TRIES RAISING
THAT BABY BY HERSELF.
I'LL BE FINE.
MOVE BACK IN AND GRANDPA'LL
BE UP NIGHTS WITH THE BABY.
BETTER THAN HER
MARRYING THE WRONG GUY.
A COP OR SOMETHING.
TRUE.
COME ON, GUYS.
SEE YOU.
I SHOULD SAY GOODBYE.
HURRY UP!
STUFFING YOUR FACE!
STOP KISSING ME.
TRY THAT.
STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRL.
I'M NOT JOKING.
STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRL.
-JOKING!
-GOT THE BABY BEEPER?
-I KNOW.
-IT'S YOUR FAULT.
IT'S YOUR FAULT.
ALL THE CHICKEN SHIT.
FLAPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY!
IT'S BEEN A YEAR ALMOST.
THIS SHIT AIN'T FUNNY NO MORE!
-ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
-PLEASE! ENOUGH!
I'M THE ONE THAT GETS IT IN THE NECK.
CAN WE EXERCISE MATURITY?
IF I FIND WHO'S DOING THIS,
I'LL KICK HIS ASS.
I CATCH THAT ASSHOLE WHO
PUT MY PICTURE UP, THAT'S IT!
-CUT THEIR BALLS OFF.
-CAPTAIN.
I LOOK OUT EXPECTING
TO SEE ALL THE OLD FACES.
INSTEAD, I SEE KIDS
WHOSE NAMES I BARELY REMEMBER.
WILL YOU SIT DOWN?
WE'RE DINOSAURS HEADED FOR EXTINCTION.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
WE'RE MAKING WAY FOR THE NEW POLICE:
GUYS WITH GUNS AND PSYCHOLOGY DEGREES,
LIKE BUTTERS OUT THERE.
BITER HAS A PSYCHOLOGY DEGREE?
-MORE LIKE A PSYCHO DEGREE.
-TIMES HAVE GOT TO CHANGE.
I ONCE GOT SHOT BY A HOT-RODDER
WITH A ZIP GUN.
THAT'S HOW FAR BACK I GO.
YOU WANTED TO SEE US?
SOME THINGS DON'T CHANGE.
-HERE WE GO.
-THE DEPARTMENT LOST ITS INSURANCE.
ALL THE DAMAGE YOU'VE DONE,
THEY CAN'T GET A NEW ONE...
...WHILE YOU TWO STILL RUN AROUND.
THEY CAN'T FIRE YOU EITHER.
SO, THEY'RE PROMOTING YOU.
-LIEUTENANT!
-THERE'S NO OPEN LIEUTENANT SPOTS.
SO THE CHIEF USED HIS SPECIAL PRIVILEGE,
MAKING YOU CAPTAINS.
-BETTER.
-CAPTAIN!
TIME WAS WHEN THIS WOULD SEND ME OVER
THE FALLS. I'M GETTING OLD.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
CAPTAIN SHIT!
-HANG OUT.
-TAKE LONG LUNCHES.
YELL, "RIGGS, MURTAUGH,
I'M THE CAPTAIN. "
"CHIEF'S SHITTING BRICKS! "
YOU FINISHED?
CAN YOU STAY OUT OF TROUBLE?
ABSOLUTELY.
-CAPTAIN RIGGS!
-CAPTAIN MURTAUGH!
YOU WANT YOUR BADGES?
LET ME SEE THOSE SERGEANT BADGES.
THROW THEM OVER HERE.
THIS IS THE MOST PAINFUL
EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.
-NOW GET OUT!
-THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
ENOUGH WITH THE "CAPTAIN" SHIT!
GET OUT OF HERE!
AFTER YOU, CAPTAIN, I INSIST!
"O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN! "
-CAPTAINS OUTRAGEOUS!
-NEWS TRAVELS FAST.
GET A BREAK FROM REAL POLICE WORK.
PLAY GOLF, TENNIS....
THEY GOT BROWN RINGS
AROUND THEIR NOSES
NOW THAT YOU'RE CAPTAINS,
COME UP IN THE CHOPPER.
-NOT FOR ME.
-I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK.
-IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, CALL US.
-HE'S DOWN-TO-EARTH.
I'M SORRY.
CAN WE KNOCK THIS OFF?
THIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING.
THE MAN'S GOT FEELINGS, YOU KNOW?
CONGRATULATIONS.
LOOK AT YOU!
CAPTAIN MURTAUGH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS,
BUT YOU REALLY INSPIRE ME.
KEEP IT UP.
HOW'S IT GOING, BURTON?
-IT'S BUTTERS, CAPTAIN.
-I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
-KID REALLY LIKES YOU.
-I WISH HE'D CUT IT OUT.
HE LIKES ME?
LIKES ME?
YOU DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME...
...IIKES ME LIKE THAT?
IT'S THE POLICE,
NOT THE MILITARY.
THE MILLENNIUM'S UPON US.
THE CAPTAIN SAID:
"NEW PEOPLE, NEW DEPARTMENT. "
DR. WOODS?
CAPTAIN RIGGS.
-DON'T RUN.
-I'M IN A RUSH.
-I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
-WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?
RECURRING DREAMS ABOUT FLYING DWARFS?
-OR DID YOU COOK UP SOMETHING NEW?
-I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THAT.
I WANT YOUR ADVICE.
I WAS THINKING OF...
-THINKING?
-MARRIAGE.
MARRIAGE?! THE "M" WORD?
DOES "CONFIDENTIALITY" MEAN ANYTHING?
THAT'S FUNNY.
YOU KNOW WHAT'D HAPPEN?
WE'D GO IN MY OFFICE...
...AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'D TELL ME?
YOU'D TELL ME SOMETHING LIKE, "DOC...
...I WANT TO MARRY MURTAUGH. "
OR YOUR MOTHER.
OR NELSON MANDELA!
NELSON MANDELA?!
SOMETHING TO RIDICULE ME, RIGGS.
SOMETHING TO GET A RISE OUT OF ME.
LISTEN CAREFULLY!
I'M...NOT...STUPID!
AND MY TIME IS RESERVED...
...FOR POLICE OFFICERS WITH
REAL NEEDS AND REAL PROBLEMS.
HAVE YOU GOT THAT?!
-HAVE YOU?!
-ASK ME AGAIN?
NO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T LIKE YOU.
STEPHANIE?
I CAN'T GO OUT WITH YOU.
I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP.
I THINK YOU NEED TO SEE SOMEONE.
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU.
NOT IN THIS DEPARTMENT.
BUT STOP BOTHERING ME!
YOU'RE DISGUSTING!
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE?!
WHAT'S SHAKING?
-CAPTAIN RIGGS.
-CAPTAIN MURTAUGH.
TURN AROUND AND DO THAT.
WE'RE CAPTAINS.
HEARD YOU WERE UP TO YOUR ASS
IN CHINESE.
THE TALLER ONES COME UP TO THE NAVEL.
BIG ENOUGH TO KICK YOUR ASS.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
ONE OF THE SHIP'S CREW SHOT AN ILLEGAL,
APPARENTLY UNDER ORDERS...
...AND WE'D DEARLY LIKE TO KNOW
WHO'S SMUGGLING CHINESE.
WE'RE PRETTY SURE THE BIG BOSS
IS BENNY CHAN.
UNCLE BENNY?
YOU KNOW HIM?
-WHEN HE WAS RUNNING SMACK.
-WE NEVER NAILED HIM.
BENNY'S SLIPPERY.
WHERE'S HE HANG OUT?
HE'S GOT A NIGHTCLUB,
SOME RESTAURANTS.
HE OPERATES MAINLY OUT ON NORTH
BROADWAY. HERE'S THE ADDRESS.
HI, FELLAS.
THERE HE IS.
HEY, BURGER! SUMMERS.
BUTTERS.
WHAT YOU GOT ON THE FREIGHTER HOMICIDE?
I TALKED TO SOME ILLEGALS.
THEY ONLY KNEW THE SHOOTER BY SIGHT.
THE BOAT'S REGISTERED UNDER
A DUMMY CORPORATION OUT OF LNDONESIA.
IT'LL BE A ROUGH ONE TO CRACK,
BUT WE'LL NAIL THEM.
YOU EVER HEAR OF BENNY CHAN?
NO. WHAT KIND OF BAD MAN IS HE?
REAL BAD.
CRIME BOSS IN CHINATOWN.
IF IT'S DIRTY AND CHINESE,
BENNY'S DOING IT.
WHERE DO I FIND HIM?
AT THIS RESTAURANT.
I'M HUNGRY FOR CHINESE.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
WE'RE GOING THERE ANYWAY.
WE'LL DRIVE YOU.
LET ME GET MY JACKET.
-NOT WITH HIM.
-HE'S DOING GOOD.
WE MIGHT NEED BACKUP.
SPEND TIME WITH HIM.
YOU MIGHT LEARN TO LOVE HIM.
LIKE A SON.
IN LAW...
...ENFORCEMENT IT PAYS TO KNOW
YOUR FELLOW OFFICER.
SIR, IT'LL BE AN HONOR
TO SHARE EGG ROLLS WITH YOU.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
SHARE?
BUTTERS, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HATE CRIME
IN A SORT OF PERSONAL WAY.
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT, SIR?
LAST NIGHT I NOTICED YOU WERE
MORE THAN SLIGHTLY MIFFED.
WASN'T HE, ROGER?
ANY PARTICULAR REASON?
ABOUT 1 50,000 OF THEM.
THAT'S HOW MANY BULLETS ZINGED
MY NEIGHBORHOOD GROWING UP.
COULDN'T GO OUTSIDE.
COULDN'T GO NEAR A WINDOW.
LIVED AND ATE ON THE FLOOR,
SLEPT AND WATCHED TV ON THE FLOOR.
I DIDN'T LEARN TO WALK
TILL I WAS 1 0.
SPENT MY FORMATIVE YEARS
NOSE-TO-NOSE WITH THE FAMILY BEAGLE.
WHEN I WORK ON A CRIME,
I AIN'T THINKING ABOUT THE CRIME.
I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT FLOOR
AND IT PISSES ME OFF.
-WE SUPPOSED TO MEET LEO SOMEWHERE?
-NO, WHY?
BECAUSE HE'S FOLLOWING US.
DON'T LOOK.
-WHO'S LEO?
-MAYBE IT'S A COINCIDENCE.
-WHAT DOES HE WANT?
-I DON'T KNOW. LET'S FIND OUT.
-FUCKING ASSHOLE!
-BITE ME!
WHATEVER! WHATEVER!
JERK!
YOU LOOKING FOR US?
-YOU SAW ME?
-YEAH, WE SAW YOU.
WHAT YOU DOING, LEO?
I'M PERFECTING MY TAILING TECHNIQUE
NOW THAT I'M A P.I.
HE'S A PRIVATE EYESORE.
INCONSPICUOUS VEHICLE! I LIKE IT.
RIGGS, WHO'S THE PERP?
-WHAT'D YOU BUST HIM FOR?

YOU PROMISED TO DELIVER THE FAMILY.
THEY'RE NOT AT THE DETENTION CENTER.
THEY MUST HAVE ESCAPED.
THE UNCLE WON'T FINISH UNTIL
HE SEES THEM.
DON'T WORRY, THEY'LL TURN UP.
IN HONG KONG, YOU'D ALREADY BE DEAD.
WHERE'S UNCLE BENNY?
-HE'S NOT HERE.

YES, IT'S A TWO-WAY.
WE HAVE 3 PEOPLE.
THE RESTAURANT'S OVER THERE.

THEY SEE US,
BUT WE CAN'T SEE THEM.
-WHERE'S YOUR GREEN CARD?

IT'LL BE FINE.
THEY'VE REFURBISHED!
I COULDN'T STOP THEM.

IT'S AN EXPENSIVE DOG.
-A BOLSHOI.

SORT OF.
LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENS.
INSTEAD OF GOING LOOKING FOR THE DOG,

IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THEIR DOG.
DOG WAS A REAL RAT, THOUGH.
HE SCRATCHED ME.
BUT I GOT THE JOB DONE.

YOU GET A CALL, THEY CUT YOU OFF.
YOU MAKE A CALL, THEY CUT YOU OFF!
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING?
THEY FUCK YOU WITH CELL PHONES.
THEY LOVE WHEN YOU GET CUT OFF.
YOU KNOW WHY?
WHEN YOU CALL BACK...
...THEY CHARGE YOU FOR THE FIRST
MINUTE AGAIN AT THAT HIGH RATE.
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO CALL BACK...
...BECAUSE THE 3-HOUR BATTERY

IF YOU'RE BEHIND A HILL, IT GOES....
OR YOU GO THROUGH A TUNNEL.
AND THEY KEEP MAKING IT SMALLER!
YOU KNOW WHY?
SO YOU CAN LOSE IT.

A COFFEE STAIN'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT'D BOTHER ME.
LOOK AT THE WAY YOU DRESS.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
I DON'T HAVE NIFTY SUITS LIKE YOU.

WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

WATCH THE ROAD!
I'D GIVE MY RIGHT ARM FOR A SIREN!
WHY'D THEY TAKE THE HONGS?
MAYBE THEY'RE SHAKING THEM DOWN
FOR MORE MONEY.
HONG'S UNCLE PAID ALREADY.
HE GOT IN TOUCH WITH HIS UNCLE.
HE LEFT HIM A MESSAGE.
IT'S HOW THEY KNOW WHERE I LIVE.
THERE'S THE SON OF A BITCH RIGHT THERE!
BASTARDS LEFT US TO BURN!
I WANT TO TALK WITH THEM.
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY GUNS!

PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO
WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY.
JUST DON'T EXPECT ME TO LIKE IT.
I KNOW THIS MUST BE HARD FOR YOU.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME!
I HOPED WE'D GET TOGETHER
FOR THE HOLIDAYS, SAY CHRISTMAS.
WHY SHOULD WE GET TOGETHER
AND SEE EACH OTHER ON CHRISTMAS?
-I'M TRYING TO REACH OUT.

MORE SMUGGLING?
WE WENT THROUGH THAT.
WE'RE GOING THROUGH IT AGAIN.
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.
THESE LOOK VERY INTERESTING.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT.
YOU WON'T SHOOT ME.
-YOU'RE LOUSY COPS.
-WE'RE GOOD COPS.
THIS WILL SETTLE HIM DOWN.
BREATHE, UNCLE BENNY.
BREATHE!

TOO LATE FOR WHAT?
WHY'D YOU CALL HIM MY SON-IN-LAW?
UNCLE BENNY? HE'S TOO OLD.
BUY FOUR FATHERS BACK
AT FOUR FATHERS' STORE.
WHY'S HE TALKING ABOUT HIS ANCESTORS?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY YOU CALL HIM MY SON-IN-LAW?
BECAUSE I AM!
I THOUGHT HE WAS....
NO, I'M....
BLOODY MARVELOUS!
YOUR BABY IS HAVING MY BABY.
MY BABY IS HAVING HIS BABY.
AND YOUR BABY? WHOA, BABY!
WHOA, BABY! MY BABY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I COULDN'T STALL ANYMORE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
ROG, LOOK AT THIS.
DOES THAT HURT?
UNCLE BENNY,

THAT'S TWO FOR BENNY.
BLOODY MARVELOUS!
-ARE YOU CRAZY?
-WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
FOR KEEPING IT FROM ME
AND LETTING ME THINK....
HIT HIM, NOT ME.
AS SOON AS WE FIND THE HONGS,
WE'RE GETTING INTO THIS.
UNCLE.
YOU'RE ALL HERE?
ALL HERE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
AS PAYMENT FOR BRINGING YOU
TO AMERICA...
...YOUR UNCLE'S WORKING FOR US.
NOW FINISH THE JOB.
WHAT JOB?
NO TIME TO TALK NOW.
TAKE THEM TO THEIR NEW HOMES...
...AND GUARANTEE THEIR SAFETY.
THEN I'LL FINISH.
FINISH NOW OR WATCH THE OTHERS DIE.
RIMMINY ?
A YOUNG BIMBO? A JUMPING JIMINY?
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN 'T REMEMBER.
NO, RIGGS. RENMINBI.
SAY THAT AGAIN.
THAT'S IT!
YOU GOT IT.
MEANS, "PEOPLE'S MONEY. "
PEOPLE'S MONEY?
WHAT ELSE DID BENNY SAY?
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
BUYING BACK HIS ANCESTORS.
AND ABOUT HOW TONIGHT'S...
...TOO LATE.
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
NO, NOTHING AT ALL.
AND THE GUY WHO TORCHED MY HOUSE?
BENNY WAS AFRAID OF HIM.
IF BENNY'S SCARED,
HE'S GOT TO BE A CHINESE TRIAD.
THOSE GUYS KILL ANYONE
IN THEIR WAY.
INCLUDING COPS...
...AND THEIR FAMILIES.
WATCH YOUR ASSES!
-THANKS, NG.
-KEEP ME POSTED.
PICK UP YOUR WIFE, MY DAUGHTER.
-I'LL GET TRISH, YOU GET LORNA.
-HER AND PING.
WHAT?
YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED, DON'T YOU?
NO.
YES. YES, I DO.
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, IT'S OKAY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT
ANY PRESSURE ON YOU.
IF YOU WANT TO SOMEDAY, THAT'D BE GREAT.
IF YOU DON'T...
...I LOVE YOU.
I'LL TAKE YOU ANY WAY I CAN GET YOU.
FEEL THAT!
-PING, FEEL THE BABY!
-HE'S REALLY DANCING.

THEY FOUND MY WATCH.
THEY KILLED HONG, HIS UNCLE,
UNCLE BENNY TOO. BODIES ARE IN THERE.
-WHERE'S THE REST OF THE FAMILY?
-THEY'RE OKAY.
INS RAIDED A CHINESE SWEATSHOP.
HONG'S FAMILY WAS BEING HELD THERE
AND THEY LED THEM BACK HERE.
THEY WERE MAKING FUNNY MONEY.
INK'S STILL WET.
-WHERE ARE THE FACES?
-IT'S WHY I CALL IT FUNNY.
WHY ARE THEY MAKING CHINESE MONEY?
CAN THEY EVEN EXCHANGE IT HERE?
-ONLY IN CHINA.
-RENMINBI.
I REMEMBER.
HONG'S UNCLE WAS AN ARTIST.
MAYBE AN ENGRAVER.
BRINGING OVER HIS FAMILY COULD'VE
BEEN HOW HE WAS PAID FOR THE JOB.
-THAT'S THIN.
-IT'S NOT.
KEEP TALKING. WHAT?
BENNY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT PAYING...
...BUYING BACK HIS FOREFATHERS.
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
BENNY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT BUYING
BACK HIS FOREFATHERS.
YOU SAID ANCESTORS.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
THE NUMBER FOUR.
FOUR FATHERS.
THEY WERE THE TOP GUYS
OF THE HONG KONG TRIAD.
THEY DISAPPEARED FROM PRISON.
REDS JAILED THEM WHEN THEY
TOOK OVER HONG KONG.

-WHERE'RE WE GOING?
-L.A. HARBOR.
-WHAT'S THERE?
IT'S A FOREIGN TRADE ZONE.
SHADY DEALS WITH THE CHINESE MILITARY.
IT'S RUN BY A CORRUPT CHINESE GENERAL.
I GOT IT, A CORRUPT CHINESE GENERAL
BROUGHT THE FOUR FATHERS HERE...
...AND THE TRIAD'S
BUYING THEIR RELEASE.
THAT'S WHAT UNCLE BENNY MEANT
BY BUYING THEM BACK.

BINGO.

NOW HE'S REALLY PISSED.
SON OF A BITCH WILL BE A HANDFUL.
SINCE I MET YOU, I'VE DONE SOME
HAIRY SHIT. BUT THIS WON'T HAPPEN.
I'M GOING TO BE A GRANDFATHER...
...AND YOU AND LORNA WILL HAVE A BABY.
HE AIN'T WORTH DYING FOR, RIGGS.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF HE GETS AWAY WE CAN
TRACK HIM DOWN LATER...
...WITH A HOWITZER OR SOMETHING.
YOUR SON-IN-LAW'S BLEEDING.
WE SHOULD GET HIM AND GO.
-SHIT, IT'S RAINING.
-I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT.
GUY'S TOO DAMN GOOD.
HOW'D HE DO THAT THING WITH THE GUN?
HE TOOK MY GUN APART WITH ONE MOVE.
HOW'D HE DO THAT?

YEAH, OKAY.
LET'S GO ASK HIM.

YOU WILLED ME TO IT!
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN?
I WAS KNOCKED DOWN OVER HERE!
I COULDN'T EVEN GET UP!
COME BACK HERE!
LET'S GO HOME, MAN.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE ENOUGH
LATELY, VICKY. I'M SORRY.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT LORNA.
ME AND LORNA.
IT'S LIKE THIS.
SHE WANTS TO GET MARRIED...
...AND I LOVE HER.
I WON'T LIE TO YOU. I DO.
AND I WANT TO MAKE HER HAPPY.
I'M LOOKING FOR HELP HERE, HONEY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
FUNNY TALKING TO YOU ABOUT
THIS STUFF...
YOU WANT TO GET YOURSELF SHOT?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS TAILING YOU.
SORRY.
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.
I GUESS YOU WANT TO BE ALONE.
I'D APPRECIATE IT.
WHEN I WAS A KID I HAD A PET FROG.
WHAT?
GIVE ME A SECOND.
LET ME TELL YOU THIS.
I HAD THIS PET FROG, NAME WAS FROGGY.
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD.
I DIDN'T HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS.
IN FACT...
...I HAD NO FRIENDS.
I USED TO KISS THE FROG TOO.
I THOUGHT MAYBE...
...IT WOULD TURN INTO A PRINCESS
SINCE I WAS A BOY.
AND IT COULD BE...
...MY MOTHER.
THEY TOLD ME THAT
SHE LEFT OR SOMETHING.
AND MY FATHER WAS NO BARGAIN.
AND SO, JUST THE FROG...
...FROGGY, WAS MY FRIEND.
I LOVED HIM AND TOOK HIM
EVERYWHERE WITH ME.
I WAS RIDING MY BIKE ONE DAY...
...HE JUMPED OUT OF THE BOX...
...AND I RAN HIM OVER
WITH THE BACK TIRE.
I KILLED HIM.
I WAS REALLY HEARTBROKEN. REALLY.
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND,
THE ONLY THING I EVER LOVED.
AND THEN I MET YOU...
...AND ROGER.
YOU LOOKED AFTER ME
A LOT MORE THAN YOU HAD TO.
I'M TERRIBLE TO YOU, LEO.
NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE MY FAMILY...
...AND MY FRIENDS.
YOU'RE NOT BETTER FRIENDS THAN FROGGY,
JUST DIFFERENT.
I JUST THOUGHT THAT
MIGHT BE RELEVANT.
OKAY, I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE NOW.
I GOT A FUNNY F...
WHAT'S WRONG?!
I'M HAVING A BABY.
LORNA BEEPED ME.
YES, IT'S LORNA.
SHE'S HAVING THE BABY.
-I'LL GET THE CAR.
-I'LL BE BEHIND YOU.
YOU PICKED A STRANGE ANGEL, HONEY.
BUT I GOT THE MESSAGE.
I GOT THE MESSAGE.
I'LL ALWAYS HAVE THIS.
ALWAYS HAVE YOU.
IN HERE AND HERE.
THANKS, HONEY.
I GOT TO GO. BYE.
I AM NOT READY TO HAVE THIS BABY!
YOU'RE AS READY AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE.
FINE! JUST WHEEL ME IN.
MY LEGS ARE STAYING CLOSED!
GIVE ME THIS!
MA'AM, LET GO!
I AM A POLICE OFFICER!
AND I AM NOT READY!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
-ARE YOU THE HUSBAND?
-YES.
HONEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
NO, I'M NOT.
I SAID I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED, BUT I DO.
I WANT TO BE A WIFE
BEFORE I'M A MOTHER.
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO.
-YOU SAID "OKAY"?
-YES, I DID. OKAY.
LET'S DO IT.
HE SAID OKAY.
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-HE SAID OKAY, LEO.
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE TOILET
AND SHE GRABBED ME.
-I'M SO SORRY.
-HAVE A NICE BABY!
I'M SO SORRY.
WILL YOU MARRY ME?
YOU BET I WILL.
LET'S GO.
I'M NOT GOING! WAIT!
-GET A MINISTER.
-NOW?
NOW. WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE.
WE NEED A LICENSE...
I WANT TO HEAR IT
BEFORE THE BABY COMES!
IT'S COMING NOW.
LISTEN, I AM GETTING MARRIED
OR THERE IS NO BABY.
THIS COULD BE AN ASPECT
OF A TRANSITION PHASE.
THIS IS NO GODDAMN ASPECT
OF A TRANSITION PHASE!
HONEY, EVERYBODY, CALM DOWN.
CALM DOWN. OKAY?
GET A PRIEST, MINISTER, ANYTHING.
GO GET A PRIEST!
GODDAMN IT, LEO!
I GOT IT. OKAY.
PANT, PANT, BLOW.
REMEMBER LAMAZE CLASS?
PANT, BLOW. COME ON!
BUT I WANT TO SAY "I DO. "
HERE HE IS!
THIS IS RABBI GELB.
A RABBI?
YOU SAID ANYTHING.
HE'LL DO.
FOR WHAT I'LL DO?
WE'D LIKE YOU TO MARRY US.
PLEASE.
-YOU'RE JEWISH?
-NOT NECESSARILY.
-YOU GOT A LICENSE?
-NO.
PLEASE DON'T GO!
SHE NEEDS TO HEAR THE WORDS
BEFORE THE BABY COMES.
ARE YOU BOTH SERIOUS?
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR HIJINKS.
WE'RE VERY SERIOUS.
I COULD DO IT.
IT WOULDN'T BE OFFICIAL.
I JUST WANT TO HEAR THE WORDS.
WHAT THE HELL! YOUR NAMES?
I'M MARTIN AND THIS IS LORNA.
MARTIN AND LORNA.
WHAT AM I DOING?
HOW DO THE GOYIM DO THIS?
DEARLY BELOVED!
DEARLY BELOVED,

SHE'S HEADING FOR THE HOME STRETCH.
MARTIN, WILL YOU TAKE
LORNA TO BE YOUR WIFE?
WILL YOU HONOR, LOVE, ETC...
-...TILL DEATH DO YOU PART?
-I WILL.
LORNA, WILL YOU TAKE MARTIN
TO BE YOUR HUSBAND?
-I DO.
-THE SAME THING.
I PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE.
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.
YOU ALREADY DID.
-LET'S GO.
-NO, WAIT!
HOLD IT!
WHAT IS IT?
LET ME HAVE THIS GLASS!
NO, GODDAMN IT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
TALK TO THE HAND!
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME
TO FILL THAT THING? ALL DAY!
THIS IS UNSANITARY.
WHAT IS THIS?
-BREAK THE GLASS.
-I'LL GET PISS ON MY SHOES!
YOU GOT TO DO THIS!
MAZEL TOV !
COME BACK HERE, YOU LITTLE SON OF A BITCH!
PANT, PANT, BLOW.
LEO, PLEASE.
YOUR WORK IS OVER HERE.
I THINK SOMEONE ELSE NEEDS YOU.
GOOD LUCK, LORNA, RIGGS.
THANKS A LOT.
STICK AROUND.
MEET THE KID.
GOOD LUCK, LORNA!
HERE IT COMES.
HERE HE IS.
HE'S LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU.
HE KNOWS IT'S YOU.
ROG, LOOK WHAT I FOUND.
-LOOK AT THAT.
-WHAT A BEAUTY!
LOOK AT THOSE EYES!
-HE LOOKS LIKE HIS MOTHER.
-YES, HE DOES.
MURTAUGH!
NO, BUTTERS!
BUTTERS' BABY.
BETTER NOT BE MURTAUGH.
IT'S BUTTERS.
LOOK AT THAT BABY.
LOOK AT THE HAIR.
THAT'S MY BABY!
LOOK AT HER. YOU'RE SO CUTE.
LOOK AT YOU!
OF BRINGING A CAMERA?
LEO, YOUR PLASTIC'S FLACCID.
THESE MACHINES WRECK YOUR PLASTIC,
THEN GIVE YOU THE CAMERA.
THE CAMERA DOESN'T WORK.
THEY'RE TRYING TO...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
LOOK AT THESE TWO BABIES.
A LITTLE SOMETHING FROM THE SQUAD.
-GIVE BACK THE CAPTAIN BADGES.
-WHY?
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE SERGEANTS AGAIN.
THE CITY'S SELF-INSURED.
I THOUGHT THEY'D MAKE US PRESIDENT.
BY THE WAY, GRANDPA,
YOU OWE THE CHIEF ONE.
HE WENT TO THE INS...
...AND THEY'RE GIVING ASYLUM
TO THE HONGS.
ALL RIGHT!
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A PICTURE.
SQUEEZE TOGETHER.
CANDY STRIPERS OUT.

I CAN'T.
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM.
YOU GOT TO BACK UP.
I'M TAKING BIG STEPS!
GET THIS GUY TO TAKE IT.
DOC, CAN YOU TAKE A PICTURE
OF ALL OF US?
IT'S MY BEST MAN, AFTER ALL.
GET MY GRANDBABY IN IT TOO.
ARE YOU ALL FRIENDS?
NO. WE'RE FAMILY!
OKAY, ON 3.
ONE, TWO, THREE!




                        L E T H A L  W E A P O N

                             BY SHANE BLACK




     FADE IN:

     CITY OF ANGELS

     LIES SPREAD OUT BENEATH US IN ALL ITS  SPLENDOR,  LIKE  A
     BARGAIN BASEMENT PROMISED LAND.

     CAMERA SOARS, DIPS, WINDS ITS WAY SLOWLY  DOWN,  DOWN,
     BRINGING US IN OVER THE CITY AS WE:

     SUPER MAIN TITLES.

     TITLES END, AS WE --

     SPIRAL DOWN TOWARD A LUSH, HIGH-RISE APARTMENT COMPLEX.
     THE MOON REFLECTED IN GLASS.

     CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE IN THROUGH BILLOWING CURTAINS,
     INTO THE INNER SANCTUM OF A  PENTHOUSE  APARTMENT,  AND
     HERE, BOYS AND GIRLS, IS WHERE WE LOSE OUR BREATH,
     BECAUSE --

     SPREAD-EAGLED ON A SUMPTUOUS DESIGNER SOFA LIES THE
     SINGLE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE CITY.
     BLONDE HAIR. A SATIN NIGHTGOWN THAT POSITIVELY  GLOWS.
     SAM COOKE MUSIC, CROONING FROM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR
     SPEAKERS.

     PASTEL COLORS. WINDOW  WALLS.  NEW  WAVE  FURNITURE  TOR-
     TURED INTO WEIRD SHAPES.  IT LOOKS LIKE ROBOTS LIVE HERE.

     ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE SLEEPING VENUS  LIES  AN  OPEN
     BOTTLE OF PILLS ... NEXT TO THAT, A MIRROR DUSTED WITH
     COCAINE.

     SHE ROUSES HERSELF TO SMEAR SOME POWDER  ON  HER  GUMS.
     AS SHE DOES, WE SEE FROM HER EYES THAT SHE IS THOROUGHLY,
     COMPLETELY WHACKED OUT OF HER MIND...

     SHE STANDS, STUMBLES ACROSS THE ROOM, PAUSING TO GLANCE
     AT A PHOTOGRAPH ON THE WALL:

     TWO MEN.  SOLDIERS.  YOUNG, ROUGH-HEWN, ARMS AROUND EACH
     OTHER.

     THE GIRL THROWS OPEN THE GLASS DOORS ... STEPS OUT ONTO A
     BALCONY, AND THERE, BENEATH HER, LIES  ALL  OF  NIGHTTIME
     L.A.  PANORAMIC SPLENDOR.  HER HAIR FLIES, HER EXPRESSION.
     RAPT, AS SHE STANDS AGAINST THIS SEA OF TECHNOLOGY.  SHE
     IS BEAUTIFUL.

     ON THE BALCONY RAILING BESIDE HER  STAND  THREE  POTTED
     PLANTS.

     THE GIRL SEES THEM, PICKS ONE UP.  LOOKS OVER THE BALCONY
     RAILING ... IT IS TEN STORIES DOWN TO THE PARKING LOT.
     SHE SQUINTS, HOLDS THE PLANT OVER THE EDGE.

                         GIRL
               RED CAR.

     DROPS THE PLANT.  DOWN IT GOES, SPIRALLING END OVER END
     -- UNTIL, FINALLY ... BAM --  !  SHATTERS.  DIRT  FLIES.  A
     RED CHEVY IS NOW MINUS A WINDSHIELD.  THE GIRL TAKES
     ANOTHER PLANT.

                         GIRL
               GREEN CAR.

     SHE DROPS IT.  GREEN DODGE.  TEN STORIES BELOW, BAM
     IMPACT CITY.  SCRATCH ONE PAINT JOB.  GRABS THE FINAL
     PLANT AND HOLDS IT OUT, SAYING:

                         GIRL
               BLUE CAR.

     POW.  GLASS SHATTERS.  DIRT SPRAYS.  A BLUE BMW THIS
     TIME.  THE GIRL LOVES THIS GAME ... HER EXPRESSION IS
     SLIGHTLY CRAZED.  SHE REACHES FOR ANOTHER PLANT --
     THERE AREN'T ANY.  HER SMILE FADES -- AND FOR A MOMENT,
     JUST A MOMENT, THE DULLNESS LEAVES HER EYES AND SHE IS
     SUDDENLY, INCREDIBLY SOBER.  AND TEARS FILL HER EYES AS
     SHE LOOKS OVER THE EDGE --

                         GIRL
               YELLOW CAR.

     AND JUMPS THE RAILING. PLUMMETS, HEAD  OVER  HEELS  LIKE  A
     RAG DOLL. HITS THE YELLOW CAR  SPOT  ON.  SHE  LIES,  DEAD,
     LIKE AN EXTINGUISHED DREAM.  STILL BEAUTIFUL.

                                                  CUT TO:

1A   EXT. BENEATH THE PIER    NIGHT                         1A

     FOUR TOUGH-LOOKING DOCK WORKERS ARE CAMPED  OUT  UNDER  THE
     PIER, WARMING THEMSELVES AROUND A SMALL BONFIRE, LAUGHING
     LOUDLY.  CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS DANGLE ABOVE THEM FROM THE
     PIER, AND EMPTY BEER CANS LITTER THE SAND AROUND THEM.

     CAMERA PUSHES IN TO DISCOVER AN OLD COLLIE TIED TO ONE OF
     THE PILINGS. THEN WE REALIZE THAT THE  DOG  IS  BEING  TOR-
     MENTED BY THE DOCK WORKERS.  THEY FLICK LIGHTED MATCHES
     AT HIM.  SHAKE THEIR BEERS AND SPRAY HIM IN THE FACE.
     THESE GUYS ARE NOT ROCKET SCIENTISTS.

     THE DOG COWERS, TUGGING BN THE ROPE.  TRIES  TO  GET  AWAY.
     ALL TO THE GREAT AMUSEMENT OF ITS TORMENTORS.

     ONE OF THEM TURNS, LAUGHING --

     AS A SHADOWY FIGURE STRIDES CALMLY UP TO THE FIRE:
     LONG HAIR.
     CIGARETTE DANGLING FROM-LOWER LIP.
     SHIRT-TAILS HANGING LOOSE BELOW THE WAIST.

     NOTHING THREATENING IN HIS MANNER AS HE PLOPS DOWN  BESIDE
     THE MEN, SMILING.
     THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY ON THEIR GUARD.

                         RIGGS (FIGURE)
               HAPPY HOLIDAYS.  MIND IF I JOIN
               YOU?

                         PUNK  #1
               YES.

                         PUNK  #2
               FUCK OFF.

     RIGGS SMILES AT HIM INNOCENTLY.  STROKES THE COLLIE'S FUR
     WITH ONE HAND.
     WITH THE OTHER, HE REACHES INTB A PAPER SACK AND PRODUCES,
     A SPANKING NEW BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS, POSSIBLY THE FINEST
     DRINK MANKIND HAS  YET  PRODUCED.

                         RIGGS
               I NEED HELP DRINKING THIS.  COOL?

     THE DOCK WORKERS EXCHANGE GLANCES.  THERE SEEMS TO BE NO
     HARM IN THIS.  ONE OF THEM FROWNS:

                         PUNK  #1
               YOU A HOMO?

                         RIGGS
               DO I LOOK LIKE A HOMO?

                         PUNK  #1
               YOU GOT LONG HAIR.  HOMOS GOT LONG
               HAIR.

                         PUNK #3
               I HATE HOMOS.  ARRGGH.

     RIGGS SHAKES HIS HEAD, LAUGHS.

                         RIGGS
               BOY, YOU GUYS ARE TERRIFIC.  YOU
               MAKE ME LAUGH, YOU JUST DO.

     AT WHICH POINT, APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH, PUNK #4 SHAKES A
     BEER AND SPRAYS IT IN THE OLD COLLIE'S FACE.

     THE DOG PULLS  AWAY,  WHINING.
     RIGGS LEANS FORWARD.

                         RIGGS
               THIS YOUR DOG?  NICE DOG.

     AND THEN, HE PROCEEDS TO DO A PECULIAR THING:
     HE STARTS TO TALK TO THE DOG --
     IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE DOG'S OWN LANGUAGE.
     VERY WEIRD, FOLKS...
     HE COOS, SNUFFLES, BARKS SOFTLY, THEN WITHDRAWS,
     LISTENING, HIS EAR TO THE DOG'S MUZZLE.
     RIGGS NODS.  FROWNS.
     THE OTHERS LOOK  ON,  PUZZLED.
     THEN RIGGS LOOKS AT EACH OF THE FOUR DOCK WORKERS.

                         RIGGS
               HUH-  YOU KNOW WHAT?  HE SAYS HE
               DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SPRAY BEER IN
               HIS FACE.  HE SAYS HE JUST HATES
               THAT.

     A PAUSE.  UNCOMFORTABLE.  THEN --

                         PUNK #1
               OH, HE DOES ... ?
                    (BEAT)
               WELL, MISTER, WHY DON'T YOU ASK
               HIM WHAT HE LIKES...?

     THE OTHERS SNICKER.  RIGGS SIMPLY NODS.

                         RIGGS
               OKAY.

     AND ONCE AGAIN, BEGINS TO CONFER WITH THE DOG.  LISTENS
     INTENTLY, PIECING TOGETHER WHAT HE IS HEARING.

                         RIGGS
               WHAT ... ? YOU WANT ...  OH.  OH,
               HELL NO, I COULDN'T DO  THAT  ...
               NOSSIRREE BOB,  YOU  LITTLE  NUT.

     HE RUFFLES THE DOG'S HAIR.
     THE MEN ARE MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER AS RIGGS TURNS AND
     SAYS:

                         RIGGS
                    (CHUCKLING)
               GET THIS: HE WANTS  ME  TO  BEAT
               THE SHIT OUT OF YOU GUYS.

     EVERYTHING STOPS.  A CLOUD PASSES OVER THE ASSEMBLED
     FACES AND A  PIN-DROPPING  SILENCE  ENSUES.

     RIGGS, COMPLETELY HEEDLESS, ONCE AGAIN ATTENDS TO THE DOG:

                         RIGGS
               WHAT'S THAT ... ?  THE ONE ... IN THE
               MIDDLE...  'IS A STUPID FAT DUCK'...
               WHAT ... ?
                    (LISTENS AGAIN)
               OH ... OH!  A 'STUPID FAT FUCK!'
               RIGHT.

     HE LOOKS UP, SHAKES HIS HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               BOY, THIS DOG IS PISSED.

     THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE GRABS RIGGS BY THE COLLAR.
     HOISTS HIM TO HIS FEET.  GULP.

     STANDS, STARING DOWN AT RIGGS, WHOSE EYES ARE COMPLETELY
     NEUTRAL, LIKE A SNAKE'S.

                         PUNK #1
               BUDDY, YOU'RE SHORTENING YOUR
               LIFE SPAN.

     HE FLICKS OPEN A MEAN-LOOKING SWITCHBLADE.

     RIGGS IS DEAD MEAT.

     SO WHY THEN, DOES HE CHOOSE THIS MOMENT TO EXECUTE A
     THREE STOOGES' ROUTINE, CONSISTING OF NOSE TWEAK, EYE
     GOUGE, AND ROTATING FIST THAT BOBS THE DOCK WORKER ON
     THE HEAD... ?

     HE'S NUTS OR SOMETHING ...

     RIGGS STEPS BACK AND ADOPTS A NEUTRAL FIGHTING STANCE.
     THE OTHERS BEGIN TO CIRCLE.

     THE DOG BARKS.  RIGGS TURNS TO THE DOG, BUT HIS EYES NEVER
     LEAVE HIS GRINNING ATTACKERS.

                         RIGGS
                    (TO THE COLLIE)
               WHAT'S THAT ... ?  YOU WANT ME TO
               TAKE THE KNIFE AWAY... AND BREAK
               HIS ELBOW... ?

     CIRCLING ...

     RIGGS, WATCHING THEM, HIS EYES BEGINNING TO DANCE ...
     BREATHING SLOW AND EVEN...

                         RIGGS
               BUT THAT WOULD BE EXCRUCIATINGLY
               PAINFUL ...

     SOMETHING INSIDE RIGGS IS GEARING UP ... THE OTHERS CAN
     PERHAPS SENSE IT, THEIR SMILES FALTER A BIT,  THEY  CROUCH,
     COMBAT-READY...
     RIGGS, EYES BLAZING ...

                         RIGGS
               AND IF I SEPARATED THE FAT ONE'S
               SHOULDER... HE'D PROBABLY SCREAM...

     NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.  WE KNOW FROM THE LOOK IN RIGGS' EYES
     HE'S NUTS.  HE WANTS THE FIGHT, BADLY, ALL FOUR OF THEM
     AT ONCE ...

     AND THEN PUNK #1 SPRINGS...
     BIG MISTAKE.

     NEEDLESS TO SAY, MINCEMEAT IS MADE OF THE  FOUR  MEDDLESOME
     DOG-TORTURERS.

     THE BEACH IS LITTERED WITH THEIR WRITHING FORMS AS RIGGS
     DOES, FINALLY, WHAT HE SET OUT TO DO:

     UNTIES THE DOG.

     STARTS TO GO.
     AS HE DOES, HE PATS HIS SHIRT ...

     PATS HIS JEANS ... REALIZES HIS WALLET HAS FLOWN FREE
     DURING THE FRACAS.

     SCOOPS TO RETRIEVE IT FROM ITS RESTING PLACE ON THE  SAND,

     WHERE IT LIES OPEN, AND AS IT LIES OPEN, YES,  FOLKS,  THAT
     IS A BADGE WE SEE.

     RIGGS, WE REALIZE, IS AN OFFICER OF THE LAW.

     HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE AND NOTICES THE COLLIE, SEATED.
     FROWNS:

                         RIGGS
               OKAY, SKEEZIX.  GO ON.  GET OUTTA
               HERE.

     HE BEGINS TO WALK AWAY.  THE DOG REMAINS CLOSE AT HIS
     HEELS.  FOLLOWING HIM.

                        RIGGS
               NO, NO.  DON'T FOLLOW ME.  I'M AN
               ASSHOLE.  GO AWAY.

     THE DOG SITS OBEDIENTLY AND RIGGS WALKS AWAY.
     HE CAN'T HELP IT, LOOKS BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER...

     SEES THE DOG WATCHING HIM WITH A BESEECHING EXPRESSION.
     PITIFUL.

                         RIGGS
               AW, SHIT.

     HE SIGNALS THE DOG.

                         RIGGS
               AWRIGHT.  MOVE IT.  LET'S GO.

     THE COLLIE BARKS HAPPILY AND DASHES TOWARD HIM THROUGH
     THE SURF, KICKING UP SAND AND WATER.

     AS THEY SHUFFLE OFF AGAINST THE PALM-LINED SKYLINE, WE
     HEAR, SUPERED, RIGGS' VOICE.

                         RIGGS (V.O.)
               SO.  YOU LIVE IN THE AREA?  WHAT'S
               YOUR MAJOR ... ?

     AND SO ON AS WE ...

     SEATED IN THE  BATHTUB.  HE  GROANS,  THROWS  A  TOWEL  OVER
     HIMSELF, AND MUTTERS IN MOCK INDIGNATION:  ROGER IS
     TOUGH:  AN OLD-FASHIONED FIGHTER, WEARS HIS PAST LIKE A

     AND IT IS A TYPICAL MORNING FOR DETECTIVE ROGER MURTAUGH.
     CHAOS. THE  TELEVISION  BLARES.  YOUNG  CARRIE  MURTAUGH
     WAILS LIKE A BANSHEE.  HER BROTHER NICK TELLS HER TO
     SHUT UP. TRISH MURTAUGH IS BURNING  EGGS  IN  THE  KITCHEN.
     ROGER MURTAUGH ENTERS THEN, FIXING  HIS  TIE.  THE  FOLLOW-
     ING DIALOGUE IS FAST AND FURIOUS, TOSSED  OVER  THE  SHOUL-
     DER AS MURTAUGH SCURRIES TO AND FRO,  GETTING  DRESSED:

                         MURTAUGH
               HONEY, WHAT'S THIS ON MY TIE?

     SHE  LOOKS.

                         TRISH
               AN  UGLY   SPOT?

                         MURTAUGH

                         TRISH

                         TRISH
               THANKS.  I LOVE YOU, TOO.

     CARRIE IS STILL SHRIEKING.  TEARS STREAM DOWN HER FACE.

               HEY, KID, TURN OFF THE WATERWORKS,

               DEAD BODY IN AN AMBULANCE, SON,

               YOUNG LADY, STOP CRYING OR I'LL
               GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO CRY ABOUT.
               DAMN.

     HE DABS AT HIS TIE.  CARRIE SCREAMS.  IN THE KITCHEN
     TRISH DROPS THE EGGS, SWEARS.  THE PHONE RINGS.  CARRIE
     SCREAMS.

               THAT'S IT.  I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
               SOMETHING TO CRY ABOUT.

     HE GRABS A COPY  OF NEWSWEEK AND HANDS IT TO HER.

     HE EXITS THE KITCHEN, CROSSES THE ENTRANCE HALL.  STOPS,
     NOTICING RICKLES THE CAT, WHO IS HAPPILY MUNCHING ON THE
     REMAINS OF ROGER'S BIRTHDAY CAKE.

                         MURTAUGH

     ADMITTING TWO BEAT COPS AND A YOUNG HOOKER.  HER NAME

17   INT. MURTAUGH'S CAR                                     17

     THE SARGE DRIVES UP AND GETS OUT.  A BEAT COP TOES BY.

     HE CROSSES TO THE TWO COPS AND DIXIE.

                         COP #2
               HEY,  SARGE.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS STUNNED.  HE SPEAKS VERY SLOWLY:

               I KNEW HER  DAD.

               LANDED RIGHT ON TOP OF HER OWN CAR.

                         MURTAUGH
               FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT IT FOR HER.
               HER SUGAR DADDY.

                         COP #2

19   INT. AMANDA LLOYD'S APARTMENT - DAY                          19

     MURTAUGH STARES AT THE PHOTOGRAPH WE SAW EARLIER.  THE
     TWO SOLDIERS.  ONE, WE CAN ASSUME, IS DICK LLOYD.  THE
     OTHER IS MURTAUGH.  YOUNGER, TRIMMER.  HE SPEAKS INTO
     THE PHONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               HELLO, HONEY ... ?  GIVE ME THE
               NUMBER FOR DICK LLOYD.  WHAT ... ?
               YES, THE MAN WHO CALLED ME THIS
               MORNING.  HIS DAUGHTER JUST TOOK
               A DIVE OUT A WINDOW.

19A  EXT. CHRISTMAS TREE LOT  -  DAY                              19A

     MARTIN RIGGS AND THREE LOT EMPLOYEES ARE GATHERED AROUND
     THE LIFTGATE OF A TRUCK BEARING A LOAD OF CHRISTMAS TREES.
     THE TRUCK SHIELDS THEM FROM THE VIEW OF CUSTOMERS PICKING
     OUT TREES IN THE LOT.

     THE LOT EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY DRUG DEALERS.  THEY LOOK
     AROUND NERVOUSLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS AS RIGGS TASTES A
     SAMPLE OF THEIR WARES.

                         RIGGS
               GOOD STUFF.

                         DRUG DEALER ONE
               YOU BETTER FUCKIN' BELIEVE IT.

                         RIGGS
               OKAY.  LET'S DO IT.  HOW MUCH?

                         DRUG DEALER TWO
               HOW MUCH FOR HOW MUCH?

                         RIGGS
               FOR ALL  OF  IT.

                         DRUG DEALER THREE
               YOU WANT IT ALL?

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.
                    (GLANCES AT
                     THE TREES)
               AND MAYBE A NICE BIG SIX-FOOTER
               TO PUT IT UNDER.

                         DRUG DEALER ONE
               THE TREE YOU CAN HAVE FOR NUTHIN'.
               BUT THE SHIT IS GONNA RUN YOU A
               HUNDRED.

     RIGGS LETS OUT A SOFT WHISTLE AT THE AMOUNT.

                         RIGGS
               THAT MUCH, HUH?
                    (DIGS INTO
                     HIS   POCKET)
               OKAY.  LET'S SEE WHAT I GOT.

     HE PULLS OUT A ROLL OF MONEY AND BEGINS TO COUNT IT OUT
     IN TWENTIES AND SMALL BILLS.

                         RIGGS
               TWENTY, FORTY, SIXTY --

     THE DRUG DEALERS EXCHANGE DUMBFOUNDED EXPRESSIONS.

                         DRUG DEALER ONE
               HEY, MAN.  HEY!

                         RIGGS
               WAIT, WAIT ... SHUTUP.  I'M
               LOSIN  COUNT.  WHERE  WAS  I?   OH,
               YEAH...
                    (CONTINUES   TO
                     PEEL  OFF  THE
                     BILLS)
               ... EIGHT,   NINETY,   NINETY-FIVE,
               NINETY-SIX, NINETY-SEVEN...
                    (DIGS INTO HIS
                     POCKET FOR
                     LOOSE CHANGE)
               ... NINETY-SEVEN-FIFTY.      SIXTY.
               SEVENTY-FIVE.  OKAY, THERE'S
               NINETY-EIGHT  DOLLARS  AND   TWENTY
               CENTS...

     HE IS ABOUT TO CHECK HIS OTHER POCKET FOR CHANGE WHEN
     DRUG DEALER ONE STOPS HIM.

                         DRUG DEALER ONE
               FORGET  IT,   DUMBSHIT.

                         RIGGS
               C'MON.  I'M ALMOST THERE.  GIMME
               A MINUTE  TO  --

                        DRUG DEALER ONE
               ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND, YOU STUPID
               FUCK!  ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND!

     RIGGS IS FLOORED.  HE CAN'T BELIEVE HIS EARS.

                        RIGGS
               OH, JESUS ... I CAN'T AFFORD THAT.
               NOT ON MY SALARY.
                    (BEAT)
               LOOK... LET'S DO THIS INSTEAD ...
                    (PULLS OUT HIS
                     WALLET)
               I TAKE YOUR COMPLETE STASH, OKAY?
               I TAKE IT ALL.  FOR FREE.  AND
               YOU ASSHOLES GO TO JAIL.

     AS HE SAYS THIS, HE FLIPS OPEN HIS WALLET AND SHOWS HIS
     BADGE.  THE DRUG DEALERS AT FIRST LOOK STARTLED, THEN
     DISBELIEVING.

                         RIGGS
               I COULD READ YOU  YOUR  RIGHTS,
               BUT ... NAH.  YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT
               YOUR RIGHTS ARE.

                         DRUG  DEALER  ONE
               FUCK YOU, MAN.  THAT BADGE AIN'T
               REAL.  AND YOU AIN'T REAL.

                         DRUG  DEALER  TWO
               BUT YOU'RE SURE AS HELL ONE
               CRAZY FUCK!

     RIGGS' EYES BEGIN TO BLAZE.  HIS NOSTRILS FLARE.  LIKE
     A MANIAC, HE LUNGES AT DRUG  DEALER  TWO.

                         RIGGS
               YOU CALLIN' ME CRAZY!?  YOU
               THINK I'M CRAZY!  YOU, WANNA SEE
               CRAZY?  I'LL SHOW YOU CRAZY!
               THIS IS  CRAZY!

     RIGGS THEN PROCEEDS TO SLAP AND PUMMEL THE DRUG DEALER
     IN THE MANNER OF THE "THREE STOOGES"... COMPLETE WITH
     "WOO-WOO" SOUND  EFFECTS.

     BUT HE ENDS THE ROUTINE BY PULLING A NINE-MILLIMETER
     BARETTA FROM BEHIND HIS BACK AND PRESSING IT AGAINST
     THE NECK OF DRUG DEALER TWO.

                         RIGGS
               THAT'S A REAL BADGE.  I'M A REAL
               COP. AND THIS IS  A  REAL  GUN.
                    (TO THE OTHER TWO
                     DRUG DEALERS)
               FACE DOWN ON THE GROUND.  ARMS
               AND LEGS OUT.  DO IT NOW!

     DEALER ONE AND THREE BEGIN TO FOLLOW ORDERS      BUT RIGGS
     SEES A FLICKER IN THEIR EVES THAT          HIM TO TROUBLE.

      HE SPINS AROUND -- A FOURTH DRUG DEALER  IS  BEHIND  HIM
      WITH A SHOTGUN.  THE SHOTGUN EXPLODES.  RIGGS DUCKS,
      ALLOWING DRUG DEALER TWO TO TAKE THE  FULL  FORCE  OF  THE
      'BLAST IN THE  FACE.

      RIGGS ROLLS IN THE SAWDUST          FIRING HIS BERETTA.
      DEALER FOUR TAKES A BULLET BETWEEN THE EYES.
      DEALER TWO NOW HAS AN AUTOMATIC RIFLE IN HIS HAND.
      IT CHATTERS IN RIGGS' DIRECTION.  SAWDUST AND PINE
      NEEDLES FLY IN THE AIR -- BUT RIGGS IS ABLE TO BLOW
      HIM AWAY.

      ONE MORE DRUG DEALER LEFT.  RIGGS CAN'T FIND HIM.
      HIS EYES DART IN ALL DIRECTIONS.  WHERE IS HE?!

      BEHIND RIGGS, THAT'S WHERE!  HE  PRESSES  A  REVOLVER  TO
      THE BACK OF RIGGS' HEAD, TAKING RIGGS' BARETTA FROM
      HIM AND TUCKING IT INTO HIS BELT.

      THAT'S WHEN:

19B   FIVE NARCOTICS OFFICERS                               19B

      COME RUNNING FROM THEIR STAKEOUT  POSITIONS  AROUND  THE
      LOT. BUT THEY STOP SHORT WHEN  THEY  SEE  THAT  RIGGS  IS
      BEING HELD WITH A GUN POINTED TO HIS HEAD.

      THE DRUG DEALER BEGINS TO MOVE WITH  RIGGS  TOWARD  A  VAN
      PARKED NEARBY.

                          RIGGS
                     (TO OFFICERS)
                SHOOT HIM!  SHOOT HIM!

                          DRUG DEALER
                     (TO RIGGS)
                SHUT  UP!

                          RIGGS
                     (TO DRUG DEALER)
                FUCK YOU!
                     (TO OFFICERS)
                SHOOT HIM!  SHOOT HIM!

     THE NARCOTICS OFFICERS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  THEY
     ARE FRUSTRATED.  HELPLESS.  IMMOBILIZED.

     RIGGS SEES THE VAN LOOMING  UP.  THE  VAN  MEANS  DEFEAT.
     THE VAN MEANS DISGRACE. THE  VAN  MEANS  VICTORY  FOR  THE
     BAD GUYS, AND WE KNOW THAT RIGGS  WOULD  RATHER  DIE  THAN
     BE THE INSTRUMENT OF THE DEALER'S ESCAPE.

19C  CLOSE ON RIGGS AND DRUG DEALER                       19C

     THE VEINS ARE POPPING OUT IN RIGGS' NECK.  THE DRUG
     DEALER IS GETTING NERVOUS AND PANICKY.  HIS GUN HAND
     IS TREMBLING.  THE BARREL OF THE GUN JIGGLES AGAINST
     THE BACK OF  RIGGS'  HEAD.

                         RIGGS
                    (TO DRUG DEALER)
               DO IT, ASSHOLE.  PULL THE TRIGGER.
               PULL THE TRIGGER.

                         DRUG DEALER
               SHUT THE FUCK UP!

     THEY MOVE CLOSER TO THE VAN.  THE NARCOTICS OFFICERS
     HAVE THEIR GUNS POISED FOR ACTION, BUT DON'T DARE USE
     THEM.

                         DRUG DEALER
                    (TO OFFICERS)
               GUNS DOWN!  GUNS DOWN!

                         RIGGS
                    (TO OFFICERS)
               SHOOT HIM!  KILL HIM!
                    (TO DEALER)
               PULL THE TRIGGER!
                    (TO OFFICERS).
               WASTE HIM!
                    (TO DEALER)
               SHOOT ME!
                    (TO OFFICERS)
               KILL HIM!!

     THE DEALER IS SO FREAKED NOW THAT HIS GRIP ON RIGGS
     SLIPS MOMENTARILY -- AND RIGGS SEES HIS OPENING.

     HE SPINS.  KICKS THE DEALER IN THE GROIN.  DISLOCATES
     HIS ARM -- SENDING TLIE GUN  FLYING.  RIGGS RETRIEVES HIS
     BARETTA FROM THE DEALER'S BELT  AND  SHOVES THE BARREL
     INTO THE DEALER'S FACE.

     RIGGS' ENTIRE BODY QUAKES  WITH  RAGE.  HIS FINGER BEGINS
     TO SQUEEZE BACK ON THE  TRIGGER.  HE  WANTS TO KILL THE
     GUY SO BAD HE CAN TASTE IT... AND  YET,  HE      DOESN'T DO IT.

     THE OTHER OFFICERS ARRIVE AND STEP BETWEEN RIGGS AND
     THE DEALER.

     RIGGS TURNS AWAY.  BREATLIING HARD.  ADRENALIN PUMPING.
     HE TUCKS THE BARETTA INTO HIS BELT, THEN NOTICES THAT
     HIS HAND IS COVERED WITH THE SPILLED BLOOD OF ONE OF
     THE DRUG DEALERS.

     IT GIVES RIGGS  PAUSE.  FOR A MOMENT, HE JUST LOOKS AT
     IT.

     HOLD ON RIGGS.   VERY CLOSE.  AND THE LOOK IN HIS EYES.

               NO.  NO???  CAPTAIN, HE WALKED
               INTO THE LINE OF FIRE.

                         MURPHY
               VERY BRAVE INDIVIDUAL,  DON'T
               YOU THINK... ?

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               THIS IS UTTER BULLSHIT.

                         MURPHY
               OH, IS IT?  FORGIVE ME.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               MARTIN RIGGS IS A COP WITH  A
               DEATH WISH.

     MURPHY SHOOTS HER AN INCREDULOUS  LOOK.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YOU CAN QUOTE ME.  IT HAPPENS TO
               BE MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION.

                         MURPHY
               UM... GOOD OPINION. SEE  YOU
               TOMORROW.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               CAPTAIN...

                         MURPHY
               LOOK, DOC, YOU'RE  WAY  OFF.  WAY
               OFF.  KNOW WHAT I THINK?  I THINK
               RIGGS IS PULLING FOR A PSYCHO
               PENSION.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               OH, DO YOU?

                         MURPHY
               YEAH.  I AM SURE YOU'RE AWARE THE
               DEPARTMENT OFFERS  A  DISABILITY
               STRESS PENSION --

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YES, I'M AWARE --

                         MURPHY
               -- EXCEPT WE DON'T OFFER  IT  TO
               EVERYBODY, ONLY COPS WHO SEEM TO
               SUFFER FROM

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               -- FROM ABNORMAL STRESS,  YES,  I
               KNOW.  OR  SUICIDAL  TENDENCIES.

                         MURPHY
               GIVE THE LADY A CIGAR.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YOU THINK RIGGS IS PLAYING A GAME?

                         MURPHY
               SURE. HE  WANTS  THE  CASH.  SEEN
               IT A HUNDRED  TIMES.  HE'LL  COME
               AROUND.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               SIR, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT ...  I
               THINK THAT'S A DANGEROUS ATTITUDE
               TO TAKE. MAY I  REMIND  YOU  THAT
               HIS WIFE OF ELEVEN YEARS WAS
               RECENTLY KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT,
               AND

                         MURPHY
               I KNOW ALL ABOUT RIGGS, DOC.  HE'S
               A TOUGH BASTARD.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
                    (INTENSE)
               HE IS ON THE EDGE.  HE MAY BE
               PSYCHOTIC.

                         MURPHY
               BUNCH OF PSYCH BULLSHIT-  LOOK,
               CAN I PEE NOW?

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE
               BY LEAVING HIM IN THE FIELD.
               HE'S   SUICIDAL.

                         MURPHY
               END OF DISCUSSION.  WE'RE GONNA
               WAIT.  AND THEN, IF HE OFFS
               HIMSELF ... WELL, THEN WE'LL KNOW
               I WAS WRONG.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
               YES, SIR.  THEN WE'LL KNOW.

     RAIN  SWEEPS  IN  OFF  THE  DESERT.  COLD.  DRENCHING.  RIGGS
     WALKS SLOWLY TOWARD HIS TRAILER HOME, HEAD DOWN.  THE
     RAIN BEATS ON HIM.  HE  DOESN'T  NOTICE.  UNDER  HIS  ARM  HE
     CARRIES A LARGE CARDBOARD BOX.

28   INT. RIGGS' TRAILER - SAME TIME                                 28

     RIGGS ENTERS, SOAKING WET.  SWITCHES ON THE LAMP.
     DEPRESSING.  JAKE  APPEARS,  TAIL  A-THUMP.  TONGUE   WAGGING
     DOGGISHLY.  RIGGS REACHES ATOP THE REFRIGERATOR, GRABS
     A BAG OF PEANUTS.
     OPENS IT, TOSSES IT TO THE DOG.

                         RIGGS
               SAM, EVERY DAY ... IN EVERY WAY ...
               I'M GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.

     OPENS THE BOX AND  REMOVES  ITS  CONTENTS.  BRAND  NEW  COLOR
     TELEVISION.  PLUGS IT IN.  SWITCHES IT ON.  SITS DOWN
     WITH A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.  DRINKS.  ON THE SCREEN, THE
     GRINCH STEALS CHRISTMAS FROM THE RESIDENTS OF WHOVILLE.

     RIGGS OPENS A DRAWER BESIDE HIM, AND TAKES OUT A BOTTLE
     OF SLEEPING PILLS. PICKS IT  UP.  AS  HE  DOES  --  THE  SOUND
     OF THE TELEVISION FADES OUT -- SILENCE, DEAD SILENCE...
     AS RIGGS ROLLS THE BOTTLE IN HIS FINGERS.  SLOWLY,
     THOUGHTFULLY, UNSCREWS THE CAP ... DUMPS THEM ON THE TABLE.
     RUNS HIS  FINGERS  THROUGH  THEM.  CLICK...  CLICK...  STARES.
     MESMERIZED.  RAIN BEATS ON THE WINDOW.

     A ZOO.  A SIGN READS METRO ROBBERY/HOMICIDE.

     ROGER MURTAUGH SITS AT HIS DESK, LOST IN THOUGHT.
     BEHIND HIM, MCCASKEY, CLASS THREE DETECTIVE.  HE TALKS
     TO MURTAUGH:

                         MCCASKEY
               SEE, YOU'RE BEHIND THE TIMES,
               SARGE.  GUYS IN THE EIGHTIES
               AREN'T TOUGH.  THEY'RE SENSITIVE
               PEOPLE.  THEY SHOW EMOTIONS AROUND
               WOMEN AND SHIT LIKE THAT.
                    (BEAT)
               I THINK I'M AN EIGHTIES MAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               HOW YOU FIGURE?

                         MCCASKEY
               LAST NIGHT:  I CRIED IN BED, SO
               HOW'S THAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               WERE YOU WITH A  WOMAN?
                         MCCASKEY
               NO, I WAS ALONE, WHY THE FUCK YOU
               THINK I WAS CRYING?

                         MURTAUGH
               SOUNDS LIKE AN EIGHTIES MAN TO ME.

     ANOTHER DETECTIVE ENTERS.  RAIL-THIN, NOSE LIKE A BEAK.
     HIS NAME IS BURKE.

     BEHIND HIM IN THE DOOR FRAME WE SEE A FAT COP PASS BY
     DOWN THE HALL, WALKING BACKWARDS; A BEAT, AND THEN HE  IS
     FOLLOWED BY FOUR MORE COPS SINGING THE WORLD'S  SHITTIEST
     RENDITION OF "IT CAME UPON A MIDNIGHT CLEAR."  IT  SOUNDS
     LIKE PIGS MATING.

     BURKE APPROACHES MURTAUGH:

                         BURKE
               GOT SOME NEWS ON THE LLOYD CASE,
               ROG.

                         MURTAUGH
               THAT WAS QUICK.

                         BURKE
               SO WAS THE AUTOPSY.
                    (TAKES A DEEP
                     BREATH)
               YOU READY FOR THIS?  THEY'RE NOT
               CALLING IT SUICIDE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT?

                         BURKE
               SURPRISE, SURPRISE.  FIRST OFF,
               CORONER FOUND EVIDENCE SHE TOOK
               BARBITURATES.

                         MURTAUGH
               BRILLIANT.  THERE WAS AN OPEN
               BOTTLE ON HER TABLE.

                         BURKE
               RIGHT, RIGHT.  THAT'S NOT THE
               SURPRISE.  SURPRISE IS SOMEONE
               DOCTORED  THE  PILLS.
                    (BEAT)
               EVERY CAPSULE WAS LOADED WITH
               DRAIN   CLEANER.

                         MURTAUGH
               JESUS ...

                         BURKE
               IF SHE HADN'T JUMPED, SHE WOULDA
               BEEN DEAD INSIDE FIFTEEN MINUTES.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (SIGHS)
               THIS CASE BLOWS.

     ACROSS THE ROOM, A DETECTIVE TAKES OFF HIS GUN AND
     SLINGS THE HOLSTER ACROSS HIS CHAIR.  AS HE EXITS FRAME
     -- PAN TO REVEAL:  MARTIN RIGGS AS HE ENTERS THE SQUAD
     ROOM.  SHUFFLES FROM FOOT TO FOOT, LOOKING LOST.  LIGHTS
     A SMOKE.

33   ACROSS ROOM                                               33

     MURTAUGH SLINGS ON A JACKET.  TURNS TO GO.  NOTICES
     RIGGS.

34   MURTAUGH'S POV                                            34

     RIGGS RESEMBLES A BAG PERSON.  UNSHAVEN, LIMP DIRTY
     HAIR, GRIMY LEATHER JACKET.

35   BACK TO SCENE                                             35

     HE FROWNS, SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               MCCASKEY, IF MY WIFE CALLS, TELL
               HER LATE DINNER.

                         BURKE
               HO, ROG-  I'M NOT THROUGH YET.
               I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU TWO MORE
               THINGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               SHOOT.

     HE IS STILL LOOKING AT RIGGS, WHO IS SLOWLY WANDERING
     FROM DESK TO DESK, SMOKING -- STOPPING NEAR THE DESK WITH
     THE HOLSTERED GUN.

                         BURKE
               FIRST, CONDITION OF THE SHEETS AND
               MATTRESS INDICATE SOMEONE WAS IN
               BED WITH AMANDA LLOYD JUST BEFORE
               SHE DIED.  THAT'S A.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S B?

                         BURKE
               B IS, I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU
               YOU'RE BREAKING IN A NEW PARTNER
               ON THIS.

     NOW MURTAUGH IS EYEBALLING RIGGS.  CAUTIOUS.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (DISTRACTED)
               I DON'T WORK PARTNERS.

                         BURKE
               YOU DO NOW.  C.I.T. TRANSFER, SOME
               BURNOUT THEY WANT YOU TO KEEP ON
               A LEASH.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, PERFECT.  CAN I TRADE IN MY
               LIFE FOR A NEW ONE?

     AT WHICH POINT, ACROSS THE ROOM, RIGGS REMOVES THE HOL-
     STERED GUN AND HEFTS IT, CURIOUSLY.  SUDDENLY ALL HELL
     BREAKS LOOSE:

                         MURTAUGH
               GUN !!

     HE BOLTS LIKE A CHEETAH.

     COPS DIVE FOR COVER, A SECRETARY SHRIEKS, AND MURTAUGH
     GOES PLOWING THROUGH THE SQUAD ROOM LIKE AN EXPRESS
     TRAIN, BLOWING PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY -- COPS GRABBING
     FOR THEIR HOLSTERS -- RIGGS, MEANWHILE, LOOKING AROUND
     FRANTICALLY, HE'S TRYING TO FIND THE GUY WITH THE GUN
     WHO IS, OF COURSE, HIMSELF.

     MURTAUGH TAKES A FLYING LEAP      SAILS ACROSS
     THE DESK, GOING FOR  THE  GLORY   AND RIGGS, IN THE
     BLINK OF AN EYE,  SIMPLY  DUCKS   AND FLIPS MURTAUGH
     NEATLY OVER ONE SHOULDER.  THERE  IS A HIDEOUS CRASH
     OF BREAKING GLASS AND OVERTURNING FURNITURE.  OUCH...
     MCCASKEY, MEANWHILE, SCREAMS TO BURKE:

                         MCCASKEY
               WHAT THE SHIT IS GOING ON?

     BURKE SIGHS, SHAKES  HIS  HEAD:

               MY PEOPLE ARE LOYAL, MR. MENDEZ.

     IT.  MENDEZ LOOKS ON, A TRIFLE PALE.

     AS FOR JOSHUA, HE MAKES NO SOUND AT ALL.  SIMPLY STANDS,
     TRANCE-LIKE.

                         GENERAL
               YOU WISH TO DO BUSINESS WITH US,

               MR. JOSHUA IS IN A GREAT DEAL OF
               PAIN.  YOU WISH TO MAKE A PURCHASE,

               BAD MANNERS, MAN.

     RIGGS REMOVES THE GUN HIMSELF.  STEERS WITH HIS KNEES.
     DROPS THE CHAMBERED BULLET.  SLIPS OUT THE MAGAZINE,
     HANDS THE GUN TO ------------

               FILE DON'T LIE.  LOOK, FRIEND,
               LET'S CUT THE SHIT.  WE BOTH
               KNOW WHY I WAS TRANSFERRED.

               WE'RE BOTH FUCKED.

                    RIGGS
                  TERRIFIC.

     AS THEY SPEAK, RIGGS HAS PULLED TO A  STOP  IN  FRONT  OF  A
     LARGE  DOWNTOWN  BANK  BUILDING.

                         MURTAUGH

               DICK, WHY DID YOU CALL ME
               YESTERDAY?

                         LLOYD
                    (VERY  FAR  AWAY)
               CALLED YOU...?  YEAH.  THAT'S
               RIGHT ... I HEARD YOU WERE WORKING
               OUT HERE ... I WANTED  YOU  TO  FIND
               HER  FOR  ME,  ROGER.  TAKE  HER

                         MURTAUGH
               OUT OF WHAT?

                         LLOYD
               SHE DID MOVIES, ROGER ... NAKED
               MOVIES ... SAW ONE OF THEM......  SAW
               MY LITTLE BABY ... SMILING......  SHE
               DID IT ... WITH  A  WOMAN.  SHE    WAS
               ON TOP OF  A  WOMAN,  ROGER-...!

                         MURTAUGH
               EASY, DICK.

     LLOYD TURNS, FACING THEM.  INTENSE:

                         LLOYD
               I WANT A PROMISE.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU OWE ME.  YOU KNOW YOU DO.

                         MURTAUGH
               YES.  I KNOW THAT.

                         LLOYD
               WHEN YOU FIND WHO  DID  IT,  I  WANT
               YOU TO KILL THEM.  IF IT'S MORE
               THAN ONE, I WANT YOU TO KILL ALL OF
               THEM.  MAKE THEM SQUIRM FIRST, TAKE
               YOUR TIME ... AND FUCKING KILL THEM.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M A POLICE OFFICER, DICK.

                         LLOYD
               FORGET THE LAW.  IT'S EASY TO DO.
               YOU OWE ME.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (PAUSE; THEN)
               WE HAVE TO GO NOW.

     LLOYD DOES NOT LOOK UP.  RIGGS AND MURTAUGH HEAD FOR THE
     DOOR.

                         LLOYD
               I KNOW YOU CAN, ROGER.  YOU KILL
               THEM. YOU  DO  THAT.

     THE COPS EXIT.  THE DOOR SHUTS.

42   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                              42

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH HEAD IOR THE CAR.  RIGGS TAKES OUT A
     PACK OF CIGARETTES.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU GONNA SMOKE IN THE CAR?

                         RIGGS
               THINKING ABOUT IT.

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC.

     HE PUTS THE TOP DOWN.
     RIGGS TAKES OUT A CIGARETTE, STARTS TO PUT IT IN HIS
     MOUTH.  STOPS.

                         RIGGS
               WHOOPS.  SHIT.

     HE REPLACES IT IN THE PACK, TAKES ANOTHER.  MURTAUGH
     LOOKS AT HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THAT ONE?

     RIGGS POINTS TO THE TIP OF THE REPLACED CIGARETTE.  WE
     NOTICE TWO THINGS:  A)  IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT FIFTY
     YEARS OLD; AND  B) THERE IS A TINY RED MARK, CIRCLING THE
     FILTER.

                         RIGGS
               THIS ONE IS THE LAST CIGARETTE
               I'LL EVER SMOKE.
               TRICK I LEARNED FROM  MY  DAD.  I
               SMOKE ALL I WANT, BUT WHEN I SMOKE
               THIS ONE ... I'M THROUGH.

                         MURTAUGH
               BRILLIANT.  GET IN THE CAR.

                         RIGGS
               WANT ME TO DRIVE?

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE SUICIDAL, REMEMBER?

                         RIGGS
               ANYONE WHO DRIVES IN LOS ANGELES
               IS SUICIDAL.

     THEY GET IN.  MURTAUGH HEAVES A SIGH, STARES BLEAKLY OUT
     THE WINDOW.  A MOMENT, THEN RIGGS SAYS:

                         RIGGS
               HE SAID YOU OWED  HIM.  WHAT  DID
               HE MEAN?

                         MURTAUGH
               WE SERVED TOGETHER  IN  '65.  HE
               SAVED MY LIFE IN THE LA DRANG
               VALLEY.  TOOK A BAYONET  IN  THE
               LUNG.

                         RIGGS
               THAT WAS NICE OF HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               I THOUGHT SO.

                         MURTAUGH
               STOW IT.

43   EXT. CITY INTERSECTION - DAY                            43

     A BUILDING, TEN STORIES HIGH.  ON THE LEDGE, A LONE MAN
     POISED HIGH ABOVE THE STREET.  BENEATH HIM, A CROWD HAS
     GATHERED.  A POLICE CAR.  A SEARCHLIGHT.  A CROWD OF
     OFFICE WORKERS, RUBBER-NECKING TO BEAT THE BAND.  ONE OR
     TWO KIDS YELL, "JUMP, JUMP."

     MURTAUGH'S CAR GLIDES TO THE CURB.  THE DOORS BURST OPEN
     AND THE TWO PARTNERS EMERGE.  A PATROL COP APPROACHES.

                         PATROL  COP
               HEY, SARGE, YOU WANNA HANDLE
               THIS?

               SALESMAN NAME OF MACCLEARY.  LEFT
               THE OFFICE PARTY.  WENT UPSTAIRS
               AND WALKED OUT ON THE LEDGE.

                         MURTAUGH
               THINK HE'LL GO?

                         PATROL  COP
               SEEMS SERIOUS ENOUGH.  WHO KNOWS?

     RIGGS CLEARS HIS THROAT.  MURTAUGH TURNS.

                         RIGGS
               I CAN HANDLE THIS.

                         MURTAUGH

                         MURTAUGH
                    (RELUCTANT;  THEN)
               OKAY.  YOU'RE ELECTED.
                    (AS RIGGS
                     TURNS TO GO)
               HEY.

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGHT.

     RIGGS MOVES OFF TOWARD THE BUILDING.  MURTAUGH LOOKS
     AFTER HIM.  WAS THIS A MISTAKE ... ?

               BULLSHIT, IT WON'T WORK.

                         RIGGS
               I'M NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST.

     CALM.

                         RIGGS
               WHY  ARE  YOU  DOING  THIS?

                         MACCLEARY

                     (PAUSE; THEN)
               I'M COMING OUT.  TAKE IT EASY.

     RIGGS STANDS, STEPS OUT ONTO THE NARROW LEDGE.  HE SEEMS
     UNCONCERNED.

                         MACCLEARY
               DON'T  COME  NEAR  ME!

     ON THE GROUND BELOW, ROGER MURTAUGH REACTS WITH DISBELIEF.
     HIS PARTNER IS TAKING AN INSANE RISK.  UP ABOVE, RIGGS
     PAUSES.  AROUND HIM THE WIND BLOWS TREACHEROUSLY.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST GUY TO THINK
               OF THIS, YOU KNOW.  EVERYONE'S GOT
               PROBLEMS.

                         MACCLEARY
               YOU KNOW SHIT.

                         RIGGS
               WRONG.  YOU'RE WRONG.
                    (BEAT)
               I ALMOST TRIED THIS ONCE.
               SERIOUSLY.  MY WIFE.  GOT KILLED
               IN A CAR CRASH.  ONLY PERSON I
               EVER CARED ABOUT.  I NEVER HAD

                         MACCLEARY
               YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART.

     RIGGS TAKES OUT HIS WALLET, FLASHES IT AT MACCLEARY.

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS HER PICTURE.

               I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU I UNDERSTAND,
               YOU DOPE.

     HE TAKES A STEP CLOSER.

                         MACCLEARY
               DON'T TOUCH ME.  I'M NOT DOING
               ANYTHING WRONG.

                         RIGGS
               I KNOW THAT.  NOT LIKE YOU'RE
               MURDERING ANYONE.

                         MACCLEARY
               RIGHT.  ONLY ONE HURT IS ME.

               JUST ... LET ME STAND NEXT TO YOU.

                         MACCLEARY
               DON'T TRY NOTHING.

                         RIGGS
               I TRY SOMETHING, WE BOTH GO.

                         MACCLEARY
               RIGHT.

     RIGGS SLOWLY STEPS UP TO THE MAN.  SHUDDERS.

                         RIGGS
               YOU WANNA SMOKE?
                    (PULLS OUT
                     CIGARETTES)
               LET'S SMOKE, OKAY?

                         MACCLEARY
               SURE.

     RIGGS OFFERS A SMOKE.  MACCLEARY REACHES FOR IT.  AND RIGGS
     SNAPS A HANDCUFF ON HIS WRIST.  SNAPS THE OTHER END ONTO
     HIS OWN WRIST.

                         MACCLEARY
               HEY ...

                         RIGGS

               SEE  THIS  KEY?

     HE HOLDS UP THE KEY TO THE CUFFS.  FLINGS IT OUT INTO
     SPACE.

                         RIGGS
               WE'RE  TOGETHER  ON  THIS.  YOU  CAN
               GO IF YOU  WANT.  BUT  YOU  TAKE  ME
               WITH  YOU.  MAKES  YOU  A  MURDERER.

                         MACCLEARY
               YOU BASTARD.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'LL BE KILLING A COP.

     SILENCE.

                         RIGGS
               I'M GOING INSIDE.  WHAT SAY YOU
               COME WITH ME?

     HE TURNS, STARTS TO EASE ALONG THE LEDGE.  MACCLEARY
     SWALLOWS HARD, SAYS:

                         MACCLEARY
               FUCK YOU, I'M JUMPING.

     AND SUDDENLY RIGGS TURNS ON HIM.  EYES LIKE STEEL.

                         RIGGS
               YOU WANNA JUMP ... ?  YOU REALLY
               WANT TO ... ?
                    (LONG  PAUSE;
                     THEN)
               FINE. LET'S  DO  IT.

     HE STEPS TO THE EDGE.

                        MACCLEARY
              HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ...

                        RIGGS
              YOU ASKED FOR IT.

                        MACCLEARY
              HEY, WAIT A MINUTE ... !

     RIGGS DOES SOMETHING VERY  DRASTIC.  HE  JERKS  THEM  BOTH
     OFF THE LEDGE.  HOLY SHIT.  THE CROWD GASPS.

     FALLING -- MACCLEARY SHRIEKING LIKE A LUNATIC ... AND
     SUDDENLY, BAM -- !  THEY LAND IN A FIREMAN'S NET.  BOUNCE
     A FEW TIMES. COME TO REST, SAFE  AND  UNHARMED  ...  RIGGS
     ROLLS OVER WITH A SOUR LOOK ON HIS FACE.  COPS SURROUND
     THEM.  MACCLEARY IS A TRIFLE UPSET.

     AND SO ON, SCREAMING AND RANTING --  AS  A  UNIFORMED  COP
     CUTS RIGGS FREE WITH A SET OF CLIPPERS.  RIGGS STANDS
     SHAKILY. STEPS AWAY FROM  THE  NET.  AND  THERE  IS  ROGER
     MURTAUGH.  VISIBLY   UPSET.

     DID I SAY UPSET?  I MEANT ENRAGED.  HE GRABS RIGGS, SLAMS
     HIM AGAINST THE WALL.  TRIES TO GRAB HIS COLLAR.  RIGGS'
     HAND SHOOTS OUT.  LIGHTNING FAST.  STOPS MURTAUGH'S HAND.
     STOPS IT COLD.  THEY STARE INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES.

                         RIGGS
               DON'T ... TOUCH ME.

     MURTAUGH WILL NOT BACK DOWN.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST DO???

                         RIGGS
               I CONTROLLED THE JUMP.  YOU WANTED
               HIM DOWN.  HE'S DOWN.

                         MURTAUGH
               C'MERE.


     HE YANKS RIGGS AROUND THE CORNER, AWAY FROM THE OTHER
     COPS.

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY, TURKEY, NO BULLSHIT.  DO YOU
               WANT  TO  KILL  YOURSELF?

                         RIGGS
               AW, FOR CHRISSAKE ...

                         MURTAUGH
               SHUT UP.  JUST YES OR NO, DO YOU
               WANT TO DIE?  HUH?  YES OR NO?

                         RIGGS
               I GOT THE JOB DONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING THE
               QUESTION!!!

                         RIGGS
                    (ANGRY)
               WHAT DO YOU WANNA HEAR, MAN?  YOU
               WANNA HEAR THAT I GOT A BOTTLE OF
               PILLS IN MY ROOM?  I DO.  EVERY
               DAY I WAKE UP, I LOOK FOR A REASON
               NOT TO TAKE THEM.  DOING THE JOB,
               THAT'S ... THAT'S THE REASON.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT HIM.  NODS.  A MOMENT, THEN:

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU WANT TO DIE.

                         RIGGS
               I'M NOT AFRAID OF IT.

                         MURTAUGH
               HERE.
                    (UNHOLSTERS
                     HIS GUN)
               PILLS ARE TOO SLOW.  USE A GUN.
               USE MY GUN.  GO AHEAD, PAL.

     A PAUSE.   RIGGS LOOKS AT THE GUN.

                         MURTAUGH
               BE MY GUEST.

     HE OFFERS THE GUN TO RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               GO AHEAD.  IF YOU'RE SERIOUS.

     RIGGS SMILES, TAKES THE GUN WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT.  PUTS
     IT TO HIS HEAD.  CLICK -- !  THE HAMMER IS COCKED.
     MURTAUGH AND RIGGS STARE EACH OTHER DOWN.  TENSE.  READING
     EACH  OTHER.

                         RIGGS
               YOU SHOULDN'T TEMPT ME, ROGER.

                         MURTAUGH
               PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH.  BULLET GOES
               IN YOUR EAR, MIGHT NOT KILL YOU.

     MEANWHILE, IN THE B.G., PEDESTRIANS ARE DIVING FOR COVER.
     MURTAUGH AND RIGGS ARE OBLIVIOUS.  RIGGS PUTS THE GUN
     UNDER HIS CHIN.

                         RIGGS
               UNDER THE CHIN'S JUST AS GOOD.

     THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER.  RIGGS' FINGER BEGINS TO
     TIGHTEN ON THE TRIGGER.  TURNS WHITE WITH PRESSURE.
     IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO DO IT.
     AT THE LAST SECOND, MURTAUGH JAMS HIS THUMB IN FRONT OF
     THE HAINMER, AND CLICK
     JESUS ...
     THE HAINMER THUDS AGAINST HIS THUMB.

     MURTAUGH GRABS THE GUN.  STARES AT RIGGS, WILD-EYED.

                         MURTAUGH
               JESUS.  YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO DRAW
               A PSYCHO PENSION.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU'RE REALLY CRAZY ...

                    (SMILES  COLDLY)
               SO NOW YOU KNOW.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  NOW I KNOW.

               VERY HELPFUL.

     HE HANGS UP.  RUBS HIS EYES TIREDLY AND SAYS:

               I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT.

     SILENCE.  MURTAUGH FUMES.  RIGGS KEEPS HIS MOUTH SHUT.
     MURTAUGH TAKES HIS ANGER OUT ON THE ROAD:  SLAMMING THE
     BRAKES; SQUEALING AROUND CORNERS, ETC.

     BUT HE CAN'T HOLD IT 'IN.  HE EXPLODES:

                         MURTAUGH
                    (POUNDING HIS FIST
                     AGAINST THE WHEEL)
               IT'S MY  BIRTHDAY,  DAMNIT!  FIFTY
               YEARS OLD TODAY!  FIFTY GODDAMN
               YEARS OLD!  THIRTY YEARS ON THE
               FORCE!  NOT A SCRATCH ON ME!  NOT
               A SCAR!  I GOT A WIFE!  KIDS!
               HOUSE! FISHING  BOAT!  BUT  I  CAN
               KISS ALL THAT GOODBYE,  'CAUSE  MY
               NEW PARTNER'S GOT A DEATH WISH!
               MY FUCKIN' LIFE IS OVER!

                         RIGGS
               ROGER --

                         MURTAUGH
               SHUT UP!  WHY YOU TALKIN' TO ME?!
               I'M NOT HE'RE ANYMORE!  I'M  GONE!
               I'M DEAD!  YOU'RE GONNA SEE TO
               THAT!  YOU WANNA DIE -- AND YOU'RE
               GONNA TAKE ME WITH YOU!

     SILENCE AGAIN.  MURTAUGH GNASHES HIS TEETH.  RIGGS  LOOKS
     AT HIM WITH A VERY SERIOUS EXPRESSION.

                         RIGGS
               I DIDN'T  KNOW  THAT.

                         MURTAUGH
               KNOW WHAT?!

                         RIGGS
               THAT TODAY WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY.
                    (BEAT)
               HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ROGER.  I MEAN
               THAT SINCERELY.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS TAKEN ABACK BY THE GENUINE SOUND OF  AFFEC-
     TION IN RIGGS' VOICE.

                         RIGGS
               I JUST HOPE WE STAY ALIVE LONG
               ENOUGH FOR ME TO BUY YOU A PRESENT.

     RIGGS SAYS THIS WITH A STRAIGHT FACE -- BUT THERE IS
     A PLAYFUL GLINT IN HIS EYE THAT MURTAUGH DOESN'T MISS.
     AND HE LAUGHS OUT LOUD IN SPITE OF HIMSELF.  IT BREAKS
     THE TENSION, AND RIGGS  KNOWS  IT.

                         RIGGS
               WHERE WE GOING?

                         MURTAUGH
               BEVERLY HILLS.
                    (BEAT)
               GOT AN ADDRESS ON AMANDA
               HUNSECKER'S MEAL TICKET.  BUT
               REMEMBER ... THIS GUY ISN'T A
               SUSPECT YET.  WE'RE GONNA
               QUESTION HIM; NOT DAMAGE
               HIM.

     RIGGS RAISES HIS HANDS -- AS IF TO SAY, I'LL BE ON MY
     BEST BEHAVIOR.  MURTAUGH SWINGS THE CAR ONTO SUNSET
     BLVD.

49   EXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOME - TWILIGHT                      49

     THE KIND OF HOUSE THAT I'LL BUY IF THIS MOVIE IS A HUGE
     HIT.  CHROME.  GLASS.  CARVED WOOD.  PLUS AN OUTDOOR
     SOLARIUM:  A GLASS STRUCTURE, LIKE A GREENHOUSE ONLY
     THERE'S A BIG SWIMMING POOL INSIDE.  THIS IS A REALLY
     GREAT PLACE TO HAVE SEX.

50   INT. SOLARIUM                                                50

     THE SWIMMING POOL IS COVERED BY A VINYL TARPAULIN.
     SURROUNDED BY A JUNGLE OF PLANTS.

51   AT POOLSIDE TABLE                                        51

     SITS A VERY RICH PERSON.  HE IS WEARING AN $800 DESIGNER
     ENSEMBLE.  BESIDE HIM, AN ELEGANTLY-APPOINTED SHOTGUN
     LEANS AGAINST THE TABLE.  HE IS ON THE PHONE.

                         RICH GUY
               LISTENS ASSHOLE, YOU GOTTA TELL
               ME THESE THINGS ... YEAH, WE GOT
               A PROBLEM.  MY MARGIN IS COMPLETELY
               FUCKED UP, AND WE GOT ATHLETES
               SNORTING THE SHIT AND PITCHING
               OVER DEAD, HOW'S THAT FOR A
               PROBLEM... ?  YES, I'M HOLDING
               TWO KEYS NOW.  TERRIFIC, CALL
               ME BACK.

                                              CUT TO:

52   EXT. WOODEN GATE - SAME TIME                              52

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH APPROACH THE GATE.  RIGGS TOSSES OUT
     A CIGARETTE.  SUDDENLY --
     THERE IS AN ELECTRIC HUM AND THE GATE GLIDES SOFTLY OPEN,
     ADMITTING A RED HONDA SCOOTER, A DASHING BLONDE BEHIND
     THE WHEEL.  SHE ROARS OFF DOWN THE STREET.

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH EXCHANGE GLANCES.
     THE GATE CLICKS, STARTS TO GLIDE SHUT.

     THE COPS ENTER.

53   EXT. HOUSE WINDOW - SAME TIME                              53

     RIGGS' FACE COMES INTO FRAME, PEERING CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH
     A PLATE GLASS WINDOW.  HE WHISTLES SOFTLY.

                         RIGGS
               TAKE A LOOK.

     MURTAUGH STEPS TO THE WINDOW, LOOKS IN.

54   MURTAUGH'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW                       54

     ENOUGH COCAINE TO SERVICE THE THIRD TIER AT YANKEE
     STADIUM.

     A BLONDE, BIKINI-CLAD WONDER SITS ON THE COUCH, HAPPILY
     SNORTING.  SHE SEES MURTAUGH AND WAVES HILARIOUSLY.
     MAKES COME-HITHER GESTURES.

     MURTAUGH SCOWLS, TURNS TO RIGGS.

                         RIGGS
               I'M THINKING PROBABLE CAUSE.

                         MURTAUGH
               JESUS.  MAYBE I SHOULD CALL FOR
               BACKUP.

                         RIGGS
               WHAT AM I, CHOPPED LIVER?

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT HIM.  SIGHS.

                         MURTAUGH
               NO KILLING.

                         RIGGS
               NO KILLING.

     HE GRINS CHEESILY-

56   EXT. SOLARIUM                                                  56

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH APPROACH  THE  FROSTED  GLASS  DOOR.  THEY
     DRAW THEIR GUNS.

                         MURTAUGH
               NICE AND EASY.

                         RIGGS
               NICE AND EASY.

     MURTAUGH TAKES A DEEP BREATH.  KICKS OPEN THE DOOR.

                         MURTAUGH
               POLICE.  HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

57   INT. SOLARIUM                                                  57

     THE RICH GUY DOES NOT HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.  IN FACT, HE
     HAS ALREADY SNATCHED UP THE SHOTGUN.  HE TRIGGERS A
     BLAST, BLOWS OUT GLASS  NEXT  TO  MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH  DIVES,
     ROLLS, COMES UP IN A COMBAT CROUCH.  BAM --- THE RICH
     GUY TAKES IT IN THE SHOULDER.  SPINS AROUND.  THE GUN
     CLATTERS TO THE GROUND.  RIGGS AND MURTAUGH APPROACH,
     GUNS DRAWN.  THE RICH GUY WRITHES ON THE GROUND, CLUTCH-
     ING HIS SHOULDER.  MURTAUGH SAYS TO RIGGS:

                         MURTAUGH
               SEE HOW EASY THAT WAS?  BOOM.
               STILL ALIVE.  NOW WE TAKE THE GUN
               AWAY ...
                    (HE DOES)
               ... AND WE QUESTION HIM.  KNOW
               WHY WE CAN QUESTION HIM?  BECAUSE
               I GOT HIM IN THE SHOULDER.  I
               DIDN'T BLOW HIM UP OR JUMP OFF A
               BUILDING WITH HIM.

                         RIGGS
               NO FAIR, THE  BUILDING  GUY  LIVED.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHATEVER.  THE POINT IS, NO
               KILLING.

                         RIGGS
               NO KILLING.

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGHT.  PIECE  OF  CAKE.  I'M  VERY
               HAPPY. READ  THE  MAN  HIS  RIGHTS,
               I'LL BE OVER HERE BEING HAPPY.

     UNFORTUNATELY ... AS MURTAUGH SPEAKS, HE DOES NOT  SEE  THE
     MAN ON THE GROUND HAS A HIDEAWAY GUN TUCKED INTO HIS
     WAISTBAND. AS MURTAUGH TALKS, OBLIVIOUS ...  THE  GUY  TAKES
     OUT THE GUN WITH HIS GOOD ARM -- AND  AIMS  DEAD  CENTER-AT
     MURTAUGH'S BACK.  RIGGS, HOWEVER, NOTICES.  AND SPRINGS
     INTO ACTION. BEFORE THE RICH GUY CAN FIRE  ...  RIGGS'  FOOT
     FLASHES OUT LIKE A PILE DRIVER.  CRACK!  THE GUY FLIES
     BACKWARD. LANDS ON TOP  OF  THE  POOL  TARPAULIN.  OOPS.  IT
     PROMPTLY SURROUNDS HIM IN A SUCKING, VICE-LIKE GRIP.
     MURTAUGH DIVES FORWARD AND EXTENDS HIS HAND.  TOO LATE.
     THE VINYL SURROUNDS THE SCREAMING RICH GUY, SUCKS HIM
     BELOW THE SURFACE.  SMOTHERS HIM.

     DRAGS HIM TO THE BOTTOM.  MURTAUGH LOOKS ON, WILD-EYED.
     ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL IS A VINYL TOMB.  MURTAUGH
     DIVES IN. SWIMS TO THE  BOTTOM.  YANKS,  AND  STRAINS,  BUT
     WE ALL KNOW IT'S NO FUCKING USE.  THE  VINYL  STOPS  MOVING.
     MURTAUGH STARES... AND THEN HE GIVES  UP.  SURFACES  AT  THE
     SIDE OF THE POOL, GASPING AND WHEEZING.  RIGGS KNEELS
     DOWN BESIDE HIM.

                         RIGGS
               OOPS.

     MURTAUGH STARES DAGGERS AT HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               HAVE YOU ... EVER...  MET SOMEONE
               YOU DIDN'T KILL... ?

                         RIGGS
               HAVEN'T KILLED YOU YET.

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC, YOU WANT  A  LITTLE  GOLD
               STAR?
                    (LIE PULLS OUT
                     A SOAKED PACK
                     OF CIGARETTES)
               SHIT.

58   EXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOME - LATER                       58

     BEHIND RIGGS AND MURTAUGH, CRIME SCENE COPS SCURRY BACK
     AND FORTH.  FLASHING LIGHTS.  CAMERAS.  MURTAUGH MAKES
     HIS WAY TO THE CAR.  RIGGS BESIDE HIM.  AS THEY REACH
     THE CAR, MURTAUGH  STOPS:

                         MURTAUGH
               LOOK, I' M SORRY I SAID THAT SHIT
               BACK THERE.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU SAVED MY LIFE.  THANK YOU.

                         RIGGS
               I BET THAT HURT TO SAY.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

59   INT. MURTAUGH HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT                      59

     THE TWO DETECTIVES COME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR, SHEDDING
     THEIR JACKETS.  YOUNG CARRIE APPEARS, NURSING A POPSICLE.

                         CARRIE
               HI, DADDY.  IS THAT A CROOK?

                         MURTAUGH
               NO, HONEY, THIS IS MARTIN, MY
               PARTNER.
                    (SCOOPS HER UP;
                     HUGS HER)
               TELL MARTIN WHAT YOU THINK OF
               CROOKS.

                         CARRIE
               BUTTHEADS.
                    (GIGGLES)
               THEY'RE BUTTHEADS.

                         RIGGS
               KID'S NO DUMMY.

                         CARRIE
               DADDY, MOMMY SAYS YOU HATE HER
               COOKING.

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL MOMMY HATE IS A MILD WORD.

60   INT. KITCHEN                                               60

     TRISH IS COOKING AS THE TWO COPS ENTER.

                         MURTAUGH
               HI, HONEY.
                    (HE  LOOKS  IN
                     THE OVEN)
               WE'RE HAVING SOMETHING BROWN... A
               LARGISH BROWN OBJECT  ...

                         TRISH
               IT'S ROAST.

                         MURTAUGH
               DAMMIT, I WANTED TO GUESS.  HONENY,
               THIS IS MARTIN, MY NEW PARTNER.
               HE'LL BE JOINING US TONIGHT, OKAY?

                         TRISH
               SURE.  ROAST OKAY WITH YOU, MARTIN?

                         RIGGS
               FINE.

                         MURTAUGH
               HOW ABOUT BROWN, ROAST-LIKE
               SUBSTANCE?

                         TRISH
               ROGER, YOU'RE BEING AN ASSHOLE.
                    (KISSES  HIS  EAR)
               DON'T FORGET TO COMPLIMENT RIANNE
               ON HER SHOES.

                         MURTAUGH
               GOT  IT.  DRINK,  MARTIN?

                         RIGGS
               BOURBON, IF YOU HAVE IT.

     MURTAUGH EXITS.  RIGGS STANDS AWKWARDLY AS TRISH  REMOVES
     THE ROAST  FROM  THE  OVEN.

                         RIGGS
               MY WIFE COULD BURN WATER.

                         TRISH
               YOU'RE MARRIED?

                         RIGGS
               I WAS.  SHE'S  DEAD  NOW.

                         TRISH
               OH.  I'M SORRY.

                         RIGGS
               NO PROBLEM.

     HE REACHES FOR A STRAY PIECE OF ROAST.  TRISH SLAPS HIS
     HAND.

                         TRISH
               DON'T PICK.-

     RIGGS SMILES.  A GENUINE SMILE, THE FIRST WE'VE SEEN.

60A  INT. LIVING  ROOM  -  SAME                                   60A

     MURTAUGH IS FIXING DRINKS AS RIANNE ENTERS.  WE ALL
     HEAVE A SIGH.  SHE IS STRICTLY TO PERISH FOR.

                         RIANNE
               HELLO,   FATHER.

                         MURTAUGH
               HELLO, DAUGHTER.  NICE SHOES.

                         RIANNE
               OH, DADDY, AREN'T THEY GREAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               ABSOLUTELY.  HOW MUCH THEY COST?

                         RIANNE
               A HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS.  DO
               YOU REALLY LIKE THEM?

                         MURTAUGH
               A HUNDRED AND --
                   (FROWNS)
               -- THEY'RE SHOES.

                         RIANNE
               RIGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU WEAR THEM ON YOUR FEET.

                         RIANNE
               RIGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               AND THAT'S ALL THEY DO ... ?  THERE'S
               NOT, LIKE A TV INSIDE?

                         RIANNE
               NOPE.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (SHAKES HIS HEAD)
               I'M VERY OLD.

     YOUNG NICK MURTAUGH IS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE TELE-
     VISION, WATCHING A "CHARLEY BROWN CHRISTMAS" AND COLOR-
     ING A PICTURE WITH A BIG BOX OF CRAYONS.  HE STOPS.
     FROWNS.  LOOKS UP -- AT MARTIN RIGGS, WHO IS PEEKING
     HIS HEAD AROUND THE CORNER, WATCHING WITH RAPT FASCINA-
     TION.  RIGGS CHUCKLES, POINTS TO THE SCREEN:

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS GOOD.  I LIKE THIS.

     NICK LOOKS AT HIM VERY STRANGELY.  OKAY, SO THE GUY
     LIKES CARTOONS ...

62   INT. DINING ROOM - MEALTIME                                62

     EVERYONE IS GATHERED, EATING.
     INCREDIBLY HOMEY AND DOMESTIC-LOOKING.
     FOR RIGGS, WHO EATS RAVENOUSLY, IT IS THE FIRST TASTE
     OF WARMTH IN MANY A LONG YEAR.

62A  ACROSS THE TABLE                                          62A

     WE NOTICE SOMETHING KIND OF NEAT:
     RIANNE SIMPLY CANNOT TAKE HER EYES OFF RIGGS.
     SHE STARES AT HIM, IN A TRANCE.  HER BROTHER NICK NUDGES
     HER IN THE RIBS.  SHE PULLS A FACE.

62B  MURTAUGH                                                  62B

     HAS ALSO NOTICED HIS DAUGHTER'S ATTENTIONS, AND YOU CAN
     BET HE'S NOT ALL THAT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

63.  EXT. MURTAUGH'S HOIJSE - DRIVEWAY - BOAT - NIGHT           63

     TIRSH MURTAUGH WHEELING GARBAGE PAIL TO CURBSIDE.

                         TRISH
                    (SARCASTICALLY)
               THAT'S OKAY, HONEY.  I'LL TAKE
               OUT THE GARBAGE.

     BOAT.  MURTAUGH'S HEAD APPEARS SHEEPISHLY FROM WITHIN.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  THANKS, HONEY.

     ON BOARD BOAT, MURTAUGH IS WORKING ON THE ENGINE.  RIGGS
     SITTING ON DRIVER'S SEAT.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHADDAYA THINK?

                         RIGGS
               YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BOATS,
               ROGER?

                         MURTAUGH
               KNOW HOW MUCH THEY COST.

                         RIGGS
               I MEAN, CAN YOU SAIL THIS THING?

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S  WRONG  WITH  YOU?  THIS  AIN'T
               A SAIL BOAT.

                         RIGGS
                    (SMILING)
               THAT'S  WHAT  I  THOUGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               NO TRICK  TO  IT.  THAT'S  THE  FRONT.
               THAT'S THE BACK.  WATER ALL AROUND.
               WHY YOU GOTTA MAKE THINGS SO
               COMPLICATED?

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T.  THAT'S JUST HOW THEY ARE.

     MURTAUGH OPENS AN ICE CHEST, TAKES A BEER FOR HIMSELF
     AND TOSSES  ONE  TO  RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, YEAH.  YOU MEAN AMANDA
               HUNSACKER'S    MURDER?

                         RIGGS
               NOW, DID I MENTION THAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU DON'T HAVE TO.  I CAN READ
               YOUR MIND.

     RIGGS MAKES NO REPLY.  HE JUST LOOKS AT MURTAUGH OVER
     THE RIM OF  HIS  BEER  CAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               I DON'T GET YOU, RIGGS.  WHAT'S THE
               PROBLEM? WE  GOT  ONE  DEAD  GIRL  AND
               ONE DEAD  GUY.  DEAD  GUY  KILLED  THE
               DEAD GIRL AND WE KILLED THE DEAD
               GUY 'CAUSE HE WANTED  US  TO  BE  DEAD
               GUYS.  SEEMS PRETTY EASY TO ME.

     RIGGS HAS WANDERED OVER TO THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  HE IN-
     SPECTS THE SWITCHES AND GAUGES.

                         MURTAUGH
               LOOK, HER SUGAR DADDY WAS DEALIN'
               DRUGS.  SHE SAID SOMETHIN'... OR
               DID SOMETHIN'... OR SAW SOMETHIN'
               SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE, AND HE PITCHED
               HER OFF THE BALCONY INTO THE SWEET
               BY-AN'-BY.
                    (BEAT)
               THAT'S WHY HE CAME  AT  US  TODAY
               WITH A SHOTGUN.

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T  KNOW.  SOUNDS  A  LITTLE
               TOO NEAT TO ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               OF COURSE IT'S NEAT.  AND WHAT'S
               WRONG WITH  NEAT?  I  LIKE  NEAT.

     RIGGS FLIPS A SWITCH AND THE MOTOR ROARS TO LIFE.
     MURTAUGH LEAPS UP.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY!  WATCH  WHAT  YOU'RE  DOIN'!

     MURTAUGH FUMBLES WITH THE SWITCHES IN A FUTILE EFFORT  TO
     TURN OFF THE ENGINE.  BUT RIGGS KNOWS EXACTLY WHICH
     SWITCH TO FLIP.

                         RIGGS
               LOOKIN' FOR THIS?

     HE SILENCES THE ENGINE.  MURTAUGH GLARES AT HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU ASSHOLE.

                         RIANNE
               HI, DAD...

     MURTAUGH JUMPS, STARTLED BY HIS DAUGHTER'S ARRIVAL.
     RIANNE AND RIGGS EXCHANGE A GLANCE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT IS  IT,  RIANNE?

                         RIANNE
               MARK WANTS TO TAKE ME  OUT  TO  A
               CLUB TOMORROW NIGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE GROUNDED -- YOU KNOW THAT.

                         RIANNE
               PLEASE, DADDY ...

                         MURTAUGH
               WHICH ONE IS MARK, ANYWAY?

                         RIANNE
               THE BLOND ONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, YEAH. THE  ONE  WITH  PITS  IN
               HIS  FACE.

                         RIANNE
               THOSE ARE DIMPLES.

                         MURTAUGH
               THOSE ARE PITS.  WHEN HE SMILES,
               I CAN SEE THROUGH HIS HEAD.
                    (BEAT)
               THE ANSWER IS NO.  END OF STORY.

                         RIGGS
               C'MON, ROG.  HAVE A HEART.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT RIGGS -- NOT APPRECIATIVE OF HIS
     INTERVENTION.

                         MURTAUGH
               THE GIRL WAS SMOKING  POT  IN  THE
               HOUSE.  SHE'S GROUNDED!

                        RIANNE
               NEXT TIME I'LL JUST  TAKE  A  BEER
               INSTEAD.  WHY CAN I HAVE  A  BEER
               AND NOT  A JOINT?  IT'S NOT COKE,
               YOU  KNOW, DAD.

     MURTAUGH  LOOKS  DOWN SHEEPISHLY AT THE CAN OF BEER IN HIS
     HAND.  RIGGS  GRINS  TO  HIMSELF.

                         MURTAUGH
               'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, BEER'S LEGAL AND
               GRASS AIN'T.  RIGHT OR WRONG.

                         RIANNE
               WRONG.

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.

     SHE STALKS OFF.  AFTER A MOMENT, MURTAUGH LOOKS OVER TO
     RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'VE LOST TRACK... DID WE RESOLVE
               ANYTHING  HERE  TONIGHT?

     RIGGS SHAKES HIS HEAD, SMILES AND STARTS TO CLIMB OFF
     THE BOAT.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.  WE RESOLVED THAT YOUR WIFE
               TAKES OUT  THE  GARBAGE.  YOUR
               DAUGHTER SMOKES POT, WHICH IS
               ILLEGAL BUT SHOULDN'T BE -- THAT
               YOU DON'T KNOW FROM BOATS, AND
               YOU GOT ONE HELL OF A FAMILY, GUY.

     WALKING TOWARDS TRUCK TOGETHER.

                         MURTAUGH
               THANKS.

                         RIGGS
               ENJOYED THE MEAL.

                         MURTAUGH
               BULLSHIT, BUT  THANKS  ANYWAY.

     A PAUSE.   RIGGS STANDS THERE.  THEN:

                         RIGGS
               YOU DON'T TRUST ME AT ALL, DO YOU?

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL YOU WHAT.  MAKE IT THROUGH
               TOMORROW WITHOUT KILLING ANYBODY.
               ESPECIALLY  ME.  OR  YOURSELF.
               THEN I'LL START TRUSTING YOU.

                         RIGGS
               FAIR ENOUGH.

     HE WALKS TOWARD HIS TRUCK.  STOPS.

                         RIGGS
               I DO IT REAL GOOD,  YOU  KNOW.

                         MURTAUGH
               DO WHAT?

                         RIGGS
               KILL PEOPLE ... ONLY THING I EVER
               DID GOOD.  WHEN I WAS NINETEEN, I
               DID A GUY IN LAOS FROM A THOUSAND
               YARDS OUT.
               RIFLE SHOT IN HIGH WIND.
                    (BEAT)
               TEN GUYS IN THE WORLD COULDA MADE
               THAT SHOT.  HUH.  ONLY THING I WAS
               EVER GOOD AT.
                    (PAUSE;  THEN)
               WELL, SEE YOU TOMORROW.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  SEE  YOU  THEN.

     RIGGS DRIVES  AWAY.  MURTAUGH  WATCHES  HIM.  TURNS.  ON  THE
     WAY BACK INSIDE, HE FLICKS ON THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

64   OMITTED                                                        64

65   EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT                                      65

     MARTIN RIGGS CRUISES ALONG IN HIS BATTERED PICKUP TRUCK
     PAST ALL-NIGHT DIVES AND PORNO HOUSES.  THE STREETS ARE
     NEARLY DESERTED.  EXCEPT FOR A YOUNG HOOKER ON THE COR-
     NER.  REAL YOUNG, MAYBE SEVENTEEN.  RIGGS SEES HER AND
     PULLS OVER TO THE CURB.  THE HOOKER APPROACHES.

                         HOOKER
               HI, HANDSOME.  LOOKING FOR
               SOMETHING?

                         RIGGS
               AREN'T  WE  ALL?

                         HOOKER
                    (NODS)
               ARE YOU AFFILIATED WITH ANY LAW
               ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION?

                         RIGGS
                    (PAUSE;  THEN)
               NO. GET  IN  THE  CAR.

     SHE DOES.  CLOSES THE DOOR.

                         RIGGS
               HOW OLD ARE YOU?

                         HOOKER
               TWENTY-TWO.

                         RIGGS
               BULLSHIT.

                         HOOKER
               WHY, YOU LIKE 'EM YOUNG?

                         RIGGS
               YOUNGER THE BETTER.  HOW OLD ARE
               YOU?

                         HOOKER
                    (ALMOST SHYLY)
               SIXTEEN.

     RIGGS NODS.  TAKES OUT A HUNDRED-DOLLAR BILL AND SETS IT
     IN HER  LAP.

                         HOOKER
               WOW.
                    (BEAT)
               SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

                         RIGGS
               I WANT YOU TO COME HOME AND
               WATCH TELEVISION WITH ME.

     HE DRIVES AWAY FROM THE CURB.

66   INT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT                                 66

     THE HOUSE IS DARK AND QUIET AT THIS HOUR.  ROGER MURTAUGH
     FIXES A SANDWICH IN THE KITCHEN.  RICKLES THE CAT PURRS,
     RUBS AGAINST HIS LEG.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY.

     HE KICKS IT ASIDE.  NOTICES A PACKAGE ON THE COUNTER,
     TOGETHER WITH A SCRIBBLED CRAYON NOTE:

     HAPPY BIRTHDAY SERGEANT MURTAUGH

     THE GIFT IS A 99C SPECIAL, RIGHT OFF THE RACK AT PIC N'
     SAVE:  THE TUFF N' READY POLICE ACTION PLAYSET; TINY
     PLASTIC GUN, MADE IN TAIWAN.  TINY PLASTIC BADGE.

     HE OPENS THE PACKAGE. TWO  THINGS:  A  HIGH  SCHOOL  YEAR-
     BOOK; ALSO A VIDEOCASSETTE. TAKES IT,  SLIDES  IT  INTO  A
     VCR MACHINE.  TURNS ON THE TELEVISION.

                                          TIME CUT  TO:

67A  INT./EXT. RIGGS' TRAILER - NIGHT                             67A

     THE HOOKER WATCHES TV -- REALLY ENJOYING THE THREE
     STOOGES. RIGGS STANDS APART  FROM  HER.  HE'S  NOT  WATCH-
     ING TV; HE'S WATCHING HER WATCHING TV.

     HE WEARS A MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION. THE  WORLD  IS  FULL  OF
     HAPPY FAMILIES LIKE MURTAUGH'S, BUT HE HAS TO GET BY
     LIKE THIS.

     HIS EYES SHIFT TO A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE.  HE PICKS IT UP
     AND VIEWS IT SADLY.

                         HOOKER
                    (TURNING TO HIM)
               YOU'RE NOT HAVING A VERY GOOD
               TIME,  ARE  YOU?

     RIGGS PUTS DOWN THE PHOTO.

                         RIGGS
                    (SWEETLY)
               YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.  MAYBE THIS
               IS HOW I LOOK WHEN I'M HAVING A
               GOOD TIME.  MAYBE I'M HAVING THE
               BEST TIME OF MY LIFE.

                         HOOKER
                    (AFTER A BEAT)
               ARE YOU?

     RIGGS DOESN'T ANSWER.

                         HOOKER
               I KNOW... SING ME SOMETHING.

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T SING.

                         HOOKER
               COME ON.  SING ME A SONG.

                         RIGGS
               I DON'T KNOW ANY SONGS.

                         HOOKER
               NOT EVEN A CHRISTMAS SONG?
               EVERYBODY KNOWS A CHRISTMAS SONG.

     RIGGS SHRUGS AND MAKES A HALF-HEARTED ATTEMPT:

                         RIGGS
               SOMETHING THROUGH THE SNOW,
               IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH ...

                         HOOKER
               GOOD.  THAT'S   GOOD.
                    (HELPS HIM OUT)
               OVER THE HILLS WE GO,
               LAUGHING ALL THE WAY.

                         RIGGS
               SOMETHING SOMETHING RING,
               MAKING SOMETHING BRIGHT ...

                         HOOKER
               OH, WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE ...

                         RIGGS
               TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE TONIGHT!

     THEY KNOW THEY GOT IT WRONG,  BUT  THEY'RE  PLEASED  WITH
     THEMSELVES JUST THE SAME.  THE HOOKER HUGS RIGGS IMPUL-
     SIVELY.  RIGGS LOOKS UNCOMFORTABLE.  HE'D LIKE TO SHOW
     HER SOME PLATONIC AFFECTION, BUT HE KNOWS THAT'S
     IMPOSSIBLE.

     HE GENTLY UNWRAPS HER ARMS FROM AROUND HIS NECK.

                         RIGGS
               I BETTER TAKE YOU BACK NOW.

68   SAME PLACE - LITTLE  BIT  LATER                                 68

     MURTAUGH IS IN FRONT OF THE TV. ON  HIS  LAP  IS  A  HIGH
     SCHOOL YEARBOOK.  OPEN TO THE MIDDLE.  HE GLANCES DOWN,
     SEES -- A PHOTOGRAPH OF AMANDA LLOYD.  SENIOR PICTURE.
     SMILING.  YOUNG.  THE GIRL MOST LIKELY TO.  HE LOOKS UP
     UP AT THE TELEVISION.  ON THE SCREEN AMANDA LLOYD IS
     WRITHING  IN  ECSTASY.  SMILING.  MURTAUGH  CONTINUES  TO
     WATCH.  LIGHTS ANOTHER CIGARETTE.  THERE IS A SAD,
     FARAWAY LOOK ON HIS FACE.

69   INT. HALLWAY                                                    69

     VERY LATE NOW. MURTAUGH WALKS DOWN  THE  HALL  TO  A  BEDROOM
     DOOR.  OPENS IT A FRACTION.  INSIDE -- HIS DAUGHTER
     RIANNE IS ASLEEP.

     A SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT FALLS ACROSS THE BED.  SHE IS MORE
     BEAUTIFUL THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN HER.

     MURTAUGH CROSSES TO THE BED, LEANS DOWN, AND KISSES  HER
     FOREHEAD.  SHE STIRS IN HER SLEEP, SMILES LIKE A CAT,
     AND WHISPERS:

                         RIANNIE
               ... MARK ...

     MURTAUGH RECOILS. STANDS UP. WE REALIZE  THAT  UP  UNTIL
     THIS MOMENT, SEE, HE THOUGHT SHE WAS MAYBE A VIRGIN ...

70   INT. MURTAUGH'S BEDROOM                                    70

     HE TAKES OFF HIS ROBE, DRAPES IT ON A CHAIR.  GETS  INTO
     BED SILENTLY NEXT TO HIS SLEEPING WIFE.  LIES AWAKE,
     STARING UP AT THE CEILING.  THE RAIN BEATS ON THE WINDOW,
     THROWING ODD SHADOWS ACROSS HIS FACE. HE  DRIFTS  TOWARD
     SLEEP.  AS HE DOES, WE EVER SO SLOWLY ...

                                            CROSS FADE TO:

71   INT. MURTAUGH BEDROOM                                      71

     SUNLIGHT STREAMS THROUGH THE WINDOWS, MURTAUGH STIRS
     GROGGILY, FORCES OPEN HIS EYES.  STARING HIM IN THE FACE
     IS MARTIN RIGGS' SCRUFFY, EARLY MORNING  FACE.  MURTAUGH
     FROWNS.

                         MURTAUGH
               ... MARTIN...  ?

                         RIGGS
               GOOD MORNING, ROGER.  I'VE BEEN
               DOING A LITTLE THINKING.

     MURTAUGH JUST STARES AT HIM.

                         RIGGS
               ABOUT THE NIGHT AMANDA HUNSAK.ER
               DIED.

     MURTAUGH GRIMACES.

                         MURTAUGH
               DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS ... ?

                         RIGGS
               DAY TIME?

                         MURTAUGH
               I'LL GET DRESSED.

72   INT. MURTAUGH KITCHEN                            72

     IN THE KITCHEN TRISH IS SINGING SOMETHING BLUESY, FIXING
     COFFEE.  AT THE TABLE NICK IS DRINKING MILK.  MURTAUGH
     SITS.  RIGGS TAKES OFF HIS SHOULDER HOLSTER, AND WITH
     METICULOUS CARE DRAPES IT DELICATELY OVER THE BACK OF
     HIS CHAIR.  SITS OPPOSITE MURTAUGH.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE SERIOUSLY USING KETCHUP?

                         MURTAUGH

               RIGHT, AND SHE'S IN CENTURY CITY
               WITNESSING AMANDA HUNSAKER'S SUICIDE

                         MURTAUGH
               OR MURDER --

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT, OR MURDER, AND MY QUESTION
               IS... WHAT IS SHE DOING THERE?  I
               CALLED WILSHIRE VICE, THAT'S NOT
               HER USUAL TURF.

                         MURTAUGH
               WOW.
                    (BEAT)
               WOW.  THAT'S REALLY REACHING.

               I'M HAVING  A  HUNCH.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU COULDN'T HAVE IT AT HOME, YOU
               HAD TO COME HERE AT 7:30 A.M. AND
               HAVE IT.

               7:35, AND YES, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
               EXCITED.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M THRILLED.
                    (PAUSE)
               OKAY.

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY, GO FOR IT.  I'M LISTENING.

73   INT. OUTDOOR FIRING PANGE - DAY                   73

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH STAND ON LINE AT THE RANGE.  AROUND
     THEM THE ECHOING BOOM OF GUNSHOTS FILLS THE MORNING AIR.
     THEY STRUGGLE TO BE HEARD OVER THE TUMULT:

                         MURTAUGH
               WE KNOW SOMEONE WAS IN BED WITH
               AMANDA LLOYD THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.   'TIL NOW WE ASSUMED IT WAS
               A MAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY.  LET'S SAY IT WAS DIXIE.

                         RIGGS
               OKAY.  DISGUSTING,   BUT   OKAY:   LET'S
               SAY  DIXIE  SLIPPED  THE  DRAIN  CLEANER
               INTO THE PILLS.

                         MURTAUGH
               SAY SOMEONE PAID HER TO DO IT.

                         RIGGS
               SURE.  SHE  THINKS,   TERRIFIC,   AMANDA
               SWALLOWS  A  COUPLE  DOWNERS  AND  BOOM,
               SHE'S DEAD.  THEN DIXIE --

                         MURTAUGH
               IF IT WAS HER --

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT, RIGHT, THEN DIXIE HAS
               PLENTY OF TIME TO SPRITZ THE PLACE
               UP, GET OUT, WHATEVER.

                         MURTAUGH
               EXCEPT AMANDA JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.

                         RIGGS
               OR DIXIE PUSHES HER.  EITHER WAY

                         MURTAUGH
               EITHER WAY, SHE'S GOTTA MAKE A
               FAST GETAWAY, 'CAUSE NOW THE
               BODY'S PUBLIC.  SHE HAULS ASS
               DOWNSTAIRS.

                         RIGGS
               PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT TO SEE WHAT
               HAPPENED.

                         MURTAUGH
               SOMEONE SPOTS HER.  SHE SAYS 'SHIT.'

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.  SHE ACTUALLY STOPS AND
               SAYS, 'SHIT.'

                         MURTAUGH
               OR, 'DAMN.'

                         RIGGS
               OR 'GOLLY, I'VE BEEN SPOTTED.'
               THE POINT BEING --

                         MURTAUGH
               THE POINT BEING, NOW SHE HAS TO
               COVER HER ASS.

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.  SO SHE SAYS, 'OFFICER,
               OFFICER, I SAW THE WHOLE THING.'

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGHT.

                         RIGGS
               RIGHT.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (SIGHS)
               THAT'S PRETTY FUCKING THIN.

                         RIGGS
               VERY THIN.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (SMILES)
               HELL WITH IT.  THIN'S MY MIDDLE
               NAME.

                         RIGGS
               YOUR WIFE'S COOKING, I'M NOT
               SURPRISED.

                         MURTAUGH
               WOULD YOU LAY OFF THE COOKING?

                         RIGGS
               TELL HER THAT.

     RIGGS STEPS TO THE LINE.  DRAWS THE BERETTA, FIRES OFF
     A FULL CLIP.  THREE-SHOT RHYTHMS, TWO IN THE CHEST, ONE
     IN THE HEAD, TWO IN THE CHEST, ONE IN THE HEAD.
     REMOVES THE MAGAZINES LOVINGLY SNAPS IN A NEW ONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU SLEEP WITH THAT THING UNDER
               YOUR PILLOW?

                         RIGGS
               I WOULD IF I SLEPT.

                         MURTAUGH
               HERE, STAND BACK.

     MURTAUGH STEPS TO THE RED LINE.  STRETCHES.  CRACKS HIS
     NECK.  SHIFTS FROM FOOT TO FOOT.  FINALLY STEADIES HIM-
     SELF.  A MOMENT THEN:  HE CROSS-DRAWS WITH LIGHTNING
     SWIFTNESS.  -- BANG -- !  THE REPORT IS DEAFENING.  THE
     TARGET GROWS A NEAT THIRD EYE.  PERFECT SHOT.  DEAD
     CENTER.  MURTAUGH GRINS, HOLSTERS HIS GUN.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY-HEY.  WOULD'JA LOOK AT THAT?
               PRETTY GOOD FOR AN OLD MAN.

     RIGGS SHRUGS.  DRAWS.  FIRES.  HE ISN'T EVEN LOOKING.

     NONETHELESS. -- HE PUTS A MAGNUM ROUND RIGHT THROUGH
     THE HOLE MADE BY MURTAUGH'S .38.  THE HOLE GETS .60
     INCHES WIDER.  MURTAUGH SCOWLS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH, YEAH.  EAT ME.

     HE STALKS AWAY, PISSED OFF.

75   EXT. WEST L.A. STREET - MORNING                           75

     MURTAUGH'S CAR GLIDES UP TO THE CURB.  IN FRONT OF A
     ROW OF NEAT FRAME HOUSES.  OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.  LATE MODEL
     CARS.  A LITTLE BLACK KID PLAYING ON THE SIDEWALK.

     THE TWO COPS GET OUT, STRIDE TOWARD A  COTTAGE  SET  BACK
     FROM THE STREET.  THEY PASS THE LITTLE KID WHO IS PLAYING
     WITH A PLASTIC BUCKET AND A HEADLESS  STAR  WARS  FIGURE.

                         RIGGS
               HEY, KID.  WHAT'CHA DOING?

     THE KID GRINS, OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF.

                         LITTLE KID
               I PUT THIS ON TOP AND IT FALL
               DOWN.

     HE DEMONSTRATES.  HE PUTS IT  ON  TOP.  IT  FALLS  DOWN.  HE
     GRINS HAPPILY.  RIGGS SHAKES HIS HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               GOOD THINKING.

     THEY KEEP WALKING.  TOWARD THE COTTAGE.

                         MURTAUGH
               VERY THIN.

                         RIGGS
               PROBABLY NOTHING.

     THEY MOUNT THE STEPS TO THE WALK.  AS THEY DO -- THE
     HOUSE SUDDENLY EXPLODES.  IT  BLOWS  APART  CONCUSSIVELY.
     THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT, A LOUD, FLAT BANG --!  AND THE
     THING TEARS TO PIECES.  GLASS  BLOWS  OUT.  WOOD  SPRAYS.
     FLYING SHRAPNEL.  A WALL OF  FLAME.  RIGGS  HITS  THE  DIRT,
     SMOTHERING THE LITTLE BLACK KID.  MURTAUGH DIVES FOR COVER
     BEHIND A TELEPHONE POLE. A PIECE  OF  SHRAPNEL  IMBEDS  IT-
     SELF; RIGHT NEXT TO HIS HEAD.  CARNAGE.  NOISE.  THE
     TUMULT SLOWLY BEGINS TO  FADE.  ECHOES.  FLAMES  RAGE  TO
     THE SKY.  SMOKE ROLLS.  BEAMS COLLAPSE.  THE COTTAGE IS
     NO MORE.  MURTAUGH CLIMBS TO HIS FEET, DAZED; STARES AT
     THE RUBBLE.  LOOKS OVER TOWARD RIGGS, WHO IS GETTING
     UP OFF THE KID.  THE KID IS SHAKEN, BUT UNHURT.

                         MURTAUGH
               HEY.

     RIGGS TURNS.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE ON FIRE.

     RIGGS LOOKS. THE BACK OF HIS  COAT  IS  COMPLETELY  ABLAZE.

                         RIGGS
               SHIT.

     HE TAKES IT OFF, FLINGS IT ASIDE.

     GOES UP TO MURTAUGH-  LIGHTS A CIGARETTE.

                         RIGGS
               PROBABLY NOTHING.

                         MURTAUGH
               THIN.  VERY THIN.

76   EXT. BURNED-OUT COTTAGE - LATER                            76

     COPS PROWL THROUGH THE GUTTED REMAINS.  CHARRED AND
     BLACK. NOTHING LEFT.  A BODY GOES BY ON A STRETCHER.
     MURTAUGH STOPS IT.

                         MURTAUGH
               HO.
                    (HE  LOOKS  UNDER
                     THE SHEET)
               JESUS.

                         ATTENDANT
               WE'RE HOPING TO FIND SOME TEETH.
               IN THERE.  OTHERWISE, COULD BE
               ANYBODY.  BLACK, WHITE ... COULD
               BE A FUCKIN' BOWL OF SOUP, FOR
               ALL WE --

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY, OKAY.

     THE STRETCHER CONTINUES TOWARD THE WAITING TRUCK.
     MURTAUGH LOOKS OFF,  WHISPERS:

                         MURTAUGH
               BYE-BYE, DIXIE.

     MARTIN RIGGS IS EXAMINING A TWISTED HUNK OF METAL AS
     MURTAUGH WALKS UP BESIDE  HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'CHA GOT?

                         RIGGS
               PART OF THE  DEVICE.
                    (BEAT)
               HOLY COW.

                         MURTAUGH

                         RIGGS
               ARTWORK.  THIS IS GODDAMN ARTWORK.

                         MURTAUGH
               SWELL.  I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT.

                         RIGGS
               YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.  THIS IS REAL
               PRO STUFF.  HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SINCE ...
               WELL, SINCE THE WAR.

                         MURTAUGH
               COME AGAIN?

                         RIGGS
               C.I.A. USED TO HIRE MERCS WHO USED
               THIS SAME SETUP.  MERCURY SWITCHES.

     MURTAUGH FROWNS.  A PATROL COP TAPS HIM ON THE SHOULDER.

                         PATROL COP
               SIR, I THINK YOU'D BETTER COME
               WITH ME.

     RIGGS-AND MURTAUGH EXCHANGE GLANCES.  THEY MOVE OFF,
     ACROSS THE STREET.

78   EXT. STREET - BACK OF FIRE  TRUCK                       78

     RIGGS AND MURTAUGH STAND BY THE REAR OF THE TRUCK.  A
     CONSTRUCTION CREW WATCHES FROM BEHIND, HEAVY EQUIPMENT
     IDLING SOFTLY.  NEXT TO THEM SITS THE LITTLE BLACKKID
     FROM EARLIER, COLORING WITH CRAYONS.  HIS MOTHER
     HOVERS ...

                         COP
               OKAY, HERE IT IS.  THE LITTLE  KID
               SAYS HE SAW SOMEONE WORKING ON
               THE METER THIS MORNING.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHERE?

                         COP
               ACROSS THE STREET AT  DIXIE'S.  HE
               WAS PLAYIN' SOME KIND OF GAME,
               HIDIN' UNDER THE STAIRS.  SAYS  HE
               SAW THE GUY PRETTY GOOD.

                         MURTAUGH
               JESUS.  THIS COULD BE A BREAK.

                         RIGGS
               YOU KIDDING? THE KID'S  SIX  YEARS
               OLD.

                         COP
               IF THAT.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU CALL THE GAS COMPANY?

                         COP
               SURE DID.  NO ONE SUPPOSED TO
               CHECK THAT METER FOR AT LEAST
               ANOTHER   MONTH.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (NODS)
               LET ME HANDLE THIS.

                         COP
               BE MY GUEST.

                         RIGGS
               WANNA WEAR THE CHICKEN SUIT?  I GOT
               SOME CLOWN MAKEUP.

                         MURTAUGH
               STOW IT.

     HE CROSSES TO THE BOY.

                         MURTAUGH
               HI.  I'M DETECTIVE MURTAUGH.  WHAT'S
               YOUR NAME?

                         ALFRED (LITTLE KID)
               ALFRED.

     HE STARES AT MURTAUGH WITH EYES LIKE SAUCERS.

                         MURTAUGH
               HOW OLD ARE YOU, ALFRED?

                         ALFRED
               SIX.

                         MURTAUGH
               WOW.  SIX.
                    (BEAT)
               BET YOU LIKE THE GOBOTS, HUH?

     ALFRED NODS.

                         MURTAUGH
               ME, I'M A G.I. JOE MAN.

                         ALFRED
                    (POINTS)
               IS THAT A REAL GUN?

                         MURTAUGH
               YES, IT IS.

                         ALFRED
               DO YOU KILL PEOPLE?

                         MURTAUGH
               NO.  IF A GUY IS HURTING SOMEONE,
               I TRY TO SHOOT HIM IN THE  ARM  OR
               SOMETHING.  JUST TO STOP HIM.

                         ALFRED
               MOMMA SAYS POLICEMAN  SHOOT  BLACK
               PEOPLE.

     MURTAUGH GRIMACES.  ALFRED'S MOTHER LOOKS AWAY QUICKLY.

                         MURTAUGH
               ALFRED, THIS MAN YOU SAW.  THE METER
               MAN ... ?
                    (BEAT)
               YOU GET A GOOD LOOK AT HIM?

                         ALFRED
               I SAW HIM.

                         MURTAUGH
               GREAT.  LISTEN, YOU EVER WATCH
               'STARSKY AND  HUTCH'?  'CAUSE  THE
               POLICE, SOMETIMES THEY NEED HELP.
               THEY NEED POLICE HELPERS.
               DETECTIVES.
                    (HE  TAKES  OUT
                     A PLASTIC BADGE,
                     PUTS IT ON
                     ALFRED'S CHEST)
               IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN BE  A  JUNIOR
               DETECTIVE.  IF YOU WANT.

     THE KID LOOKS  AT  HIM.  DISTRUST.

                         MURTAUGH
               KEEP IT, IT'S YOURS.  OFFICIAL
               DETECTIVE.

     ALFRED NODS, GRINS.

                         MURTAUGH
               THE MAN AT THE METER.  CAN YOU ...
               PICTURE HIM IN  YOUR  HEAD?  THINK
               ABOUT WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.  GOT
               IT ?

     ALFRED NODS.  MURTAUGH PICKS UP ALFRED'S BOX OF CRAYONS.
     HANDS IT TO THE LITTLE BOY.

                         MURTAUGH
               I WANT YOU TO DRAW HIM FOR ME.

                         ALFRED
               I'M A GOOD DRAWER.

                         MURTAUGH
               TRY TO DRAW THE MAN.

    RIGGS CLEARS HIS THROAT.  ROLLS HIS EYES.

                         RIGGS
               OH, BROTHER.  THIS IS GOOD.  I LIKE
               THIS.

                         MURTAUGH
               CAN IT, MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               WE'RE GONNA PUT OUT AN A.P.B. ON BIG
               BIRD.

                         MURTAUGH
               VERY FUNNY.

                         RIGGS
                    (LAUGHS)
               ATTENTION ALL UNITS.  LARGE YELLOW
               BIRD.   SILLY   VOICE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU'RE HILARIOUS.  ALFRED, DRAW THE
               MAN, OKAY?

     ALFRED NODS, TAKES THE CRAYONS, AND CAREFULLY SELECTS A
     BUNCH OF COLORS.  LAYS THEM OUT LIKE DA VINCI FIXING HIS
     PALETTE.  RIGGS  SHAKES   HIS   HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               BRILLIANT POLICE WORK?  I THINK SO.

                                               TIME CUT:

79   ANOTHER ANGLE                                          79

     MINUTES HAVE PASSED.

                         MURTAUGH
               MARTIN, HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

     RIGGS CROSSES.  ALFRED HAS FINISHED HIS DRAWING, AND
     GUESS WHAT?  IT'S HILARIOUSLY BAD.  LIKE A SIX-YEAR-OLD
     DREW IT OR SOMETHING.  RIGGS RUBS HIS EYES.

                         RIGGS
               OH, MY ...
                    (BEGINS TO
                     LAUGH)
               ... OH, MY...

     HE LAUGHS EVEN HARDER NOW.  MURTAUGH SCOWLS,
     SNATCHES THE PICTURE AWAY.

                         MURTAUGH
               TERRIFIC.  VERY PROFESSIONAL.

     RIGGS IS HOOTING.  MURTAUGH SHOWS THE PICTURE TO ALFRED.

                         ALFRED
               HE LAUGH AT MY PICTURE.

                         MURTAUGH
               SHHH.  DON'T MIND HIM.  HE'S
               CRAZY.

                         ALFRED
               I'M A GOOD DRAWER.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU BET.
                    (POINTS)
               ALFRED.  THIS IS ... THE MAN'S ARM,
               RIGHT?

                         ALFRED
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               OKAY.  NOW THIS MARK.  IS THIS ...
               WHAT IS THIS?

                         ALFRED
               HE HAD IT ON HIS ARM.

     RIGGS STOPS LAUGHING.  MOVES IN CLOSER.

                         RIGGS
               WHOA.  WHAT WAS ON HIS ARM?

                         MURTAUGH
               WAS IT A BIRTHMARK?
                    (POINTS TO
                      HIS ARM)
               WAS IT LIKE THIS?

                         ALFRED
               NO.  IT  WAS   PAINED.

                         MURTAUGH
               PAINED.

                         RIGGS
               PAINED, PAINED.  WHAT'S HE SAYING?

                         MURTAUGH
               SSSSHH.
                    (BEAT)
               IT WAS ... PAINTED?

                         ALFRED
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               LIKE  A  TATTOO?
                    (BEAT)
               DO YOU  WATCH  POPEYE?  WAS  IT  A
               TATTOO LIKE POPEYE HAS?

     RIGGS ROLLS UP HIS SLEEVE, EXPOSES HIS MARINE TATTOO.
     YOU'VE SEEN THE TYPE:  A TWEETY BIRD WITH A MACHINE GUN,
     OR SOME SUCH.

                         RIGGS
               THIS IS A TATTOO.

     THE BOY'S EYES GO WIDE ONCE AGAIN.  HE POINTS AT RIGGS' ARM.

                         ALFRED
               IT WAS THAT.

     THE  COPS  STOP,  PUZZLED.

                         MURTAUGH
               IT  WAS  THAT?  YOU  MEAN...  JUST
               LIKE  THAT...?

                         ALFRED
               YEAH.  MAN  HAD  THE  SAME  THING.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE SURE?

     ALFRED  NODS.  THE  COPS  EXCHANGE   GLANCES:

                         RIGGS
               SPECIAL FORCES TATTOO ... ?

                         MURTAUGH
               MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT THE HELL ARE WE INTO HERE ... ?

80   EXT. CLIFFSIDE HOUSE - DAY                                    80

     A SPRAWLING, EXPENSIVE VILLA NESTLED ON THE SIDE  OF  A
     BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE  OCEAN.  TERRACES,  VERANDAHS,
     GAZEBOS.  ARCHITECTURE THAT MERITS THREE SYLLABLES.  THE
     OCEAN LOOKS CHEAP BY COMPARISON.  A MEMORIAL SERVICE IS
     IN PROGRESS.  A GROUP OF PEOPLE, MOSTLY YOUNG, FRIENDS
     OF AMANDA LLOYD; ALL ARE DRESSED IN  FUNERAL  BLACK.

81   NEARBY --                                                    81

     MARTIN RIGGS IS COLLAPSED IN A LAWN  CHAIR,  SMOKING AND
     LOOKING THOROUGHLY OUT OF PLACE.  SEEING  THE  GIRL, HE
     FROWNS ... PUFFS ON HIS CIGARETTE, AND ROLLS A  QUARTER
     OVER HIS KNUCKLES LIKE A  STAGE  MAGICIAN.  NIMBLE,  TRAINED
     FINGERS.  A THOROUGHLY UNCONSCIOUS HABIT.

82   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 82

     DICK LLOYD LOOKS WORSE THAN EVER.  HE  STANDS,  STARING
     OUT OVER THE OCEAN -- AS A HAND COMES OUT OF NOWHERE ...
     GRABS HIS SHOULDER, AND SPINS HIM ROUGHLY AROUND:  FACE-
     TO-FACE WITH ROGER MURTAUGH.  EYES BURNING LIKE COLD FIRE.

                         MURTAUGH
               HI, GUY.

                         LLOYD
               ROGER... WHAT ... WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

                         MURTAUGH
               NOT MUCH.
                     (BEAT)
               WANNA TELL ME ABOUT IT?

                         LLOYD
               TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T BULLSHIT ME.  THAT'S OVER.
                    (BEAT)
               YOUR DAUGHTER WASN'T KILLED
               BECAUSE OF SOMETHING SHE WAS INTO.
               SHE WAS KILLED BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
               YOU'RE INTO.  STOP ME IF I'M WRONG.

                         LLOYD
               I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
               ABOUT.  ROGER, I ...

                         MURTAUGH
               KEEP YOUR HANDS IN FRONT.

                         LLOYD
                    (STOPS;
                     STARTLED)
               HEY.  TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

                         MURTAUGH
               FUCK EASY.
                    (BEAT)
               WHEN YOU CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY,
               YOU WERE GONNA BLOW THE WHISTLE,
               WEREN'T YOU?

                         LLOYD
               BLOW THE WHISTLE ON WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU TELL ME.  YOU WERE GONNA SPILL
               YOUR GUTS.  SO THEY KILLED YOUR
               DAUGHTER.  TELL ME I'M WRONG.

     LLOYD SWALLOWS HARD, FLUSTERED.  HE CAN'T MEET MURTAUGH'S
     EYES.

                         MURTAUGH
               TALK TO ME.

                         LLOYD
               CAN'T ... CAN'T DO THAT ...

                         MURTAUGH
               THEY KILLED YOUR DAUGHTER.

                         LLOYD
               I...

                        MURTAUGH
               THEY PAID OFF A HOOKER TO POISON
               YOUR DAUGHTER.  TALK TO ME!

     LLOYD SHOOTS A DESPERATE GLANCE ACROSS THE LAWN.  AT HIS
     OTHER DAUGHTER, AMANDA'S TWIN.

                         LLOYD
               DAMMIT,  ROGER,   I'VE...   VE  O
               ANOTHER DAUGHTER!

                         MURTAUH
               SHE'LL BE PROTECTED.
                    (BEAT)
               IT'S OVER, PAL.

                         LLOYD
               PROTECTED.  THAT'S A LAUGH... YOU
               DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

                         MURTAUGH
               ACQUAINT ME.

                                             TIME CUT:

83   INT. LLOYD'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                        83

     THE TWO MEN ARE INSIDE NOW.  THE SUNLIGHT FILTERS IN
     THROUGH A LARGE PICTURE WINDOW FROM THE LAWN.

     LLOYD IS PACING BACK AND FORTH.   HE TOUCHES HIS STOMACH
     IN THE CLASSIC GESTURE OF ULCER-CARRIERS EVERYWHERE.
     OPENS THE FRIDGE, REMOVES A CARTON OF MILK.  THERE MUST
     BE THREE CASES OF THE STUFF.  DRINKS, TURNS TO MURTAUGH.
     A MAN AT THE  END  OF  HIS  ROPE:

                         LLOYD
               IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE
               WAR.

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M   LISTENING.

                         LLOYD
               I ENDED UP WORKING FOR A GROUP
               CALLED AIR AMERICA.  C.I.A. FRONT,
               SECRETLY RAN THE ENTIRE WAR OUT OF
               LAOS.  I WAS PART OF A SPECIAL

                         LLOYD
               COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, SHADOW COMPANY
               GOT TOGETHER AGAIN.  THE  WAR  WAS
               OVER, BUT WE STILL HAD A  LIST  OF
               SOURCES.  IN ASIA.

                         MURTAUGH
               AND ... ?

                         LLOYD
               AND WE'VE BEEN BRINGING IT IN EVER
               SINCE.

                         MURTAUGH
               BRINGING WHAT IN?

                         LLOYD
               THINK REAL HARD.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU SON OF  A  BITCH.

     LLOYD DOES NOT REPLY.  A PAUSE, THEN:

                         MURTAUGH
               IF YOU WERE GETTING COLD FEET,
               WHY'D THEY KILL  AMANDA?  WHY  NOT
               JUST  KILL  YOU?

                         LLOYD
               THEY CAN'T.  THEY NEED ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHY?

                         LLOYD
               MY BANK.  IT'S  THE  FRONT.  MAKES
               EVERYTHING LOOK GOOD ON THE TAX
               REPORT.

                         MURTAUGH
               THE TAX REPORT ... ?

                         LLOYD
               THIS IS BIG BUSINESS, ROGER.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (ICE COLD)
               NOT ANY MORE.  I'M GONNA BURN
               IT DOWN.

                         LLOYD
               YOU CAN'T.  IT'S  TOO  BIG.  THESE
               GUYS ARE TRAINED KILLERS.

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL ME ABOUT THE  NEXT  SHIPMENT.

                         LLOYD
               NO.  NO WAY.

     MURTAUGH GRABS A FRAMED PICTURE OF AMANDA, SLAMS IT
     DOWN ON A WOODEN BUL--CHER BLOCK.  THE GLASS SHATTERS.
     LLOYD STARES.

                         MURTAUGH
               TELL ME!!!

     LLOYD FLINCHES.  LEANS BACK, A DREAMY LOOK IN HIS EYES.
     SPEAKS FROM VERY FAR AWAY ...

                         LLOYD
                    (SOFTLY)
               NOTHING ... WRONG WITH THE KIDS,
               ROGER. WE'RE  ALL  FUCKED  UP.  US
               OLD BASTARDS ... WE'RE KILLING THEM.

     AND SUDDENLY THERE IS A GUN IN HIS HAND.  AIMED AT MURTAUGH.

                         LLOYD
               BACK OFF.

                         MURTAUGH
               OH, SWELL.  GOOD MOVE.

                         LLOYD
               I'M NOT KIDDING. I'M  IN  TOO  FAR
               NOW.

     MURTAUGH DOES NOT BUDGE.  LLOYD COCKS THE HAMMER.

                         LLOYD
               THE GUN IS SILENCED, ROGER.

     MURTAUGH STARES HIM DOWN.  EYES  LIKE  FIRE.

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, BUDDY ... ?
               YOU GONNA SAVE MY LIFE, JUST SO
               YOU CAN SNUFF ME TWENTY YEARS
               LATER...?

                         LLOYD
               THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

                         MURTAUGH
               I GUESS.

     A MOMENT. LLOYD STARES INTENTLY.  FINGER  SWEATING  ON  THE
     TRIGGER.

                         MURTAUGH
               IF YOU CAN DO IT, DO IT.  I DON'T
               FUCKING CARE ANYMORE.

     LLOYD BLINKS. SWALLOWS.  ANOTHER  MOMENT.  FINALLY  --  HE
     LOWERS THE GUN.  SIGHS.

                         LLOYD
               ... WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW... ?

     MURTAUGH RELAXES VISIBLY. AND THAT'S  WHEN  TWO  THINGS
     HAPPEN. THE PICTURE WINDOW  GLASS  SUDDENLY  COLLAPSES.
     FALLS TINKLING INTO A MILLION SHARDS. AND  THE  CARTON  OF
     MILK IN LLOYD'S HAND POPS, SPURTING MILK ALL  OVER  THE
     FRONT OF HIS BLACK SUIT.  HE FROWNS.  STARES AT THE
     DRIBBLING MILK. BLINKS. AND HIS EYES  SNAP  OPEN  WIDE,  AS
     BLOOD SEEPS OUT OF HIS SHIRT, SPATTERING THE FLOOR.

                         LLOYD
               ROGER -- !

     WITH HIS DYING BREATH, HE LEAPS IN FRONT  OF  MURTAUGH.
     TAKES THE SECOND BULLET. THE ONE  MEANT  FOR  MURTAUGH.
     IT BLOWS HIM INTO ROGER, TAKES THEM BOTH TO THE  FLOOR  IN
     A BREATH-CRUSHING IMPACT. MORE BULLETS  CHOP  THE  KITCHEN.
     CHINA PLATES BURST INTO A GLASSY SPRAY.  FOOD SPATTERS
     AND GUSHES, STAINING THE WALLS.  MURTAUGH  ROLLS  FREE,
     THEN, A MAN POSSESSED:  SCREAMS OUT THE WINDOW:

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGGS!!!

84   EXT. LAWN                                                       84

     MURTAUGH'S VOICE IS FAR AWAY.  RIGGS LOOKS UP FROM HIS
     LAWN CHAIR. NOTICES  TWO  THINGS:  ONE:  EVERYTHING  SEEMS
     NORMAL. NOBODY HAS HEARD THE  SHOTS.  TWO:  THE  GLASS  IN
     THE KITCHEN WINDOW... SOMETHING STRANGE, WHAT THE HELL
     IS IT ... OH, YEAH, IT'S  BROKEN, SOMEONE BROKE THE GLASS ...
     AND RIGGS IS ON HIS FEET IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

85   BACK INSIDE                                                      85

     MURTAUGH IS AT THE WINDOW.  GUN POINTED.

                         MURTAUGH
               RIGGS!!!

86   MURTAUGH'S POV                                                  86

     REVEALS A CROWD OF PEOPLE, MILLING BACK AND FORTH, HE
     HAS NO IDEA WHERE THE SNIPER IS,  AND  SUDDENLY  BAM  --  !
     THE WOOD BLOWS OUT NOT TWO INCHES  FROM  HIS  HEAD  AND  HE
     DUCKS, AND MEANWHILE -- BACK OUTSIDE ...

87   MARTIN RIGGS                                                     87

     HE'S ON THE MOVE. HE JOGS ... TROTS ... RUNS ...  NOTICING  A
     LONE MAN IN BLACK, STRIDING QUICKLY ACROSS THE LAWN,
     STRIDING INTO THE CROWD ... TOWARD THE EDGE OF  THE  BLUFF  ...
     THINGS HAPPEN FAST NOW, PAY ATTENTION, AS -- THE MAN
     TURNS, SEES RIGGS ... RIGGS SEES HIM... AND THE MAN IS
     NONE OTHER THAN MR. JOSHUA.  CREW CUT.  SUNGLASSES.
     MOVING FAST.

88   MURTAUGH                                                         88

     DIVING OUT THE WINDOW.  HITS.  ROLLS, COMES UP.  SCREAM-
     ING, WAVING AT RIGGS ...

89   RIGGS                                                            89

     GUN OUT ... MOVING FAST,  SHOVING  THROUGH  THE  CROWD,  PEOPLE
     SCREAMING NOW, "JESUS, HE'S GOT A GUN -- !" RUNNING
     ACROSS THE LAWN,  MURTAUGH  THIRTY  YARDS  BEHIND,  MOVING,
     HARD AND FAST,  BOTH  GUNS  DRAWN,  PUSHING/SHOVING,  KNOCK-
     ING PEOPLE ASS OVER TEACUPS AND MEANWHILE LET US NOT
     FORGET --

90   JOSHUA                                                          90

     MOVING AT A DEAD RUN, NOW, GUN OUT ... AT THE EDGE OF THE
     CLIFF. PEOPLE ALL  AROUND  HIM,  CONFUSED,  I  MEAN  JESUS,
     WHAT THE HELL IS ALL  THIS  SHOOTING  ABOUT,  AND  RIGGS  CAN'T
     GET A CLEAR SHOT ... HE'S SWEEPING THE  GUN,  BACK  AND  FORTH,
     BODIES CROSSING IN FRONT OF HIM... ALL THE WRONG BODIES,
     GODDAMMIT...!  MOVING FORWARD, SHOUTING:

                         RIGGS
               LIE DOWN!!!  DOWN!!!

     MURTAUGH, SPRINGING HELL BENT  FOR  LEATHER  --  AND  FOLKS,
     GRAB YOUR HATS ... BECAUSE JUST THEN,  A  BELL  COBPA  HELI-
     COPTER CRESTS THE EDGE OF THE BLUFF.

     AN EXPLOSION OF SOUND...
     AS IT RISES LIKE AN AVENGING ANGEL ...
     HOVERS, SHATTERING THE AIR WITH TURBO-THROB, SANDBLASTING
     THE HILLSIDE WITH A ROTO-WASH OF LOOSE DIRT, TABLES,
     CHAIRS, EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT NAILED DOWN ...

     SCREAMING, CHAOS, FRENZY.
     THREE WORDS THAT APPLY TO THIS SCENE.

     AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS -- JOSHUA STEPS ONTO THE
     CHOPPER AND IS HAULED INSIDE.
     NO EXPRESSION.
     THE TOTAL PROFESSIONAL.
     AND THEN, MY FRIENDS, IT'S BYE-BYE TIME.  THE CHOPPER
     ROARS LIKE A BEHEMOTH, TILTS --
     SLIPS OVER THE SIDE AND PLUMMETS AWAY ...

     SLICK.  VERY SLICK.
     EXCEPT MARTIN RIGGS IT NOT IMPRESSED.

     HE'S STILL RUNNING, YOU SEE ...
     DIVES FLAT AT THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF, NEARLY FLINGS
     HIMSELF OVER THE DAMN EDGE ...
     GUN EXTENDED LIKE IT'S PART OF HIS ARM...
     FINGER FLAT ON THE TRIGGER ...
     BLOWING SHOT AFTER SHOT AT THE RETREATING CHOPPER ...
     BAM-BAM-BAM        HIS FACE CONTORTED IN A RICTUS OF
     ANIMAL CONCENTRATION...

     AND HE WINGS THE CHOPPER, EVEN.  POP
     SPRAY OF FIBERGLASS, BUT NOSSIR, NO CIGAR...
     CAUSE THE DAMN CHOPPER FLIES AWAY.

     AND RIGGS DUMPS HIS MAGAZINE, STUFFS IN A NEW ONE ...
     AND JESUS CHRIST HE KEEPS FIRING.

     AS MURTAUGH WALKS UP BESIDE HIM.  STARES DOWN.
     GUN HELD LOOSE AT HIS SIDE.

     RIGGS STILL FIRES, BAM-BAM-BAM
     DOESN'T KNOW IT YET ...
     UNTIL HIS MAGAZINE CLICKS EMPTY.

     HE LIES FLAT.
     STARES.
     PEOPLE SCREAMING, RUNNING AWAY.
     MURTAUGH STANDING OVER HIM, STARING DOWN AT THIS ANIMAL
     WITH A GUN, WHO EVEN NOW REFUSES TO  LOOK  AWAY  FROM  THE
     RETREATING CHOPPER, WHOSE GUN EVEN NOW CONTINUES TO
     FOLLOW ITS COURSE OUT OVER THE SEA.

     HANDS, CLUTCHING TLIE BARREL.
     FINALLY, THEY RELAX.
     RIGGS SHUTS HIS EYES.
     MURTAUGH STARES.

               YOU THROUGH?

     RIGGS LOOKS UP AT HIM.  HIS EYES LOOK LIKE A DEMON'S.

                        RIGGS
               I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.

                                            CUT TO:

91   INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME                                91

     JOSHUA AND HIS PILOT ARE CRUISING OVER THE SURF AT BREAK-
     NECK SPEED, THE ROTOR STIRRING TINY GEYSERS OF WATER.
     JOSHUA SPEAKS INTO A RADIO MICROPHONE.

                         JOSHUA
               YES, SIR ... YES, SIR, MR. LLOYD
               IS DEAD.  I'M AFRAID, HOWEVER,
               THAT ANOTHER PROBLEM EXISTS.

92   INTERCUT - THE GENERAL                                     92

     IN HIS VAN, SPEAKING ON MOBILE PHONE.

                         GENERAL
               DEFINE.

                         JOSHUA
               LLOYD SPOKE TO THE COPS, SIR.

                         GENERAL
               ARE THE COPS DEAD?

                         JOSHUA
               NO, SIR.  I MISSED.

     THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PAUSE.  JOSHUA LICKS HIS LIPS.
     THEN:

                         GENERAL
               THAT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING.  THE
               POLICE MAY KNOW EVERYTHING.  THE
               WHOLE OPERATION,  YES?

                         JOSHUA
               YES.  AWAITING ORDERS, SIR.

                         GENERAL
               JOSHUA, I THINK IT'S TIME TO TURN
               UP THE HEAT.

93   EXT. VIEWSITE - NIGHT                                            93

     A BLACK CAMARO IS PARKED AT THE  SIDE  OF  THE  ROAD.  THE
     CITY TWINKLES BEYOND.

94   INT. CAR - SAME                                                  94

     TWO TEENAGERS, ENGAGED IN A FIRST-RATE MAKEOUT SESSION.
     ONE OF THEM IS ROGER MURTAUGH'S DAUGHTER RIANNE.  THE
     OTHER IS MARK, HE OF THE HILARIOUS DIMPLES.  THEY ARE
     KISSING WHEN RIANNE SUDDENLY PULLS AWAY:

                         RIANNE
               MARK, I GOTTA GET HOME.

                         MARK
               WOULD YOU QUIT WORRYING?  YOUR
               MOM THINKS YOU'RE ASLEEP AND
               YOUR DAD'S BUSY SHOOTING CROOKS.

                         RIANNE
               HE SAID HE'LL SHOOT YOU IF WE
               HAVE SEX.

                         MARK
               SOME THINGS ARE WORTH DYING FOR.

     HE LEANS IN AND KISSES HER.  PASSION, HORNINESS.  SOME-
     THING.  HE RUNS A HAND  INSIDE  HER  SWEATER.  SHE  STARTS  TO
     RESIST.  GIVES IN.

                         RIANNE
               WAIT.

     SHE TAKES OUT HER GUM AND STICKS IT TO THE STEERING WHEEL.      *
     LEANS OVER TO KISS  HIM  AGAIN                                  *

94A  FACE                                                        94A *

                                              CUT TO:

95   EXT. THIRD STREET - NIGHT                                       95

     MARTIN RIGGS WALKS SLOWLY DOWN THE BOULEVARD.  IN ONE
     HAND HE CARRIES A SNAPSHOT OF AMANDA LLOYD.  MALE PROS-
     TITUTES TAKE ONE LOOK AT HIM AND FLEE.

     HE STOPS TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE.  AS HE DOES -- HE NOTICES
     A REFLECTION IN THE SILVER LIGHTER.

     TWO PINPOINTS OF LIGHT.  MOVING.  HE THROWS AWAY THE CIG-
     ARETTE. SPINS, DRAWING HIS  GUN.  HEADLIGHTS,  AS  A  CAR
     COMES BARRELING OUT OF THE DARKNESS.  BEARING DOWN ON
     RIGGS AT FIFTY MILES AN  HOUR.  RIGGS  FIRES.  THE  WIND-
     SHIELD SPLINTERS.  NO DICE.  THE CAR KEEPS COMING.  RIGGS
     FIRES AGAIN, SPRINTS FOR COVER -- AS  A  MERCENARY  LEANS
     OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW WITH A PUMP SHOTGUN.  TRIGGERS
     THREE BLASTS AT RIGGS. THE FIRST TWO  BLOW  OUT  CHUNKS  OF
     SCENERY. THE THIRD TAKES RIGGS  IN  THE  CHEST.  BLOWS  HIM
     BACKWARD THROUGH A STORE WINDOW.  GLASS SHATTERS.  HE HITS
     THE GROUND IN A HEAP.  THE CAR SHRIEKS OFF INTO THE NIGHT,
     LAYING RUBBER.  THE ECHO OF GUNFIRE SLOWLY FADES ON THE
     WIND...

96   INSIDE DARKENED STORE                                        96

     RIGGS LIES CRUMPLED IN A POOL  OF  BROKEN  GLASS.  MURTAUGH
     CHARGES FROM ACROSS THE STREET.  HE THROWS HIMSELF DOWN
     BESIDE THE DEAD RIGGS.  RIPS OPEN RIGGS' SHIRT REVEALING --
     A BULLETPROOF VEST.  RIGGS OPENS HIS EYES.

                         RIGGS
               I'M PISSED, ROGER.  NOW I'M PISSED.

96A  EXT.  STORE                                           96A

     THE COPS EXIT AND CROSS THE STREET TOWARD THEIR CAR.

                         RIGGS
               ROGER.  QUIT LOOKING SO DAMN
               WORRIED.  I'M   FINE.

                         MURTAUGH
               TWO INCHES HIGHER, THEY WOULD'VE
               GOT YOUR HEAD.

                         RIGGS
               FUCK THAT.  TWO INCHES TO THE LEFT,
               THEY WOULD'VE GOT MY SMOKES.

     HE TAKES OUT A PACK, LIGHTS ONE UP.

97   EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT

     MURTAUGH'S CAR SCREECHES TO THE CURB.  HOPS THE SIDEWALK,
     JOLTS TO A STOP.  THE TWO COPS ARE OUT AND RUNNING IN A
     DEAD HEAT TOWARD THE FRONT DOOR. MURTAUGH FLINGS OPEN
     THE DOOR. STOPS. ON THE CARPET BENEATH THE MAIL  SLOT
     IS A TINY ENVELOPE WITH SEASONS GREETINGS EMBLAZONED
     ACROSS THE FRONT.  A NOTE IS ATTACHED WITH A PAPER CLIP.
     ONE SIDE READS DETECTIVE ROGER MURTAUGH. ON THE OTHER
     SIDE IS A MESSAGE IN BLOCK CAPITALS.

               YOUR DAUGHTER LOOKS REALLY PRETTY NAKED

     MURTAUGH TEARS OPEN THE ENVELOPE, AFRAID TO BREATHE.
     INSIDE IS A POLAROID SNAPSHOT. THE AUDIENCE MAY GET A
     GLIMPSE OF IT, OR THEY MAY NOT.  EITHER WAY, THE EFFECT
     IT HAS ON MURTAUGH IS DEVASTATING.  HE DROPS THE SNAPSHOT
     LIKE A LIVE SNAKE.  BACKS AWAY, STUMBLES INTO THE WALL.
     SHAKES HIS HEAD.

                         MURTAUGH
               BASTARDS ... BASTARDS ...

     RIGGS LOOKS ON, STUNNED.  THE TELEPHONE RINGS.  RINGS
     AGAIN.

                         RIGGS
               ROGER.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS UP. SNAPS OUT  OF   IT.  DOWN  THE  HALL,  HIS
     WIFE TRISH MOVES TO ANSWER THE    PHONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T ANSWER THAT!!

     HE RUSHES DOWN THE HALL, SCOOPS UP THE RECEIVER:

                         MURTAUGH
               MURTAUGH.

     HE LISTENS INTENTLY, A LOOK OF PURE DREAD ON HIS FACE.
     HANGS UP SLOWLY, STARES STRAIGHT  AHEAD.  ON  THE  TABLE,  A
     STUFFED BEAR STARES BACK IMPASSIVELY.  TRISH MURTAUGH
     LOOKS ON, TERRIFIED.

                         MURTAUGH
               THEY TOOK MY KID... BASTARDS TOOK
               MY KID ...

     BESIDE HIM, RIGGS' FACE CONTORTS INTO A LOOK OF SHEER,
     BRUTAL HATRED ... GET READY FOR WORLD WAR THREE.

     MCCASKEY IS SEATED NEXT TO A  BANK  OF  TELEPHONES,  SMOKING
     AND READING A COMIC BOOK. BEHIND HIM  THE  FAT  COP  WE  SAW
     EARLIER IS CONDUCTING HIS CHOIR IN A THOROUGHLY HIDEOUS
     VERSION OF "DECK THE HALLS."  THE PHONE RINGS.

                         SINGING COPS

     JOSHUA IS ON THE OTHER END.  BESIDE HIM THE GENERAL
     LOOKS ON INTENTLY.

                         JOSHUA
               HELLO, I'M CALLING FROM THE

               YES, SERGEANT RIGGS HAS BEEN
               KILLED.  SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST
               BY UNKNOWN ASSAILANTS.

                         JOSHUA
               MY GOD.  I'M SORRY.

                         MCCASKEY
               IT'S A BAD DAY FOR ALL OF US.  AND

                         JOSHUA
               GOODBYE.

     HE HANGS UP.  TURNS TO THE GENERAL.

                         JOSHUA
               BINGO.  RIGGS IS OUT OF THE
               PICTURE.

               I WANT MURTAUGH TAKEN ALIVE.

                         JOSHUA
               HE MAY NOT TALK.

                         GENERAL
               WE HAVE HIS LITTLE GIRL.  HE'LL
               TALK.

101  INT. RIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                               101  *

     TRISH MURTAUGH LOOKS LIKE SHE COULD COME APART AT ANY       *
     MOMENT.
     SHE WALKS AROUND THE BEDROOM, SLOWLY.
     TOUCHING THINGS.
     TOUCHING HER DAUGHTER'S POSSESSIONS.

     MURTAUGH ENTERS.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER.
     HE HANDS HER THE .22.

                         MURTAUGH
               TAKE THIS.  UNTIL IT'S OVER, I
               DON'T WANT YOU TO LET IT OUT OF
               YOUR SIGHT.
     HIS WIFE NODS.  RUNS A HAND THROUGH HER HAIR.  SHIFTS
     FROM ONE FOOT TO THE OTHER.

                         MURTAUGH
               THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HURT HER.
               IF I DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY...
               THEY'LL LET HER GO.
                    (BEAT)
               SHE'S COMING HOME.

     A MOMENT.  THEN:

                         TRISH
               WHAT ABOUT YOU  ...  ?

     MURTAUGH SAYS NOTHING.

102  INT.  LIVING  ROOM  -  SAME  TIME                        102

     RIGGS HAS HIS SHIRT OFF, AND IS CAREFULLY REMOVING
     SLIVERS OF GLASS FROM HIS SHOULDER.  CIGARETTE DANGLING
     FROM HIS LIPS.

     HE HEARS A NOISE
     AND SPINS, STARTLED.

103  RIGGS' POV - SIX-YEAR-OLD CARRIE MURTAUGH             103

     ADORABLE IN A BLUE NIGHTGOWN, RICKLES THE CAT CRADLED
     LOVINGLY IN HER ARMS.

     RIGGS RELAXES.
     SMILES.
     CARRIE WALKS  OVER  TO  HIM.

                         RIGGS
               HEY, MISSY.

                         CARRIE
               I  CAN'T   SLEEP.

                         RIGGS
               UH-OH.  NOT GOOD.

     HE SCOOPS HER UP.

                         RIGGS
               WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

                         CARRIE
               RICKLES THE CAT.

                         RIGGS
               HUH.  HE IS  A  CUTIE.

     CARRIE LOOKS  AT  HIM  THEN.
     AND SHE DOES A PECULIAR THING.
     SLOWLY, SHE REACHES OUT ...
     RIGGS LOOKING ON...
     AND TOUCHES HIS BACK.  RUNS HER TINY HAND OVER THE KNIFE
     SCAR BENEATH HIS SHOULDER.
     FASCINATED BY IT.

                         CARRIE
               OUCH.

     RIGGS LOOKS AT HER.  SMILES, AND WHISPERS SOFTLY:

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.
                    (BEAT)
               OUCH...

     AND HE SUDDENLY HUGS THE LITTLE GIRL FOR ALL HE'S  WORTH.
     CLOSES HIS EYES TIGHT.

     IN THAT MOMENT, EVERY SINGLE YEAR CATCHES UP TO RIGGS,
     AND HE LOOKS, FOR A MOMENT, INCREDIBLY OLD, AND SO VERY,
     VERY TIRED ...

104  INT. LIVING ROOM  -  LATER                             104

     CARRIE IS ASLEEP ON THE COUCH, SNUGGLED BENEATH A KNITTED
     AFGHAN.  RIGGS AND MURTAUGH STAND ACROSS THE ROOM, CON-
     FERRING IN HUSHED TONES.

                         RIGGS
               YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO KILL
               HER.

                         MURTAUGH
               YES.

                         RIGGS
               YOU WANT HER BACK, YOU'VE GOT TO
               TAKE HER  AWAY  FROM  THEM.

                         MURTAUGH
               I KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               GOOD.  WE DO THIS MY WAY.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU SHOOT, YOU SHOOT TO KILL.  GET
               AS MANY AS YOU CAN.  DON'T MISS.

                         MURTAUGH
               I WON'T MISS.

     A PAUSE.  RIGGS STUDIES MURTAUGH.  THEN:

                         RIGGS
               WE'RE GONNA GET BLOODY ON THIS ONE.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST ME.

     MURTAUGH STARES AT HIM FOR A MOMENT.  THEN, HE FINALLY
     SPEAKS ...

                         MURTAUGH
               ... HOW... GOOD ARE YOU... ?

                         RIGGS
               WHAT?

                         MURTAUGH
               ARE YOU... ONLY CRAZY ... OR ARE
               YOU... AS GOOD AS YOU SAY YOU
               ARE... ?

     THERE  IS  A  PAUSE.   THEN:

                         RIGGS
               NO ONE CAN TOUCH ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               GOOD.  KILL EVERY FUCKING ONE OF
               THEM.  OKAY ... ?

     AT WHICH POINT, MY FRIENDS, A LIGHT FLICKERS ON BEHIND
     RIGGS' EYES.

     WE SEE  GRIM  DETERMINATION,  SURE  ...
     BUT WE ALSO SENSE SOMETHING ELSE, ODDLY ENOUGH:
     ANTICIPATION.
     RIGGS IS A MACHINE ... AND THE MACHINE IS, WELL ...
     REVVING  UP.  HE  LOOKS  AT   MURTAUGH:

                         RIGGS
               GET HALF.  I'LL KILL THE OTHER
               HALF.

     A MOMENT PASSES BETWEEN THEM. THIS  WILL  BE  THE  MOST
     DEVASTATING NIGHT OF THEIR LIVES.  THEY WILL PROBABLY
     DIE.

     A RINGING PHONE SHATTERS THE STILLNESS.

                         RIGGS
               HERE WE GO.

105  OMITTED                                                       105

106  INT. MARTIN RIGGS' TRAILER - DAY                              106

     THE APARTMENT IS DARK, ILLUMINATED ONLY  BY  A  TINY  LAMP.
     RIGGS CROSSES TO THE WINDOW, PEERS OUT THROUGH SLATTED
     BLINDS.  ON TELEVISION A GROUP OF CAROLERS SINGS "TIDINGS
     OF COMFORT AND JOY." RIGGS  LOOKS  AT  THE  WALL  CALENDAR:
     DECEMBER 22.  THE CLOCK TICKS.  THE REFRIGERATOR HUMS.

     HE GOES TO THE CLOSET.  OPENS IT.  A CLOUD OF DUST
     BILLOWS OUT. REACHES  IN,  REMOVES  A  WEATHERED  CARDBOARD
     BOX.  SITS IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM, TAKES A SHOT OF
     BOURBON.

     OPENS THE BOX. INSIDE IS  A  SET  OF  DESERT  FATIGUES.  HE
     TAKES THEM OUT.  UNDERNEATH  A  WICKED-LOOKING  HUNTING
     KNIFE. HE TAKES THAT, TOO.  HOLDS  IT  UP  NEAR  HIS  FACE,
     AND IT POSITIVELY SPARKLES IN THE DIM LIGHT ...

                                                 TIME  CUT:

107  ANOTHER ANGLE                                          107

     BREATHES:  IN, OUT ... IN, OUT...

     GLANCES AT THE PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS WIFE ON THE WALL.
     WEDDING GOWN.  WHITE LACE-AND-SATIN RUFFLES.  BEAUTIFUL.

     HIS FACE IS  CRAGGY.  WEATHERED.  COVERED  WITH  DESERT
     PAINT.  SURELY HE WAS NEVER MARRIED ... NOT THIS DEMON...

                         RIGGS
               FORGIVE ME.

     THERE IS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  RIGGS SPINS.  LIGHTNING

                         RIGGS
               COME IN SLOW.

     THE DOOR OPENS  AND ROGER MURTAUGH ENTERS, CARRYING A
     BRIEFCASE.  HE  LOOKS BRIEFLY AT RIGGS' COMBAT GET-UP.
     SHRUGS.  SETS THE BRIEFCASE ON THE BED, OPENS IT.  IT
     IS FILLED WITH ROUND UPON ROUND OF AMMUNITION.

                         MURTAUGH

               THOUSAND YARDS OKAY ... ?

109  EXT. LOW DESERT - DAY                                  109

     THE DESERT FLOOR SHIMMERS WITH STORED HEAT, BATHED IN
     RELENTLESS SUNLIGHT.

     A LONE CAR, PLOWING ALONG TOWARD THE HORIZON.  LOOKING
     LOST AND UTTERLY ALONE BENEATH THE CLEAR DECEMBER SKY.

110  INT. CAR - ROGER MURTAUGH                                    110

     DRIVING. RELENTLESSLY ONWARD, HIS FACE  LOCKED  IN  A  MASK
     OF CONTAINED FURY.  DUST BILLOWS PAST THE WINDOWS.  WIND.
     HE KEEPS DRIVING, STRAINING HIS EYES AHEAD, FOCUSING
     THROUGH THE HUNDRED-DEGREE SHIMMER... NOTICING, FINALLY
     A SERIES OF SHAPES ... DIM MIRAGES... SILHOUETTES MAYBE,
     POSSIBLY MEN... POSSIBLY THE MEN...        THE  MIRAGE  RESOLVES.

     MERCS.  STANDING NEXT TO A BLACK SEDAN.  MURTAUGH
     STIFFENS. LEANS FORWARD,  PUNCHES  THE  CIGARETTE  LIGHTER,
     AND AS HE DOES -- HE WHISPERS INTO HIS HIDDEN
     MICROPHONE.

                         MURTAUGH
               SPLIT.

111  EXT. CAR - DAY

     IT HAPPENS IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE:  THE  TRUNK  POPS  OPEN,
     AND OUT ROLLS MARTIN RIGGS.  YANKS A ROPE.  THE TRUNK
     SLAMS SHUT.  RIGGS HITS.  ROLLS.  COMES UP, COMBAT-
     CROUCHED, HUNKERS OFF AT A DEAD HEAT.  HE IS CLAD 3'.N
     HIS DESERT FATIGUES.  MAGNUM SNIPER RIFLE SLUNG OVER
     ONE SHOULDER.

112  EXT. MURTAUGH - DESERT                                       112

     MURTAUGH ROLLS TO A HALT AND STEPS FROM HIS CAR.

     FACING THREE ARMED MERCS.  MURTAUGH  SIMPLY  STANDS  THERE,
     READING THE ODDS.  SCANNING ...

                         MERC #1
               MURTAUGH?

                         MURTAUGH
               YES.
                    (BEAT)
               I'M ALONE.

                         MERC  #1
               HANDS UP.  COME WITH US.

                         MURTAUGH
               SHOW ME THE GIRL.

                         MERC  #1
               SHE'S  NOT   HERE.

                         MURTAUGH
               BULLSHIT.  LET ME SEE HER.  THEN
               I  COME   QUIETLY.

     THE MERC NODS.

113  VAN                                                              113

     COMES AT US FROM ACROSS THE DESERT.

114  INT. VAN                                                         114

     INSIDE, RIANNE IS GAGGED, HELPLESS.  SHE LOOKS TERRIFIED.
     NEXT TO HER, MR. JOSHUA HBLDS A COCKED PISTOL.  MERC #1
     LEANS IN:

                         MERC #1
               HE WANTS TO SEE THE GIRL.

115  BACK OUTSIDE                                                     115

     MURTAUGH  WAITS.  SWEATING.   HANDS   IN   POCKETS.   AND   OUT
     COMES RIANNE, FOLLOWED BY THE VICIOUS MERC.  HE HOLDS A
     KNIFE SQUARELY AT HER THROAT.  MURTAUGH'S EYES FILL WITH
     TEARS.  RELIEF THAT SHE'S ALIVE..

                         MERC  #1
               SIMPLE EXCHANGE.  YOU COME WITH
               US, THE GIRL TAKES A WALK.

                         MURTAUGH
               LET  HER  GO  NOW.

                         MERC  #1
               NO.  TAKE YOUR HANDS OUT OF YOUR
               POCKETS.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (SHRUGS)
               SURE THING, PAL...

     HE SLOWLY RAISES HIS HANDS.  IN HIS LEFT HAND, HE
     CLUTCHES  A  SHINY  METAL   SPHERE.   A   GRENADE.   MURTAUGH'S
     GRIP IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING IT DEAD.  THE MERC SWEARS
     VIOLENTLY.

                         MURTAUGH
               THIS FUCKER'S ALIVE.
                    (BEAT)
               LET HER GO OR WE ALL DIE.

     AND THAT'S WHEN MR. JOSHUA STEPS OUT OF THE CAR.  DEADLY
     CALM.  ALL HEADS TURN.  CREWCUT-  MIRRORED SUNGLASSES.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               TAKE HIM.

                         MERC #1
               BUT SIR ...

                         MR. JOSHUA
               HE'S BLUFFING, IT'S A DUD.  HE
               WOULDN'T RISK KILLING HIS
               DAUGHTER.

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T PUSH  ME.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               TAKE HIM.

116  EXT. HILLTOP  - MEANWHILE                                  116

     FAR AWAY.  THE CAR AND THE SURROUNDING FIGURES ARE TINY.
     A LONE SOLDIER CROUCHES.  RIGGS.  THE RIFLE IS ON HIS
     SHOULDER.  HIS EYE IS GLUED TO THE SCOPE.

117  INFRA-RED IMAGE SHOWS RIANNE AND HER CAPTOR                117

     RIGGS' CONCENTRATION IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.  LIKE A
     STATUE.  HE LICKS A FINGER.  RAISES IT, TESTING THE WIND.

                         RIGGS
               COME ON... COME ON...

118  BACK WITH MURTAUGH                                         118

     AS HE AND JOSHUA STARE EACH OTHER DOWN.  TENSE.  TENSE.
     HIS HAND CLUTCHES THE GRENADE.  MERC #1 PUSHES THE KNIFE
     INTO RIANNE'S THROAT.

                         MERC #1
               PUT THE PIN BACK IN.  DO IT.

     MURTAUGH SWEATS.  MR. JOSHUA BEGINS TO WALK FORWARD,
     GUN EXTENDED.  COOL AS ICE.  ANOTHER STEP.  SMILING ...

119  ON  HILLTOP                                                119

     RIGGS SITS DEAD STILL, FOCUSING THROUGH THE SNIPER
     SCOPE.

                         RIGGS
               COME ON... MOVE AWAY FROM THE GIRL ...

120  MURTAUGH                                            120

     JOSHUA STOPS IN FRONT OF MURTAUGH.  COCKS THE GUN.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               DROP THE FUCKING GRENADE.

                         MURTAUGH
               I DO AND WE DIE.

                         MR. JOSHUA
               NO.  I DON'T THINK SO.

     HE SIGHTS DOWN THE GUN AND PULLS THE TRIGGER:  ALL HELL
     BREAKS LOOSE. HERE'S  WHAT  HAPPENS:  BAM  --  !  THE  BULLET
     CATCHES MURTAUGH IN THE SHOULDER.  HE DROPS THE GRENADE.
     IT ROLLS, AND MERCS DIVE FOR COVER.  THE MERC HOLDING
     RIANNE TAKES A STEP BACK.  BINGO.

121  ON HILL                                                        121

     RIGGS GRUNTS.  FIRES.

122  BELOW                                                          122

     THE MERC DROPS.  JOSHUA'S HEAD SNAPS AROUND.  HE STARES
     OFF AT THE DISTANCE AND HISSES:

                         JOSHUA
               RIGGS ... !

     MEANWHILE, MURTAUGH ROLLS, COMES  UP,  GUN  IN  HAND.  FIRES,
     BAM

                         MURTAUGH
               RIANNE, THE CAR!

     RIANNE BOLTS.  MEANWHILE --

123  ON  HILLTOP                                                    123

     RIGGS SWIVELS THE BARREL, HALF AN INCH.  GRUNTS.  FIRES.

124  DOWN  BELOW                                                    124

     THE BLACK SEDAN'S WINDSHIELD SPLINTERS.  THE CAR ROCKS
     WITH THE IMPACT AS THE DRIVER IS KILLED INSTANTLY.

125  GRENADE                                                        125

     CHOOSES THAT MOMENT TO EXPLODE, POOF ... INTO A CLOUD OF
     ORANGE SMOKE.  A SHOWER OF CONFETTI.

                         JOSHUA
               DUD!  IT'S A DUD!

126  RIANNE                                                         126

     IS RUNNING FOR THE CAR AS JOSHUA SWIVELS  IN  HER  DIRECTION,
     LINING UP THE UZI, FIRING A BURST --  UNTIL  A  BULLET  FROM
     RIGGS PARTS HIS HAIR, SENDS HIM DIVING TO  THE  SAND,  THE
     UZI SPROUTING FLAME -- AS RIANNE FLINGS OPEN  THE  CAR  DOOR,
     SCREAMS -- AT THE BLOOD-SPATTERED  CORPSE  WHICH  ROLLS  OFF
     THE STEERING WHEEL. BULLETS  BLAST  THE  CAR.  METAL  POPS
     AND BURSTS.  SHE JUMPS IN.

127  MURTAUGH                                                       127

     IS FLAT ON THE SAND, FIRING LIKE CRAZY, SHOT  AFTER  SHOT  --
     AS RIANNE FLOORS THE GAS, THE CAR PEELING OUT  IN  A'  STORM
     OF FLYING SAND AND DIRT.  DOOR OPEN.  ONE LEG HANGING
     OUT.  PLOWS INTO AN ATMED MERC.  HE FLIES UP ONTO THE
     HOOD, SPINS, STILL CONSCIOUS, AND TAKES  AIM  THROUGH  THE
     WINDSHIELD, RIGHT AT HER ...

128  ON HILL                                                        128

     RIGGS SWIVELS, LIGHTNING QUICK.

                         RIGGS
               NO.

     GRUNTS.  FIRES.

129  MERC ON HOOD                                                   129

     IS BLOWN OFF THE CAR.

130  RIANNE                                                         130

     SCREAMS, THE DEAD DRIVER SPRAWLED  AGAINST  ONE  SHOULDER,
     HER FOOT NAILED TO THE GAS PEDAL ... AS THE CAR LEAPS
     LIKE A KICKED DOG AND CAREENS OFF INTO THE DESERT.

131  ON  HILLTOP                                                    131

     RIGGS LINES UP FOR ANOTHER SHOT -- AND THERE IS A SOFT
     CLICK -- !  HE  WHIRLS.  THE  GENERAL  HAS  ARRIVED.  STAND-
     ING AT THE TOP OF THE HILL.  HIS M-16 IS COCKED AND
     LOCKED.

                         GENERAL
               YOU'RE NOT THAT FAST, SON.
                    (BEAT)
               DROP THE RIFLE.

     HE SPEAKS INTO A WALKIE-TALKIE.

                         GENERAL
               I GOT RIGGS.

132  ON DESERT FLOOR                                           132

     MURTAUGH MAKES A BREAK FOR IT, FIRING BLIND -- UNTIL THE
     GROUND BEFORE HIM LITERALLY EXPLODES WITH GUNFIRE.  THE
     EARTH IS CHOPPED TO TATTERS.  DIRT FLIES.  HE STOPS.
     PUFFING FOR BREATH.  RAISES HIS HANDS.  AS THE SMOKE
     CLEARS, MR. JOSHUA APPROACHES LIKE A DEINON THROUGH FOG.
     HE IS FLANKED BY TWO MERCS WITH UZIS-

                         JOSHUA
               A VERY NICE TRY.
                    (SPEAKS INTO
                     WALKIE-TALKIE)
               KENDO.  GET THE GIRL.

133  ON  HILLTOP                                               133

     RIGGS STANDS, HANDS OVER HEAD.  THE GENERAL STUDIES HIM
     THOUGHTFULLY.

                         GENERAL
               MARTIN RIGGS.  YOUR COMBAT RECORD
               IS THE STUFF OF LEGEND.

                         RIGGS
               SO IS YOURS.  GENERAL PETER
               MCALLISTER, COMMANDER OF SHADOW
               COMPANY.

                         GENERAL
               I SEE WE'VE HEARD OF EACH OTHER.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.  IT'LL ALMOST BE A SHAME
               WHEN I KILL YOU.

                         GENERAL
                    (LAUGHS)
               I DON'T THINK SO, SON.

134  DESERT FLOOR                                              134

     MR. JOSHUA SAYS TO MURTAUGH:

                         MR. JOSHUA
               YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A FUN EVENING.

                         MURTAUGH
               GO SPIT.

     JOSHUA SLAMS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH A KARATE BLOW.  HE
     FALLS.

135  EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY                                      135

     RIANNE IS DRIVING TO SAVE  HER  LIFE.  SCREAMING  AT  THE
     TOP OF HER LUNGS, THE NEEDLE TOUCHING  90  AS  SHE  STRUG-
     GLES TO SHOVE THE MERC'S DEAD BODY INTO THE CORNER.
     SWERVING.  SCREAMING.  AT WHICH POINT

     THE SAND EXPLODES IN FRONT OF HER.

     SHE SHRIEKS. A HOWL OF  NOISE,  A  VERITABLE  ERUPTION  OF
     SAND AND DIRT, AND IT'S ONE OF  TWO  THINGS,  IT'S  EITHER
     ALIENS FROM SPACE, DESCENDING -- OR  IT'S  A  BELL  COBRA
     HELICOPTER.

     RIANNE SWERVES TO A HALT TO  AVOID  THE  DRONING  CHOPPER,
     WHICH HOVERS LIKE A BEHEMOTH, ROTORS THROBBING, AS
     RIANNE STUMBLES FROM THE CAR AND COLLAPSES IN A HEAP
     ON THE SAND.

     LOST, ALONE, HER TEARS INAUDIBLE  OVER  THE  HIGH,  CHURN-
     ING WHINE AS WE

                                           FADE OUT.

                                          FADE IN:

136  INT. BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT                                  136

     RIGGS IS NAKED.  HE IS MANACLED HAND AND FOOT.  CHAINED
     IN A BATHTUB FULL OF WATER.  AROUND HIM IS A DINGY CON-
     CRETE BASEMENT.  JOSHUA  STEPS  FORWARD.  BEHIND  HIM  IS
     KENDO, AN ORIENTAL MERCENARY.  HE IS WORKING ON A MECHAN-
     ICAL DEVICE OF SOME KIND.  CONNECTING WIRES.  RIGGS
     GRUNTS.

                         JOSHUA
               WELL, WELL.  LOOK WHO'S BACK FROM
               THE DEAD.

     RIGGS STRUGGLES AGAINST  THE  MANACLES,  SLOPPING  WATER.

                         JOSHUA
               PLEASE SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.  I
               BELIEVE YOU'LL NEED IT.

     RIGGS STOPS MOVING.  SCOWLS AT JOSHUA AND SAYS NOTHING.
     JOSHUA SMILES.

                         JOSHUA
               YOU'RE JUST IN TIME FOR A LOT OF
               PAIN.

                         RIGGS
               I'M THRILLED.

                         JOSHUA
               OH, YOU WILL BE.  I DARESAY
               YOU'LL BE ... SHOCKED.

     KENDO SNICKERS IN THE CORNER.

                         RIGGS
               WHO'S THE CHIN?

                         JOSHUA
               SHHH.  DON'T MAKE HIM MAD.

                         RIGGS
               MY MISTAKE. WHO'S  THE  PLEASANT
               ORIENTAL PSYCHOPATH?

                         JOSHUA
               HIS NAME IS KENDO, AND HE HAS
               FORGOTTEN MORE ABOUT  DISPENSING
               PAIN THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               TERRIFIC. LISTEN, GUYS,  CAN  WE
               GET SOME MISTER BUBBLE IN HERE ...

                        JOSHUA
               PLEASE SHUT UP.
                    (STUDIES RIGGS)
               MY, MY, LOOK AT ALL THOSE SCARS.
                    (BEAT)
               SEE, MARTIN, WE HAVE A  PROBLEM.
               SINCE WE HAVE MURTAUGH, WE REALLY
               DON'T EVEN NEED YOU.  BUT I
               BELIEVE IN BEING THOROUGH.

     ACROSS THE ROOM, KENDO THROWS A SWITCH.  A MECHANICAL
     HUMMING FILLS THE ROOM.

                         JOSHUA
               OUR PROBLEM -- AND YOURS, TOO
               IS THAT WE HAVE SOME
               MERCHANDISE TO DELIVER.  A RATHER
               LARGE SHIPMENT, WE'RE ALL VERY
               EXCITED.  IT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE,
               HOWEVER, IF WE SHOWED UP WITH THE
               GOODS AND FOUND OURSELVES
               SURROUNDED BY FIFTY COPS.

                         RIGGS
               THAT WOULD BE A SHAME.

                         JOSHUA
               INDEED.  SO YOU SEE, MARTIN, IT
               IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE FIND OUT
               HOW MUCH THE POLICE KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               WE DON'T KNOW SHIT.  YOU KILLED
               LLOYD BEFORE HE COULD TALK.

                         JOSHUA
               I WISH I COULD BELIEVE YOU.
               UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T.  SO, IF
               YOU'LL BE KIND ENOUGH TO TELL
               US ALL YOU KNOW, I WILL  KILL
               YOU QUICKLY.

                         RIGGS
               SUCH A DEAL, I SHOULD  WORRY.

                         JOSHUA
               OH, INDEED YOU  SHOULD.  SEE,
               MARTIN, YOU ------- TALK TO US ...

     HE GESTURES TO KENDO, WHO APPROACHES.  HE IS CARRYING A
     VERY OMINOUS DEVICE:  A SPONGE, ATTACHED TO A PORTABLE
     DRY-CELL BATTERY CASING ... JOSHUA FROWNS AT RIGGS.

                         JOSHUA
               DO YOU VOMIT?

                         RIGGS
               SOMETIMES.

     JOSHUA NODS.  SIGHS.

                         JOSHUA
               BACK BEFORE PRISON REFORM, THE
               STAFF AT SING SING INVENTED A
               RATHER UNUSUAL FORM OF PUNISHMENT.
               IT'S KNOW AS THE  HUMMINGBIRD
               TREATMENT.  ARE YOU FAMILIAR?

                         RIGGS
               PLEASE, NO TICKLING.  I  HATE
               TICKLING.

                         JOSHUA
               THE 'PATIENT' IS CHAINED NAKED
               IN A BATHTUB FULL OF WATER.  A
               BATH IS THEN ADMINISTERED USING
               A BATTERY POWERED SPONGE.  THE
               PAIN IS SAID TO BE SO EXCRUCIATING
               THAT AFTER TWENTY MINUTES MOST
               MEN ARE EITHER INSANE OR DEAD.

     RIGGS IS SILENT.

                         JOSHUA
               I THOUGHT YOU'D  LIKE IT.  I CAN
               OF COURSE, KILL YOU NOW.  SIMPLY
               TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

                         RIGGS
               GUESS WE'RE IN FOR A LONG NIGHT.
               'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW SCRATCH.

                         JOSHUA
               WE'LL FIND OUT.  KENDO ... ?

     THE ORIENTAL MOVES FORWARD.  HE BRANDISHES THE SPONGE/
     BATTERY HOOKUP.  DIPS IT INTO A BUCKET OF WATER.  RIGGS
     IS SWEATING.

                         JOSHUA
               FEEL FREE TO  SCREAM.

                         RIGGS
               HAVEN'T YOU GUYS...   HEARD OF
               YULETIDE  CHEER... ?

     KENDO HITS RIGGS WITH THE SPONGE.  RIGGS SCREAMS.  A
     HIGH, LUNATIC SCREAM.

     THRASHES IN THE WATER, SPLASHING KENDO, WHIPPING FROM
     SIDE TO SIDE AS THE ROOM SPIRALS BACK AND FORTH OUT OF
     FOCUS.  KIDS, DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.  KENDO REMOVES THE
     DEVICE.  RIGGS FALLS BACKWARD.  THUMPS AGAINST THE TUB.
     SUCKING AIR.  MOANING.

                         JOSHUA
               MY GOODNESS.  NOW THAT WAS FUN,
               WASN'T IT?

     RIGGS LOOKS AT HIM.  DRIPPING HATE.

                         RIGGS
               I'M GOING TO KILL BOTH OF YOU.

                         JOSHUA
                    (LAUGHS)
               THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
                    (BEAT)
               ABOUT THE SHIPMENT ... ?

                         RIGGS
               FUCK  YOURSELF.

     KENDO DUNKS THE BATTERY..  RUN IT DOWN RIGGS' STOMACH.
     HE SCREAMS AGAIN, AS WE MERCIFULLY ...

                                                       CUT TO:

137  OMITTED                                                     137

138  INT. DINGY BACK ROOM - SAME                                 138

     NO WINDOWS.  HARDWOOD FLOORS.  A SINGLE CHAIR IN THE
     CENTER OF THE ROOM.  ROGER MURTAUGH IS STRAPPED TIGHTLY
     TO THE CHAIR.  HIS FACE LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING HIS WIFE
     MAKES FOR DINNER.  BLACK EYES.  SWOLLEN JAW.  HIS SHIRT
     IS OFF, EXPOSING THE GUNSHOT WOUND IN HIS ARM.  THE
     GENERAL STANDS FACING HIM, FLANKED BY THREE MERCS.  THEY
     ALL WEAR HOLSTERED SIDEARMS.

                         GENERAL
               THE SHIPMENT, MR. MURTAUGH?

                         MURTAUGH
               GO SPIT.

                         GENERAL
                    (SIGHS)
               I HOPE YOU ENJOY SAYING THAT AS
               MUCH AS MR. LARCH ENJOYS PUNISHING
               YOU FOR IT.

     MR. LARCH, A BIG REDNECK WITH NO DISCERNIBLE COMPASSION,
     STEPS FORWARD.  POURS A BIG HANDFUL OF BAKING SALT FROM A
     CONTAINER.  PACKS IT INTO ROGER MURTAUGH'S GUNSHOT WOUND.
     MURTAUGH GROANS.  SHOUTS.  STRUGGLES.

     THE GENERAL LOOLCS ON WITHOUT BLINKING.

                         MURTAUGH
               THAT'S IT ... IF YOU GUYS THINK
               I'M SENDING YOU A CHRISTMAS CARD
               YOU'RE NUTS.

     LARCH CUFFS HIM, HARD.

                         GENERAL
                    (SHAKES HIS
                     HEAD)
               THIS IS GOING NOWHERE.  MR.
               LARCH ... ?

     LARCH GRINS, LEAVES THE ROOM.  A PAUSE.  MURTAUGH SWEATS,
     GLARING OUT FROM SWOLLEN EYELIDS.  THE GENERAL NODS,
     SMILES.

139  INT. BASEMENT  -  BACK  WITH  RIGGS                             139

     AS  HE  GROANS  AND  COLLAPSE  BACK INTO THE TUB.  SPLASH.
     MOANS  FEEBLY.  BLOOD  DRIPS   FROM HIS NOSE.  SALIVA DROOLS
     FROM HIS LIMP MOUTH.  HE LOOKS HALF-DEAD, PROBABLY BE-
     CAUSE HE IS JUST THAT.  KENDO PULLS AWAY THE BATTERY
     SPONGE,  SAYS  TO  JOSHUA:

                         KENDO
               HE KNOWS SHIT.  WE'RE SAFE.

                         JOSHUA
               YOU'RE SURE?

                         KENDO
               BELIEVE ME, HE'D HAVE TOLD US.

                         JOSHUA
               FINE.
                    (CLUCKS IN
                     DISGUST)
               BIG, BAD SOLDIER ... MY ASS.
                    (BEAT)
               I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.  DEAL WITH
               HIM.

                         KENDO
               DEAL  WITH   HIM?

                         JOSHUA
               YEAH.
                    (STOPS AT
                     THE DOOR)
               FRY  HIS  NUTS.

     HE EXITS.

                                            CUT TO:

140  INT. DINGY BACK ROOM - SAME TIME                            140

     THE GENERAL LEANS OVER MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH SWEATS.

                         GENERAL
               ANYTIME, ROGER.  ANYTIME.
                    (BEAT)
               SEE, THE THING OF IT IS ... WE KNOW
               WHERE YOU LIVE.
                    (FROWNS)
               IN FACT, MR. JOSHUA HAS BEEN KNOWN
               TO EXTERMINATE ENTIRE FAMILIES,
               WHEN HE GETS IN... ONE OF HIS
               MOODS.  OH, SPEAKING OF THAT --

     LARCH RE-ENTERS THE DINGY BACK ROOM.  THIS TIME HE'S  GOT
     MURTAUGH'S DAUGHTER RIANNE.  SHE IS CLAD ONLY IN A
     T-SHIRT AND BIKINI BRIEFS.

                         RIANNE
               DADDY ... PLEASE DON'T LET THEM
               HURT ME ... !

     MURTAUGH GOES NUTS.  STRUGGLES, WRENCHES, BANGS THE CHAIR UP
     AND DOWN AGAINST THE FLOOR.  NO USE.  HE IS COMPLETELY HELP-
     LESS.  SNARLS WITH RAGE:

                         MURTAUGH
               BASTARDS ... UNTIE ME AND I'LL
               KILL EVERY ONE OF YOU.

                         GENERAL
               PRECISELY WHY WE WOULD NEVER
               THINK OF UNTYING YOU.

     LARCH SHOVES RIANNE INTO THE CORNER.  SHE LANDS IN A HEAP.
     MURTAUGH IS SWEATING BUCKETS.  EYES DESPERATE.  THE
     GENERAL LEANS IN CLOSE:

                         GENEPAL
               IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING, SON, YOU
               BETTER PLAY BALL, 'CAUSE THE STAKES
               JUST WENT UP ...

141  INT. BASEMENT - SAME TIME                              141

     KENDO SWITCHES ON THE BATTERY AGAIN.  IN THE TUB, RIGGS'
     HEAD LOLLS BACK AND FORTH.  LISTLESS.  DEAD.  HIS EYES
     REFUSE TO FOCUS.  KENDO SHOWS HIM THE SPONGE.

                         RIGGS
                    (SLURRED)
               NO ... PLEASE ...

                         KENDO
               YOU DIE NOW, SERGEANT RIGGS.
               VERY SLOW.

     RIGGS  DOES  NOT  RESPOND.  STARES  INTO  SPACE.    KENDO   LEANS
     OVER THE TUB,  REACHES  IN  --  AND  THAT'S  WHEN  WE FIND OUT
     RIGGS  HAS  BEEN  FAKING.  HIS  EYES  FOCUS.   NO  LONGER HAZED.
     HE SNAPS HIS HAND  FORWARD  TO  THE  END  OF  THE  CHAIN.  GRABS
     KENDO BY THE  HAIR.  IN  THE  BLINK  OF  AN  EYE,  HE  SLAMS  THE
     MAN'S HEAD DOWN AGAINST THE PORCELAIN TUB.  KENDO'S   NOSE
     SHATTERS.  THE ORIENTAL TOPPLES OVER INTO THE TUB.  THE
     BATTERY DROPS  TO  THE  FLOOR.  RIGGS  IS  A  FUCKING  MACHINE:
     HE FLIPS THE CHAIN AROUND KENDO'S NECK AND WRENCHES.
     HARD.  HE GOES LIMP.  RIGGS IS NOT THROUGH YET.  HE
     BEGINS TO  HEAVE  AND  THRASH,  THRUSTING  AGAINST  THE  CHAINS
     -- MANEUVERING THE CORPSE ON TOP OF HIM.  SHIFTING IT.
     MOVING KENDO'S PANTS POCKET WITHIN REACH.  HE REACHES IN.
     SLOWLY, CAREFULLY, BRINGS OUT A SHINY SILVER KEY ...

142  INT. DINGY BACK ROOM --  SAME TIME                    142

     A LENGTH OF ROPE IS PULLED TAUT.  RIANNE'S BOUND HANDS
     ARE STRETCHED OVER HER HEAD.  LARCH HOOKS THE ROPE AROUND
     A PEG SET INTO THE WALL.  SHE IS HELPLESS.  MURTAUGH IS
     OUT  OF  HIS  MIND.  STRUGGLING  TO  BREAK  FREE.

                         GENERAL
               GOOD LORD.  VERY WHOLESOME-
               LOOKING GIRL.  YESSIRREEE.

                         MURTAUGH
               GODDAMMIT, I'VE TOLD YOU
               EVERYTHING!!!!

                         GENERAL
               WE'LL SOON KNOW, WON'T WE?

     LARCH APPROACHES RIANNE.  SHE SQUIRMS.

                         MURTAUGH
                    (BEAT)
               YOU TOUCH HER, YOU'RE DEAD.

                         GENERAL
               OH, SON, SPARE ME.
                    (BEAT)
               IT'S OVER, SERGEANT.  NO HEROES
               AROUND TO SAVE YOU ...

     HE PICKS UP A BASEBALL BAT.  TOSSES IT TO LARCH.

                         GENERAL
               MR. LARCH... SHE'S YOURS.

     RIANNE  SCREAMS.  MURTAUGH  SHOUTS.  STRAINS.  THE   CHAIR
     THUMPS UP AND DOWN, CREATING  AN  INSANE,  STACCATO  RHYTHM.
     THE  GENERAL  LAUGHS.  RIANNE  SHRIEKS.  HARROWING.   TERRI-
     BLE. A SCENE OUT OF HELL.  AND  THEN  THE  DEVIL  COMES  IN
     AND KICKS THE  DOOR  OFF  ITS  HINGES.  OKAY.  OKAY.  LET'S
     STOP FOR A MOMENT. FIRST  OFF,  TO  DESCRIBE  FULLY  THE
     MAYHEM WHICH RIGGS NOW CREATES WOULD  NOT  DO  IT  JUSTICE.
     HERE, HOWEVER, ARE A FEW POINTERS:  HE IS NOT FLASHY.
     HE IS NOT CHUCK NORRIS.  RATHER, HE IS LIKE A SLEDGE-
     HAMMER HITTING AN EGG. HE  DOES  NOT  KNOCK  PEOPLE  DOWN.
     HE DOES NOT  INJURE  THEM.

     HE SIMPLY  KILLS  THEM.  THE  WHOLE ROOM.  EVERYONE   STAND-
     ING. EXCEPT  FOR  --  THE  GENERAL, WHO DUCKS OUT A SIDE
     DOOR AND ESCAPES ...  RIGGS'  CHAIN MOVES LIKE A LIVE THING.
     SNAPPING HERE.  STRIKING THERE.    MERCS TRY TO  DRAW  THEIR
     GUNS -- AND SUDDENLY THEIR HANDS ARE SHATTERED WRECKS.
     ONE MERC DRAWS A  BEAD  ON  RIANNE, ALMOST GETS OFF  A  SHOT,
     BECAUSE RIGGS IS ACROSS THE ROOM.  WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT
     -- RIGGS THROWS THE CHAIN. IT  WRAPS  THE  GUY'S  NECK  AND
     KILLS HIM INSTANTLY. OUCH ... HE  GOES  DOWN,  FIRING  USE-
     LESS ROUNDS  INTO  THE  CEILING.  PLASTER  RAINS.  RIGGS
     SPINS, DIVES. SCOOPS  UP  THE  BASEBALL  BAT.  COMES  UP
     BESIDE AN ARMED MERC -- SWINGS THE BAT WITH HURRICANE
     FORCE. A SICKENING  IMPACT.  THE  BAT  BREAKS  IN  HALF.
     RIGGS SPINS, COMBAT-READY.  SCANS  THE  ROOM.  NO  ONE  LEFT
     TO KILL. USING ONLY THE  ELEMENT  OF  SURPRISE,  HE  HAS
     TAKEN OUT AN ENTIRE  ROOM  IN  HAND-TO-HAND  COMBAT.  HE
     STEPS IN FRONT OF MURTAUGH  WITHOUT  MISSING  A  BEAT.  CUTS
     HIM LOOSE WITH  A  BORROWED  KNIFE.

                         RIGGS
               WORK  YOUR  CIRCULATION.

     CROSSES TO RIANNE, CUTS  HER  FREE.  SHE  COLLAPSES  SOBBING
     INTO HIS ARMS.

                         RIGGS
               SSSHHH-  NO TIME.  COME ON.

     HE SCOOPS UP HANDGUNS,  THROWS  THEM  TO  MURTAUGH.  TAKES
     FOR HIMSELF A PUMP SHOTGUN, POSSIBLY  THE  SAME  ONE  USED
     AGAINST HIM EARLIER.  MURTAUGH STARES DUMBFOUNDED AT THE
     BODY COUNT.

                         RIGGS
               THEY'RE ALL DEAD.  LET'S GET
               OUT OF HERE.

143  EXT. HALLWAY -  SAME  TIME                             143

     THE THREE OF THEM.

     ON THE RUN, MOVING HARD AND  FAST.  THEY  SCRAMBLE  DOWN  THE
     HALLWAY, RIGGS IN THE LEAD, AS -- A  MERC  DUCKS  AROUND  THE
     CORNER, SEES THEM.  DUCKS BACK.  RIGGS FIRES THROUGH THE
     WALL, BLAM -- !  A CORPSE FALLS INTO VIEW.  THEY KEEP
     MOVING.  DOWNSTAIRS.  A-ROUND ANOTHER CORNER.  MOVING,
     MOVING.

     THE THREE OF THEM  KEEP  MOVING.  RUSHING  HEADLONG  TOWARD
     A SIGN MARKED EXIT. THEY MAY ACTUALLY MAKE  IT  ...  OR  NOT.
     FOR AT THAT MOMENT, MR. JOSHUA LOOMS  UP  BEHIND  THEM  AND
     TOSSES SOMETHING IN THEIR  DIRECTION.  DUCKS  BACK  OUT  OF
     SIGHT. IT'S A LIVE  GRENADE.  THE  GRENADE  HITS  THE  FLOOR.
     CLATTERS.  RIGGS STOPS INSTANTLY.  HE KNOWS THE SOUND.
     SPINS. DIVES. SCOOPS UP  THE  GRENDADE  AND  CHUCKS  IT  WITH
     ALL HIS MIGHT. IT BOUNCES  DOWNSTAIRS  AND  EXPLODES  AT  THE
     FOOT OF THE STEPS.

144  EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT                                          144

     JOSHUA SKIDS TO A HALT NEXT TO A SEDAN.

     HE SLAMS THE DOOR AND ROARS  OFF  DOWN  HOLLYWOOD  BOULEVARD.
     THE CROWD PARTS LIKE THE RED SEA.  PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING.
     AND SUDDENLY, THE DOORS BURST OPEN -- AS RIGGS, MURTAUGH
     AND RIANNE COME SKIDDING OUT ONTO THE SIDEWALK IN HOT
     PURSUIT.  MURTAUGH SHOVES HIS DAUGHTER BACK AS JOSHUA
     FIRES OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAR.  BULLETS LASH THE PAVE-
     MENT.  THE CROWD SHRIEKS.  THE CAR SCREECHES AWAY.

145  ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  145

     A BEAT COP COMES RUNNING UP,  AND  MURTAUGH  SHOVES  RIANNE
     IN HIS DIRECTION.  FLASHES HIS BADGE.

                         MURTAUGH
               GET HER OUT OF HERE.

146  ANOTHER ANGLE - MURTAUGH AND RIGGS                             146

     GO RUNNING AFTER THE CAR.  SIDE BY SIDE.  BEATEN.  BLOODY.
     NAKED FROM THE WAIST UP.  MURTAUGH FIRING HIS PISTOL.  SHOT
     AFTER BLAZING SHOT.

     RIGGS UNLOADING WITH THE M-16 ON THREE-SHOT MODE, THE
     MUZZLE FLASH BLINDING, THE NOISE DEAFENING -- UNTIL
     PEDESTRIANS SWARM SUDDENLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE.
     BLOCKING THEM. EXCEPT  MURTAUGH  WON'T  GIVE  UP.  HE  RUNS
     AFTER THE CAR, SHOUTING:

                         MURTAUGH
               OUT OF THE WAY.  MOVE.

     HIS GUN CLICKS  EMPTY.  HE  TOSSES  IT  ASIDE.  PULLS  ANOTHER
     FROM HIS WAISTBAND.  THE  CAR.  FAR  AWAY.  FIRES  FOUR  MORE
     SHOTS.  COLLAPSES IN THE STREET.  NEARLY' UNCONSCIOUS.
     CRAWLS FORWARD AFTER THE CAR, BLOOD  STREAMING  FROM  HIS
     BROKEN NOSE ... GOING ON SHEER  GUTS.  FINALLY  GIVES  OUT.
     SLUMPS IN A HEAP. RIGGS KNEELS BESIDE  HIM  AS  A  POLICE  CAR
     ROARS UP TO THEM, FLASHERS  SPINNING.  RIGGS  IS  A  MAN  POS-
     SESSED. WE PANA-GLIDE  WITH  HIM  AS  HE  RUNS  FORWARD.  M-16
     IN ONE HAND.  BADGE IN THE OTHER.

                         RIGGS
               GET AN AMBULANCE!!

     HE TAKES OFF AFTER THE JOSHUA'S CAR.  ON FOOT.  SOMEONE
     BETTER TELL THIS GUY TO LIGHTEN UP.  THE CAR IS FAR AHEAD,
     RACING ONTO A FREEWAY ON-RAMP.  RIGGS RUNS.  SWEAT POURS
     OFF HIM.  SEEING THE CAR ON THE RAMP, HE CHANGES DIRECTION.
     STARTS RUNNING AN INTERCEPT  COURSE.  LEAPS  OUT  INTO  THE
     STREET -- SPINS, AS A TRUCK  BLARES  OUT  OF  NOWHERE,  BRAKES
     SQUEALING, HORN  SHRIEKING.  SOMERSAULTS  OVER  THE  HOOD.
     LANDS.  KEEPS  MOVING.  BARRELS  ACROSS  THE  STREET.   FASTER
     NOW.  EVEN FASTER THAN BEFORE.  FEET POUNDING.  GUN
     SWINGING.  DASHING  OUT  ONTO  THE  FREEWAY  OVERPASS.  WHERE,
     WITHOUT STOPPING,  HE  PROMPTLY  JUMPS  THE  GUARDRAIL.  DROPS
     THROUGH SPACE ... AND LANDS, THUMP -- !  ATOP THE BIG
     GREEN FREEWAY SIGN.  SWINGS LIKE AN ACROBAT.  DANGLES
     FROM THE SIGN, TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.  LEVELS THE
     M-16 ONE-HANDED, SWITCHES IT TO FULL AUTO.  WAITS ...

147  BENEATH HIM                                                     147

     JOSHUA'S CAR COMES  SCREAMING  THROUGH  THE  UNDERPASS,  DOING
     EIGHTY. RIGGS UNLEASHES  THE  GUN.  IT  BLAZES  WITH  CRUEL
     FIRE. STPAFES THE BACK  OF  THE  CAR.  SURE  ENOUGH,  BLOWS
     OUT BOTH TIRES -- THROWING THE  VEHICLE  INTO  A  DEADLY  SKID
     -- SLEWING ACROSS THE FREEWAY  --  STRIKING  THE  GUARDRAIL
     AT SIXTY-PLUS. IT SLIDES  FOR  A  FULL  HUNDRED  YARDS,  SEND-
     ING UP A SHOWER OF  SPARKS.  THE  BACK  TIRES  DISINTEGRATE
     IN A TRAIL OF BURNING RUBBER.  THE CAR GRINDS TO A HALT.
     THE DOOR OPENS  AND  JOSHUA  ROLLS  OUT.  RIGGS  FIRES.  KICKS
     UP A CLOUD OF CEMENT  NEAR  THE  MERC.  JOSHUA  RETURNS  FIRE.

148  ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   148

     BIG CHUNKS OF THE.FREEWAY SIGN BLOW  OUT  NEXT  TO  RIGGS'
     .HEAD.  HE IS SHOWERED WITH WOODEN DEBRIS.

     RIGGS LOWERS THE GUN.  LETS GO AND DROPS TWENTY FEET TO
     THE PAVEMENT.  LANDS, ROLLS, COMES UP.  A CAR SWERVES
     AROUND HIM.  CRASHES INTO THE GUARDRAIL.  RIGGS DOESN'T
     EVEN LOOK.  INSTEAD, HE BEGINS TO WALK.  HE IS A FUCKING
     JUGGERNAUT.

149  UP AHEAD                                                    149

     JOSHUA TURNS, SEES RIGGS -- AND STOPS.

                         JOSHUA
               OKAY, YOU BASTARD, LET'S SEE
               WHO'S BETTER.

     THEY ARE SEPARATED BY PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS.  JOSHUA
     SNAPS HIS RIFLE TO HIS SHOULDER. EYES GLUED TO  THE  SCOPE.
     RIGGS SWINGS HIS OWN RIFLE INTO POSITION -- AND  WE'VE  GOT
     THE SHOWDOWN AT THE O.K. CORRAL. A  BATTLE  OF  WITS.  EACH
     ONE SCANNING THROUGH THE SCOPE.

     LOOKING FOR A CLEAR SHOT, AS CARS SWERVE AROUND AND
     BETWEEN THEM. THE CROSSHAIRS  SWEEP  THE  FREEWAY.  PERFECT
     CONCENTRATION.  RIGGS.  JOSHUA.  TWO SOLDIERS.  AND
     SUDDENLY, THE SHOT IS THERE:  JOSHUA SIGHTS IN ON RIGGS'
     POSITION. ONLY PROBLEM IS, RIGGS' RIFLE  IS  POINTED  RIGHT
     AT THE CAMERA. HE IS SIGHTED IN  ON  JOSHUA.  SIMULTANEOUS.
     THEY FIRE AT THE EXACT SAME MOMENT.  TWO SHOTS.  TWO
     DISTINCT RIFLE CRACKS.  RIGGS TAKES IT IN THE SHOULDER.
     BLOWN BACKWARD.  JOSHUA GOES DOWN, WINGED.  RIGGS.
     JOSHUA.  EACH LOOKS LIKE SHIT.  THEY STRUGGLE TO THEIR
     FEET ... AND THAT'S WHEN A CAR BACKS UP INTO RIGGS AT
     THIRTY MILES AN HOUR. BROADSIDES  HIM.  SENDS  HIM  FLYING.

150  UP AHEAD                                                     150

     JOSHUA RUSHES UP TO A STALLED CAR. THROWS  OPEN  THE  DOOR.
     YANKS OUT THE DRIVER, HOPS BEHIND THE  WHEEL.  ROARS  AWAY.

                                               CUT TO:

151  EXT. BUILDING - SAME TIME                                    151

     AN AMBULANCE SHUDDERS TO A HALT AND TWO ORDERLIES HOP
     OUT.  UNIFORMED COPS ARE STRUGGLING TO HOLD BACK THE
     CROWD.  ONE OF THE ORDERLIES RUSHES UP.

                         ORDERLY
               WHERE IS HE, OFFICER?

                         COP
               RIGHT OVER THERE.

     HE POINTS -- AND SUDDENLY FROWNS: THERE IS  NO  ONE  THERE.
     MURTAUGH IS GONE.  NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

                                                       CUT TO:

152  EXT. BACK ALLEY - SAME TIME                                   152

     A SLEEK BLACK VAN CAREENS AROUND THE CORNER.

152A INT. VAN                                                      152A

     A MERC IS DRIVING, FOOT GLUED TO THE PEDAL.  THE GENERAL
     SITS SWEATING IN THE BACK SEAT.

152B ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 152B

     THE HEADLIGHTS FLASH WILDLY AS THE CAR ROARS DOWN THE
     ALLEY.

     THE GENERAL STARES AHEAD, AND SUDDENLY ------- ...
     'CAUSE WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, THERE'S ROGER MURTAUGH.
     FIFTY YARDS AWAY.  STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.

153  ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 153

     THERE IS NO REASON FOR MURTAUGH TO BE STANDING.  HE IS A
     WALKING TESTAMENT TO MAN'S ABILITY TO BLOODY HIMSELF.
     AND HE'S PISSED... THE MERC  SEES  HIM,  SNARLS  --  PUNCHES
     THE GAS.  MURTAUGH HOLDS HIS GROUND.  HE CAN BARELY STAND.
     AND THEN HE DOES A PECULIAR THING:  HE EXAMINES HIS HAND.
     NO QUESTION.  A DEFINITE TREMBLE.  SCOWLS.  STRETCHES.
     CRACKS HIS NECK.

     SHIFTS FROM FOOT TO FOOT, STEADYING HIMSELF.  HE HAS ONE
     SHOT. THE NUMBERS ARE  FALLING,  IT'S  ALL  COMING  DOWN  --
     AND HE'S READY.  THE VAN COMES BARRELING IN.  DOING FIFTY.
     NOW OR NEVER...

                         MURTAUGH
               NO WAY YOU LIVE.  NO WAY.

     HE CROSS-DRAWS WITH LIGHTNING SWIFTNESS.  BAM.  THE
     REPORT IS DEAFENING.  THE WINDSHIELD PROMPTLY SHATTERS.
     AND THE MERC SPROUTS A NEAT THIRD EYE.  PERFECT SHOT.
     DEAD CENTER.  THE VAN SWERVES.  MURTAUGH STEPS OUT OF THE
     WAY.  DEADLY CALM.  AS THE VAN CAREENS PAST -- HE SALUTES
     THE GENERAL.  WATCHES, EXPRESSIONLESS ... THE CAR SLAMS
     INTO A TELEPHONE POLE AND ROLLS OVER.  GRINDING METAL.
     AN ERUPTION OF GLASS.  IT CONTINUES TO ROLL LIKE SOME
     GREAT BEAST, CRUMPLING  AND  FOLDING  LIKE  AN  ACCORDION...

     COMES TO REST, UPSIDE DOWN IN A SEA OF GLASS ...

153A INT. VAN                                             153A

     THE GENERAL IS PINNED BENEATH A CRUMPLED DOOR-FRAME,
     STRUGGLING TO BREAK FREE, AS FLAMES LICK UPWARD FROM THE
     RUPTURED GAS TANK...

     AND THEN THE GENERAL SEES SOMETHING WHICH RUINS HIS WHOLE
     DAY.

     THE MERC'S CORPSE,  SPRAWLED  OVER  THE  STEERING  COLUMN...     *
     WITH A SHINY METAL GRENADE ATTACHED TO HIS BELT.                 *
     FLAMES DANCE AROUND THE GRENADE.                                 *

153C ANOTHER ANGLE                                                    153C *

     THE GENERAL SQUIRMS, STRAINS, YANKS FOR ALL HE'S WORTH...        *
     FINGERS REACHING OUT FOR THE GRENADE...........................  *
     FLAMES BURNING HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND...........................  *

     AND IT IS, AS THEY SAY, ALL SHE WROTE.                           *
154  EXT. ROADWAY                                                     154

     MURTAUGH IS WALKING LIKE A ZOMBIE.  AWAY FROM THE VAN.
     GUN HELD LOOSELY AT HIS  SIDE.  SUDDENLY  --  IT  BLOWS  SKY
     HIGH.  A TOWER OF FIRE.  BLOWS MURTAUGH FLAT.  KNOCKS
     HIM ASS OVER TEACUPS.  ECHOES DOWN THE STREET.  TURNS
     NIGHT INTO DAY FOR ONE  BRIEF  INSTANT.  AND  THEN  --  THEN
     SOMETHING TRULY  INCREDIBLE  HAPPENS.  FOR  THE  FIRST  TIME
     IN NEARLY A CENTURY -- IT BEGINS TO SNOW IN HOLLYWOOD.
     MURTAUGH LOOKS UP, A "WHAT THE HELL ... ?" EXPRESSION ON
     HIS FACE.  SURE ENOUGH --

155  HEROIN                                                           155

     IS SIFTING DOWN ON THE NIGHT AIR, TEN MILLION DOLLARS'
     WORTH... A CLOUD OVER THE ENTIRE' STREET.  SWIRLING IN
     THE BREEZE.

156  MURTAUGH                                                    156

     GETS SLOWLY TO HIS FEET, CHECKING FOR BROKEN BONES.  IF
     IT WASN'T BUSTED ALREADY, APPARENTLY IT'S OKAY NOW.  TIME
     PASSES.  A HAND RESTS ON HIS SHOULDER.

157  MARTIN RIGGS                                                157

     STANDS NEXT TO HIM.  COPS SWARM BEHIND THEM.  THE HEROIN
     SNOW CONTINUES TO FALL.  THE WRECK BURNS.  RIGGS LOOKS AT
     MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH LOOKS AT RIGGS.  THE TWO MOST PHYSI-
     CALLY ABUSED MEN IN FILM HISTORY.

                         MURTAUGH
               WELL, SHIT.

                         RIGGS
               TRY NOT TO BREATHE, YOU'LL SEE
               PINK ELEPHANTS.

                         MURTAUGH
               JOSHUA?

                         RIGGS
               GOT AWAY.

                         MURTAUGH
               WE ... GOTTA FIND HIM.

                         RIGGS
               NO DICE.  FIRST THING WE GOTTA DO
               IS GET YOU TO A HOSPITAL.

                         MURTAUGH
               UH-HUH  FIRST THING WE GOTTA DO
               IS CHECK ON MY HOUSE.
                    (BEAT)
               I GOT A BAD FEELING...

     HE MOVES AWAY.  RIGGS STARTS TO FOLLOW.  GOES TO TOSS HIS
     CIGARETTE IN THE GUTTER, AND STOPS:  THERE IS A TINY, RED
     MARK AT THE TIP OF THE FILTER:  IT IS THE CIGARETTE.  THE
     VERY LAST ONE ... HE STARES AT IT, A SUDDEN GLIMMER IN HIS
     EYE.

                                             CUT TO:

158  EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT                                  158

     THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS SHED A HAPPY GLOW.  THE LAWN IS
     STILL LITTERED WITH TOYS.  TWO UNIFORMED COPS ARE WATCH-
     ING OVER THE HOUSE, SITTING IN A POLICE CAR ACROSS THE
     STREET.  ONE OF THEM MUNCHES ON A SANDWICH.  THE OTHER
     IS DOING A CROSSWORD PUZZLE.  A CAR PULLS UP NEXT TO
     THEM.  THE DOOR OPENS -- OUT STEPS MR. JOSHUA.

                         POLICE OFFICER
               EXCUSE ME, SIR, MAY I SEE SOME
               ID?

     JOSHUA TAKES AN UZI FROM BENEATH  HIS  COAT.  NO  HESI-
     TATION. BLOWS  THEM  APART.  WALKS  FORWARD,  GUN  SMOKING.
     CROSSES THE LAWN TO THE FRONT DOOR.  KICKS IT TO
     SPLINTERS.

159  EXT. CITY STREET - SAME TIME                                   159

     A POLICE CAR PEELS AROUND THE CORNER.  TAKES OUT A
     SALVATION ARMY BUCKET, WHICH POPS LIKE A CLAY DUCK.
     COINS SHOWER EVERY WHICH WAY.

160  INT. CAR                                                       160

     MURTAUGH IS DRIVING LIKE A  LUNATIC.  BESIDE  HIM,  RIGGS
     HOLDS A HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS GUNSHOT WOUND.

161  INT. MURTAUGH HOME'- SAME TIME                                 161

     JOSHUA STALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY OF MURTAUGH'S HOUSE.
     STOPS IN FRONT OF THE BEDROOM DOOR.  HOLY JESUS ...   HE
     KICKS IT OPEN.  SPPAYS  THE  INTERIOR  WITH  GUNFIRE.  SHREDS
     THE MATTRESS, DICES  THE  PILLOWS.  TRASHES  EVERYTHING  IN
     SIGHT:  STAR WARS POSTERS.  STUFFED ANIMALS.  STEREO.
     EMPTIES AN ENTIRE CLIP OF  .9  MILLIMETER  SLUGS.  EXCEPT
     THE BED IS EMPTY. THERE  IS  NO  ONE  THERE.  JOSHUA  SNARLS.
     TURNS.

162  SERIES OF SHOTS                                                162

     KICKS OPEN ANOTHER DOOR.  TRIGGERS DESTRUCTION.  PLASTER
     AND WOOD FILL THE AIR IN  A  CLOUD.  ROOM  TO  ROOM.  SEARCH-
     ING. GROWING MORE AND MORE  ENRAGED  --  BECAUSE  THERE  IS
     NO ONE HERE TO KILL. HE IS BLOWING THE  SHIT  OUT  OF  AN
     EMPTY SANTA MONICA BUNGALOW.  HE BURSTS INTO THE ONLY
     ROOM HE HASN'T VISITED.  LIVING ROOM.  IT TOO, IS EMPTY.
     THERE IS A NOTE, HOWEVER.  TAPED  TO  THE  CHRISTMAS  TREE:
     BIG LETTERS.

     DEAR BADGUYS

     NO ONE HERE BUT US COPS.
     SORRY.

     -- THE GOODGUYS

     JOSHUA SWEARS. RUNS FOR THE  DOOR.  AND  A  POLICE  CAR
     DRIVES THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE  HOUSE.  PLOWS  INTO  THE
     LIVING ROOM, SHEARING BOARDS  IN  HALF,  BURSTING  WINDOWS,
     GRINDING TO A HAL-. IN A SEA OF  GLASS.  JOSHUA  SPINS,
     TRIGGERING THE UZI.-  STRAFES THE CAR.  A WITHERING FIRE.

     EMPTIES AN ENTIRE CLIP AT  THE  FRONT  WINDSHIELD,  DICING
     IT TO SMITHEREENS. WAVES THE  GUN  LIKE  A  WAND,  STRAFING
     X PATTERNS, FIRING ALL THE WHILE, COMPLETELY EXTINGUISH-
     ING THE CAR AND ALL LIFE WITHIN.  STOPS.  SILENCE.
     FLOATING DEBRIS.  JOSHUA LOWERS THE GUN.  BREATHING HARD.

     CROSSES  THE ROOM, HIS BOOTS CRUNCHING THROUGH BROKEN
     GLASS.   YANKS ON THE DRIVER'S DOOR.  IT FALLS LOOSE WITH
     A METAL  CLANG.

163  ANOTHER  ANGLE                                             163

     A COP'S  NIGHTSTICK HAS BEEN JAMMED AGAINST THE ACCEL-
     ERATOR PEDAL.  THE CAR IS EMPTY.

     JOSHUA SPINS, STARTLED
     STARES ACROSS THE ROOM

     AT MARTIN RIGGS, WHO SITS CALMLY  ON  THE  WINDOWSILL.

                         RIGGS
               HO, HO, HO.

     HE RAISES HIS GUN AND FIRES WITHOUT BLINKING.
     BLOWS THE GUN OUT OF JOSHUA'S HANDS.
     SMILES A BIG SHIT-EATING GRIN.

     JOSHUA TURNS AND DIVES THROUGH THE HOLE  IN  THE  WALL
     LANDS OUTSIDE, COMES UP RUNNING, BUT  SORRY,  NO  DICE
     BECAUSE THERE STANDS ROGER  MURTAUGH.  DRAWING  A  BEAD  ON
     JOSHUA'S RUNNING FIGURE.

                         MURTAUGH
               FREEZE, JOSHUA.

     JOSHUA STOPS DEAD. TURNS,  GROWLING  LOW  IN  HIS  THROAT.
     A FIRE HYDRANT, SHEARED OFF BY  THE  RUNAWAY  CAR,  SPRAYS
     WATER HIGH INTO THE NIGHTTIME  AIR.  THE  WIND  BLOWS.
     MARTIN RIGGS STEPS OUT OF  THE  HOUSE.  POINTING  THE  .38
     SPECIAL LIKE A FINGER OF DOOM.  STROLLS TOWARD MR.
     JOSHUA... THE GUN IS ROCK  STEADY.  RIGGS'  EYES  MEET
     MURTAUGH'S, AND HE SPEAKS WITH DEADLY PURPOSE:

                         RIGGS
               I'LL HANDLE IT.

     HE STEPS UP TO JOSHUA.  SMILES.  AND  THEN  HE  DOES  SOME-
     THING VERY STRANGE: HE RELAXES HIS  GRIP  ON  THE  GUN  --
     AND THROWS IT AWAY.  FACES JOSHUA.  RAISES HIS ARMS, AND
     CAREFULLY PLACES THEM BEHIND  HIS  HEAD.  WHEN  HE  SPEAKS,
     HIS VOICE DRIPS MENACE:

                         RIGGS
               COME ON, ACE.
                    (BEAT)
               TRY ME.

     A MOMENT. THEN JOSHUA CALMLY PLANTS  HIMSELF  IN  FRONT  OF
     RIGGS.  AROUND THEM, WATER SHOWERS DOWN IN A GENTLE CLOUD.
     SIRENS APPROACH IN THE NEAR  DISTANCE.  JOSHUA  AND  RIGGS.
     TWO SOLDIERS.  THEIR EYES LOCK.  AND YOU BETTER HANG ONTO
     YOUR POPCORN, BOYS AND GIRLS, BECAUSE IT'S  ABOUT  TO  GET
     UGLY.

                         JOSHUA
               DON'T MIND IF I DO.

     AND SO IT BEGINS.  THEY START TO CIRCLE.

     RIGGS AND JOSHUA, PERFECT CONCENTRATION,  ROUND  AND  ROUND
     AND NEVER, NEVER ONCE DOES THEIR FOCUS BREAK, BECAUSE,
     BABY, THESE GUYS ARE PROS -- AND  HERE'S  SOMETHING  FUNNY:
     THEY AREN'T LOOKING AT EACH OTHER'S  EYES  AT  ALL.  RATHER
     -- THEY'RE WATCHING EACH OTHER'S HANDS.

164  RIGGS                                                        164

     HIS FINGERS TWITCH. FLEX.  WRIST  MAKING  SLOW,  LABORIOUS-
     CIRCLES.

165  JOSHUA                                                       165

     SHIFTING FROM LEG TO LEG, FLOATING HIS BALANCE.

166  MURTAUGH                                                     166

     LOOKS ON, SWEATING IT OUT. HE'S  NOT  HAPPY,  HE  WANTS  TO
     END IT ... AND YET HE WAITS.

167  RIGGS AND JOSHUA                                             167

     ALL WE SEE IS THEIR  EYES,  STRAINING,  FOCUSING,  SCANNING
     FOR AN OPENING.

                         JOSHUA
               CONCENTRATE, MARTIN... DON'T GIVE
               ME AN OPENING... WOULDN'T WANT TO
               DO THAT ...

     MEANWHILE, IS RAISING HIS GUN, POINTING IT AT JOSHUA.
     RIGGS' VOICE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE:

                         RIGGS
               NO. ROGER.
                    (BEAT)
               NO WAY.

     MURTAUGH LOWERS THE GUN.  STARES, FASCINATED, AT THIS
     CONTEST BETWEEN TWO CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONALS.  IN FOR THE
     KILL.  IT IS A DANCE OF THE FORCES.  RIGGS IS ON FIRE.
     LEAPS, AVOIDING A SHOT TO THE KNEE, SPINS, SLAMS THE
     KNUCKLES OF HIS HAND INTO JOSHUA'S NOSE.  BUSTS IT.
     JOSHUA SNARLS, DROPS -- CATCHES RIGGS' ARM OVER ONE
     SHOULDER.  AND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... RIGGS HAS JUST
     FUCKED UP.  CRACK -- !  HIS ARM BREAKS.  HE SCREAMS WITH
     PAIN.  SCREAMS WITH ANGER.  TOSSES THREE SHOTS AT JOSHUA.

               LIFE'S TOUGH THAT WAY ... OH, BY
               THE WAY:  FUCK YOU.

     HE LAUNCHES HIMSELF AT JOSHUA.  JOSHUA STRIKES, SCORES A
     MINOR POINT, BREAKING RIGGS' COLLARBONE, EXCEPT RIGGS
     DOESN'T CARE, NOSIRREE BOB... 'CAUSE HE JUST HIT PAYDIRT:
     JOSHUA'S KNEE.  BOOT-STRIKES, BAM -- !  SHEARING THE
     KNEE, MAYBE BURSTING THE CAP ... JOSHUA SHRIEKS, BUT THEN
     AGAIN, SO WOULD YOU.  AND HE PROMPTLY JACK-KNIVES HIS
     FIST RIGHT INTO RIGGS' BROKEN ARM.  THREE TIMES.  RIGGS
     BELLOWS.  REFUSES TO QUIT.

     SLAMS HIS HEAD INTO JOSHUA'S BUSTED NOSE.  POP ...
     DOES IT AGAIN. JOSHUA, HAMMERING THE  BROKEN  ARM.  POW.
     (SCREAM)  POW.  (SCREAM) ... UNTIL, SON OF A BITCH... THE
     PAIN IS SIMPLY TOO INTENSE... NOTHING HUMAN CAN WITHSTAND
     IT, THEY FALL AWAY, STAGGERING, WRENCHING TO A SHAKY HALT,
     FACING ONE ANOTHER, STANDOFF ... EXHAUSTED, LIMPING, HARDLY
     ABLE TO SPEAK...

     PULLING UP NOW, COPS STUMBLING OUT, GUNS CLEARING  THEIR
     HOLSTERS AS MURTAUGH WAVES FRANTICALLY, SCREAMS:

     SPITS, GAZES STRAIGHT AT JOSHUA.  JOSHUA STARES BACK.
     TWO SOLDIERS.  THIS CLOSE TO COLLAPSING.  UNTIL, BREAKING
     THE SILENCE -- COMES MURTAUGH'S VOICE:

                         MURTAUGH
               MARTIN.

                         RIGGS
               YEAH.

                            MURTAUGH
               -----------
               THE MOTHERFUCKER.

     A MOMENT ... AND THEN, MY FRIENDS, RIGGS DOES A PECULIAR
     THING:  HE SMILES THEN.  DAMNED IF HE DOESN'T.  AND RISES
     UP ... STANDING. STANDING STRAIGHT. THERE IS NO  WAY  HE
     SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS.  AND THEN HE SPEAKS, AND IT'S
     LIKE THE VOICE OF DOOM, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE KNOW THAT
     THIS GUY IS A FUCKING LEGEND, WE KNOW WHY THE V.C. EN-
     FORCERS WHISPERED HIS NAME AT NIGHT IN THE FOXHOLES ...
     HE IS RIGGS.  AND NO ONE CAN TOUCH HIM.  NO ONE.

                         RIGGS
               LAST CHANCE.  WALK AWAY.

                         JOSHUA
               FUCK YOURSELF.

                         RIGGS
               FINE.  DIE.

     HE STEPS FORWARD.  STANDS.  JOSHUA SPRINGS -- THUNDERS
     HIS FOOT INTO RIGGS' HIP, SEPARATING THE BONE AT THE
     JOINT ... AND RIGGS DOESN'T BLINK.  HIS HAND COMES OUT.
     LIGHTNING QUICK.

     THERE IS A SICK-SOUNDING CRACK -- AND JOSHUA IS DEAD
     BEFORE HE HITS THE GROUND.  RIGGS HOVERS OVER THE
     CORPSE... BREATHING SPASTIC, SALIVA DRIPPING FROM HIS
     LIPS... TAKES A HANDKERCHIEF, WIPES HIS HAND, AND SAYS:

                         RIGGS
               YOU LOSE.

     AT WHICH POINT, HE COLLAPSES LIKE A SACK OF GRAIN.

     IS RUNNING FORWARD, TEARS IN HIS EYES BY THIS TIME, FALLS
     TO HIS KNEES, CRADLING RIGGS IN HIS ARMS, WHILE THE
     ASSEMBLED COPS LOOK ON IN THOROUGHLY STUNNED SILENCE,
     WHAT THEY HAVE JUST SEEN IS BEYOND THEIR WILDEST
     IMAGINING ...

173  ON GROUND                                                        173

     RIGGS LOOKS AT MURTAUGH.  MURTAUGH LOOKS AT RIGGS.

                         MURTAUGH
               TAKE IT EASY, MARTIN...

                         RIGGS
               ... RIGHT.  EASY.  YOU BET ...

                         MURTAUGH
               DOES IT HURT ... ?

     RIGGS  THROWS  HIM  A  LOOK.

                         RIGGS
               WHAT ARE YOU, AN IDIOT?

                         MURTAUGH
               SORRY.

                         RIGGS
               ... GOOD NEWS IS, I'M NOT DEAD...

                         MURTAUGH
               WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?

     RIGGS GRIMACES IN PAIN-

                         RIGGS
               ... BAD NEWS IS, I'M STILL ALIVE ...

     HE CHUCKLES.  GROANS.  PASSES OUT.  THE WATER RAINS
     STEADILY DOWN.  THE NIGHT WEARS ON...

     CUT TO:

174  EXT. LONG BEACH BAR - DAY                                  174

     CHRISTMAS CAROLERS SING OUTSIDE AT ROADSIDE.  A BIG
     BANNER SCREAMS MERRY CHRISTMAS TO PASSING CARS.  CHRIST-
     MAS LIGHTS.  TINSEL.  MURTAUGH AND RIGGS STAND ON THE
     SIDEWALK, HUDDLED AGAINST THE CHILL.  RIGGS STANDS,

               GUESS I WON'T BE SEEING YOU
               AROUND.

               GUESS NOT.
                    (BEAT)
               THE DEPARTMENT THINKS I'M WILD.
               I DON'T BELONG ANYMORE.  NOT
               HERE.

                         MURTAUGH

               WHO KNOWS ... ?  MAYBE I CAN GET
               A JOB ON A REMAKE OF COBRA.

                         MURTAUGH
               MY SON WOULD COME SEE YOU.

                         RIGGS
               HE'D BE THE ONLY ONE.

                         MURTAUGH

                     THEN)

                         RIGGS
               DON'T  YOU  DARE.

     MURTAUGH LOOKS AT HIM.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'RE TOO OLD TO CHANGE NOW,
               COLCHISE.

                         RIGGS
               YOU JUST HANG IN THERE.

                         MURTAUGH
               YEAH.  YOU, TOO.

                         RIGGS
               GUESS I'LL SAY GOODBYE.

               SURE.  COME OVER FOR DINNER
               SOMETIME.

                         RIGGS
               NO, THANKS.

                         MURTAUGH
               DON'T BLAME YOU.  I'M THINKING
               OF ARRESTING MY WIFE FOR CRUELTY
               TO BACON.
                    (BEAT)

                         RIGGS
               MERRY CHRISTMAS.

     HE WALKS OFF DOWN THE STREET.  MURTAUGH WATCHES HIM GO.
     PAUSE.  TURNS UP HIS COLLAR AGAINST THE CHILL, TAKES A
     FEW STEPS ... AND A MAN STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM.  THE SAME
     PUNK WHO RIGGS BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF AT THE VERY BEGINNING
     OF THE FILM.

                         PUNK
               HEY, OLD MAN, GOT ANY MONEY?

     MURTAUGH STOPS.  STARES.  BLINKS.  AND PROCEEDS TO KICK
     THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.  A KICK.  A PUNCH.  THE PUNK LIES
     ON THE SIDEWALK, SEMI-CONSCIOUS.  MURTAUGH SCOWLS AND
     SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               I'M FIFTY.  THAT'S NOT OLD,
               DICKLESS.

175  EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK (SAME DAY)                            175

     RAIN POURS DOWN. MARTIN RIGGS STANDS OVER A  LONE  GRAVE.
     THERE ARE DARK HOLLOWS UNDER HIS EYES. THE WIND  TUGS  AT
     HIS HAIR.  THE TOMBSTONE READS:

     VICTORIA LYNN RIGGS

     BORN:  1953
     DIED:  1984

     HE REACHES BENEATH HIS OVERCOAT AND REMOVES A BRIGHT
     GREEN CHRISTMAS WREATH, WHICH HE PLACES ATOP THE GRAVE.
     KISSES HIS FINGERTIPS. PRESSES THEM TO THE  MOIST  EARTH.

                         RIGGS
               MERRY CHRISTMAS.
                    (BEAT)
               I LOVE YOU.

     THE RAINS STARTS TO FALL.  RIGGS IS OBLIVIOUS.

176  EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT                                 176

     CARPENTERS ARE AT WORK, PATCHING AND REPAIRING.  THE
     CHRISTMAS LIGHTS STILL SHINE DEFIANTLY. A CAR PULLS  UP.

                                                       CUT TO:

177     FRONT  DOOR                                           177

     AS A HAND KNOCKS SOFTLY:  THE DOOR OPENS -- AND THERE
     STANDS YOUNG RIANNE.  ADORABLE.  SHE LOOKS UP AT THE
     VISITOR... IT IS MARTIN RIGGS.

                         RIANNE
               HI.

                         RIGGS
               HI.

     HE HANDS SOMETHING TO HER.  SHE TAKES IT.  THE BOTTLE OF
     PILLS.  IT HAS A RED RIBBON TIED AROUND IT.

                         RIGGS
               GIVE THAT TO YOUR DAD.  IT'S A
               PRESENT.  TELL HIM I WON'T BE
               NEEDING THEM ANYMORE.

     RIANNE NODS.

                         RIANNE
               OKAY.  YOU WANNA COME IN?  WE'RE
               BUILDING.

     RIGGS THINKS IT OVER.  SHAKES HIS HEAD:

                         RIGGS
               NO, THAT'S OKAY.
                    (BEAT)
               YOU HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS,
               MISSY.

                         RIANNE
               OKAY.

     RIGGS TURNS TO GO.  RIANNE STOPS HIM:

                         RIANNE
               THEY SAY YOU'RE THE BEST.

     BEAT.  HE STOPS.  TURNS AND LOOKS AT HER.

                         RIANNE
               ARE YOU?

                         RIGGS
                    (BIG SMILE; WILD WINK)
               NO ONE CAN TOUCH ME.

     RIANNE BLUSHES.

     RIGGS BEGINS TO WALK AWAY, INTO THE RAIN...

     UNTIL ROGER MURTAUGH APPEARS FROM INSIDE THE BOAT ON THE
     TRAILER HITCH.

     HE STANDS ON DECK AND LOOKS DOWN AT RIGGS.

     RIGGS STOPS.  THEY STAND THERE IN THE RAIN FOR A MOMENT.
     THEN MURTAUGH LOOKS HIM SQUARE IN THE EYE AND SAYS:

                         MURTAUGH
               SUCKER, IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA CAT
               THE WORLD'S LOUSIEST CHRISTMAS
               TURKEY ALL BY MY LONESOME, YOU'RE
               NUTS.

     RIGGS NODS.  A MOMENT PASSES.  THEN:

                         RIGGS
               I THINK YOUR DAUGHTER KINDA LIKES
               ME.

                         MURTAUGH
               YOU TOUCH HER, I'LL KILL YOU.

                         RIGGS
               YOU'LL TRY.

     HE SMILES.

     MURTAUGH SMILES.

     THE RAIN FALLS, AS THEY ENTER THE HOUSE TOGETHER, AND
     WE

                                                  FADE OUT.

STEP ON IT!

LOOK OUT!

SEE YOU!

I'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR LICENSE AND PROOF OF INSURANCE!

WE GOT ONE. YOURS IS GOING UP THE HILL.

SO IS RIGGS, ON FOOT!

HEY, RIGGS! GET YOUR SLOW ASS IN HERE!

GET IN HERE, NOW!

ONLY IF I DRIVE.

MOVE OVER. I'LL DRIVE.

NO, GO AROUND. I'M DRIVING.

I'LL DRIVE.

DID YOU GET A MAKE ON THAT RED BEEMER?

NOT ONE SCRATCH, YOU HEAR?

- YOU WON'T MAKE IT. - I WILL.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM!

YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT!

LOOK AT MY SIDE PANEL!

GOD**** IT, YOU WERE RIGHT.

THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM.

HE'S TURNING RIGHT!

GET OUT OF THE WAY!

THIS WAS A NEW CAR, RIGGS.

WELL, IT STILL IS.

ON THREE.

ONE...

...TWO... THREE!

S***!

YOU FORGOT TO TURN YOUR INDICATOR ON.

WHERE THE HELL IS HE? THIS GUY'S MANDRAKE!

WHERE WERE YOU, MAN?! DAMN IT!

ME?! WHERE DID HE GO?!

- HE'S F***ING GONE! - I CAN SEE THAT!

- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COME ON "THREE". - I THOUGHT YOU MEANT, "THREE" THEN GO!

NO! WE ALWAYS GO ON "THREE"!

SOMETIMES WE GO, "ONE, TWO, THREE," THEN GO!

GO CHECK BACK THERE!

IF YOU SEE ANYBODY RUNNING OUT, JUST PUMP THE S*** OUT OF THEM.

WHAT WAS THAT?

- HE CRAWLED INTO THE TRUNK. - I GOT YOU COVERED.

HOLY CHRIST!

THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

IT'S GOLD!

GOLD!

KRUGERRANDS.

IT'S ILLEGAL. YOU CAN'T IMPORT THEM INTO THE COUNTRY.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

THE DAMAGE YOU CAUSED IS COMING OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET.

- PAY IT IN KRUGERRANDS. - DON'T MAKE JOKES, MAKE ARRESTS.

I WANT AN EXPLANATION.

- THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND. - YOU SAID THIS WAS A ROUTINE BUST.

YOU DIDN'T MENTION HELICOPTERS, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, KRUGERRANDS...

THIS WAS BIGGER THAN WE THOUGHT.

TALK TO YOU LATER.

I WORKED PSYCHO WARD. YOU'LL NEVER GET OUT.

ONE MINUTE, FIFTEEN SECONDS.

SHAPIRO, SCRATCH MY NOSE.

HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON? IS THIS KINDERGARTEN OR A POLICE STATION?

GET SOME WORK DONE.

HOUDINI JR. BETS HE CAN FREE HIMSELF IN 5 MINUTES.

I WILL TOO.

DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME, KIDS.

IT'S OVER NOW. PUT YOUR MONEY ON THE DESK AND GET BACK TO WORK.

SUCKERS.

HOW THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT?

I DISLOCATED MY SHOULDER ONCE. NOW I CAN DO IT WHENEVER I WANT.

DOESN'T IT HURT?

YEAH, IT DOES.

BUT NOT AS MUCH AS... WHEN I PUT IT BACK IN.

IF IT ISN'T MRS. SIGMUND FRAUD.

MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN, SERGEANT.

WE SHOULD KEEP THIS ON A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL.

WHY THE HELL DO YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF?

WHO ELSE COULD I DO IT TO? NONE OF THEM WILL LET ME.

AND I NEED THE MONEY.

COUGH UP!

IT'S NOT ALL HERE YET. I WANT IT ALL.

WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF TO THIS STUFF! IT'S EVIDENCE. IT'S A KRUGERRAND.

- IT'S MINE. I WON IT. - IT'S NOT YOURS.

YOU WANT TO GET BUSTED?

WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

NOT TONIGHT.

- RIANNE'S COMMERCIAL IS ON. - SHE'S IN A COMMERCIAL?

NOT SO LOUD!

WHAT'S WRONG? I'D BE PROUD IF I WAS YOU.

I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET. WHAT IF SHE STINKS?

YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING. SHE'LL BE GREAT.

LISTEN UP!

TONIGHT AT... WHAT TIME?

COME ON!

WHAT TIME?

EIGHT.

EIGHT O'CLOCK, ON... CHANNEL?

EIGHT. THE SERGEANT'S DAUGHTER, RIANNE. HERE'S A PICTURE OF HER.

SHE'S GOING TO MAKE HER TELEVISION DEBUT IN A COMMERCIAL.

WITH THIS CROWD, BABY, YOU'D BETTER NOT STINK.

WHAT HAPPENED? THIS IS A NEW CAR. MOM'S GOING TO BE UPSET!

- IT'S STILL NEW. - NO, IT'S NOT, IT'S WRECKED.

I DON'T WANT YOUR MOTHER TO KNOW.

DO YOUR HOMEWORK TOO.

- HEY! I HAVEN'T READ THESE. - RIANNE PUT THEM THERE.

WHY DON'T YOU LOOK OUT FOR ME?

HEY, RICKY! I WANT TO USE MY DRIVEWAY ONCE IN A WHILE.

NICE OXYGEN TENT.

- DO I LOOK LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON? - NO, BUT YOU'RE BAD.

THIS IS A TWO-CAR GARAGE, AND THIS IS MY HOBBY ROOM UPSTAIRS.

I RETIRE WHEN I'M 52, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS KICK IN WHEN I'M 55.

YOU'RE NOT RETIRING, ARE YOU?

- I'VE THOUGHT OF IT, SINCE I MET YOU. - THANK YOU.

THIS IS A NICE HOBBY ROOM. ALL YOU NEED NOW IS A HOBBY.

JESUS!

WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

I'M SORRY. THAT'S VERY UNCOOL.

YOU'RE SORRY? CHECK MY SHORTS!

- DON'T YOU USE HAMMERS ANYMORE? - WHAT'S A HAMMER?

EASY. IT'S NO SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

GIVE IT BACK.

A MAN'S NOT EVEN SAFE IN HIS OWN HOME.

THEN STAY THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

YOU GOT ANY TRAFFIC WARRANTS?

CAN YOU FIX THEM?

ALMOST TIME. ARE WE TAPING THIS?

YES, SO WE CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

TAKE THE STAIRS.

NICK, GET YOUR FEET OFF THE TABLE. YOU TOO, MARTIN.

- THE COLOR'S NO GOOD. - IT'S FINE. YOU'LL MESS IT UP.

I WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD.

UNPLUG IT.

THAT'S YOUR SISTER!

PICTURE'S PERFECT.

YEAH?

DO I KNOW YOU?

YES, SIR.

WE HAD A LONG TALK ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

ABOUT WHAT?

YOUR NEW HOBBY ROOM.

THIS IS GEORGE.

DID YOU SENSE THAT I LIKED YOU?

YES, SIR.

SIT DOWN AND BE QUIET.

- WHAT ARE YOU EATING? - MY TUNA FISH SANDWICH.

TUNA?

YOU CAN'T EAT TUNA!

DAD KILLED FLIPPER.

WE'RE BOYCOTTING TUNA...

...BECAUSE THEY KILL THE DOLPHINS THAT GET CAUGHT IN THE NETS.

HAVE HAM.

EAT MISS PIGGY.

- I'M SORRY! - IT'S ONLY MY EYE.

OH, MY GOD! IT'S COMING ON!

MY BABY!

DON'T SHE LOOK GORGEOUS, MARTIN?

WHEN THE TIME HAS COME...

...AND THE MOMENT IS RIGHT...

...REMEMBER...

...USE RAMSES' EXTRA CONDOMS.

- WE DO! - RAMSES' EXTRA.

BECAUSE CARING MEANS ALL THE PROTECTION YOU CAN GET.

TAKE THE KIDS UPSTAIRS.

WE LEARN THIS IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT.

IN HUMAN WHAT?! HUMAN DEVELOPMENT WHAT?!

CHILL OUT, DADDY.

UPSTAIRS!

NICK, UPSTAIRS.

YOU KNOW HOW YOUR FATHER IS.

- I LOOKED FAT. - I LIKED YOU.

HOME. OUT!

I GOT A GUN.

WHAT? SHE LOOKED BEAUTIFUL.

I LIKED IT. SHE MADE ME WANT TO BUY RUBBERS RIGHT NOW.

I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. RIANNE, THAT WAS...

- I THOUGHT YOU WERE TERRIFIC. - REALLY?

I THINK SHE'S GOT A HELL OF A FUTURE.

GEORGE IS AFRAID. HE'S GOING HOME.

STICK AROUND.

HE HAS A GUN.

IT'S AN OLD GUN AND HE'S NOT A VERY GOOD SHOT.

THAT'S GOOD. I'M GOING ANYWAY. GOOD NIGHT.

- I'LL BUY YOU A BEER. - YOU LET HIM BUY IT.

YOU'RE UNDER 21. BE BACK BY MIDNIGHT.

WAIT AND SEE. COPS NEVER LET UP.

I'LL HAVE RUBBERS ON MY DESK, RUBBERS IN THE MAIL, IN THE COFFEE...

IF YOU'D ONLY KEPT YOUR MOUTH SHUT! I'M GOING FOR A WALK.

GIVE THE BOYS SOME CREDIT. IN ONE EAR, OUT THE RUBBER.

HOW GOES IT WITH YOU, HANS?

OKAY. YOU, PIETER?

THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH OF THAT. COME ON OVER HERE, HANS.

MIND THE PLASTIC. I'M HAVING PAINTING DONE.

THE IMPORTANT THING IS...

...ARE YOU OKAY?

NO BONES BROKEN?

I'M FINE, THANKS.

JUST BUMPS AND BRUISES, EH?

YEAH, THAT'S ALL.

GOOD, GOOD.

HOWEVER, WE LOST OVER $1 MILLION IN KRUGERRAND.

I KNOW. I'M SORRY, MR. RUDD.

IT HAPPENS.

IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

SOMETIMES THINGS DO NOT GO AS PLANNED.

AS YOU SAY, THEY JUST HAPPEN, EH, PIETER?

YOU GIVE A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO THE WORD, "DROP CLOTH. "

CERTAIN POLICEMEN HAVE BECOME AN INTOLERABLE NUISANCE.

THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY ON TO US AGAIN. HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO HANDLE IT?

WARN THEM OFF.

IT'S MY EXPERIENCE...

...THAT A SCARED COP IS MORE USEFUL THAN A DEAD ONE.

A WARNING?

IS THAT NOT A BIT TAME?

DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DO IT.

THEN YOU BETTER LOOK AT THIS.

THIS IS THE POLICEMAN IN CHARGE.

A KAFFIR.

LOVELY.

REMEMBER TO TAKE THESE IN ORDER.

THERE'S A PACKET FOR EACH DAY OF THE WEEK.

THIS YOURS?

I FOUND IT IN THE WASH.

I KEEP LOSING THIS.

SOMETHING'S WRONG.

NO, NOT REALLY. IT'S JUST A GOD**** PEN.

WHAT ABOUT THE PEN?

IT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING.

OF WHAT?

IT REMINDS ME OF...

...THE NIGHT VICKI WAS KILLED.

I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUSH.

THAT'S OKAY. WE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS.

I WAS TO MEET HER FOR DINNER. ONE OF THOSE ROMANTIC DINNERS FOR TWO.

I HAD SO MUCH WORK.

AND I FORGOT ABOUT IT.

SHE WAITED AT THE RESTAURANT FOR AN HOUR BEFORE SHE DROVE HOME.

IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN I GOT HOME TO A RINGING PHONE. I ANSWERED IT.

THEY SAID SHE WAS KILLED IN A CAR CRASH.

IF I'D BEEN DRIVING, WE'D HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT.

I REMEMBER FALLING DOWN ON MY KNEES AND SHAKING ALL OVER.

I REMEMBER THINKING, "I'M LOSING IT. "

THERE I WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR...

...AND I'M SEEING UNDER THE COUCH, AND I SEE THIS GOLD PEN.

JUST LYING THERE. I'D BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR TWO MONTHS. THERE IT IS.

SHE WASN'T A GREAT HOUSEKEEPER.

THIS VOICE GOES OFF IN MY HEAD, LIKE A DRILL INSTRUCTOR.

IT SAID, "GET UP! NOW!"

I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT, BUT I GOT UP. MUSCLES WERE STILL WORKING.

THEN I DROVE TO THE HOSPITAL...

...IDENTIFIED HER, SIGNED HER OUT WITH MY GOLD PEN.

TRISH FOUND A GOLD PEN IN THE LAUNDRY.

LOOK AROUND YOU, SAM.

ONE DAY, SAM...

...THIS'LL ALL BE YOURS.

FIND A NICE B***H, RAISE A COUPLE OF PUPS.

A MAN COULD BE HAPPY HERE.

ANYBODY TELL YOU IF YOU SIT ON COLD ROCKS TOO LONG, YOU GET PILES?

LET'S GO WATCH TV.

KAFFIRS!

WONDERING ABOUT YOUR KIDS?

ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE TO THEM?

IF I WAS YOU, I'D BE GOING NUTS NOW.

I'D BE GOING F***ING BANANAS.

WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE'VE DONE?

SHALL I TELL YOU?

JUST LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN WILD.

THIS HAS JUST BEEN A WARNING.

AFTER THIS, IT GETS BLOODY. TELL YOUR PEOPLE TO BACK OFF.

DON'T BE A SMART KAFFIR.

MAYBE WE LET YOU LIVE, HUH?

- YOU DIDN'T SEE A FACE? - NOT ONE. THEY HAD ON HOODS.

WHAT ABOUT A VOICE?

THAT CRAZY MOTHERF***ER WHO DID TALK HAD A STRANGE ACCENT.

NOT GERMAN, NOT ENGLISH. KIND OF GUTTURAL. REALLY S****Y ACCENT.

WAIT. ANYTHING LIKE WHAT WE CHASED THE OTHER NIGHT?

YEAH, KIND OF LIKE THAT.

TRISH AND THE KIDS?

THEY'RE AT HER SISTER'S HOUSE IN BELLFLOWER.

LISTEN UP! YOU HEARD WHAT HAPPENED TO ROG LAST NIGHT?

FORENSICS GET BACK WITH ANYTHING?

NOT YET. THEY'LL KEEP US POSTED.

WE GOT TO WATCH EACH OTHER'S BACKS AND FRONTS.

YOU CAN ALL WATCH MY BACK IN POKER TOMORROW. YOU IN?

- IF WE CATCH THESE ASSHOLES. - COUNT ME IN.

I GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOU.

LEO GETZ HAS BEEN PLACED IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY.

YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BABY-SIT UNTIL WASHINGTON SENDS THE FEDS.

- HOW LONG? - UNTIL THE RED TAPE IS PROCESSED.

COUPLE, THREE DAYS.

GETZ IS GOING TO TESTIFY BEFORE A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY.

DRUGS, LAUNDERED MONEY, ETC.

I'LL BE THERE IN 10 MINUTES.

THIS IS NOT A S*** ASSIGNMENT.

- YES, IT IS. - NO, IT ISN'T.

IT ISN'T.

IT IS.

SHUT UP, BOTH OF YOU.

I'VE GUARANTEED HIS SAFETY.

WHY US?

YOU TWO ARE THE MOST QUALIFIED. AND...

...AFTER LAST NIGHT, YOU COULD USE THE BREAK.

I CAN HANDLE LAST NIGHT.

WHAT DO WE DO WITH HIM?

TAKE HIM TO DISNEYLAND.

THIS STINKS. THIS STINKS.

I DON'T GIVE A F***! I DON'T HAVE AN ULCER BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN TO SAY THAT.

HERE'S WHERE HE'S STAYING.

A NICE HOTEL. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS PAYING. ENJOY YOURSELVES.

ONE MORE THING.

KNOW WHAT THAT SAYS?

YEAH. SAME THING AS THAT, BUT I DON'T GIVE A F***.

YOU'RE LUCKY. I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT.

WHAT ROOM IS THAT FOR?

612.

THIS IS IT. 612.

POLICE.

HOW DO I KNOW THAT?

AFTER I SHOOT YOU, YOU CAN EXAMINE THE BULLET. OPEN UP.

DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE A BADGE?

- WHERE'S YOUR BADGE? - SHUT UP.

I GET IT. BAD COP, GOOD COP.

SHUT UP.

BAD COP, BAD COP. I KNOW THE ROUTINES.

- ARE YOU LEO GETZ? - THAT'S ME, LEO GETZ.

WHATEVER YOU NEED, LEO GETS. GET IT?

I USE THAT TO BREAK THE ICE WHEN I MEET PEOPLE.

I'M SGT. MURTAUGH, THIS IS SGT. RIGGS.

NICE TO MEET YOU. SO WHAT DO I CALL YOU GUYS?

SGT. MURTAUGH AND SGT. RIGGS.

WE'RE GOING TO BE YOUR SHADOW.

THAT'S FINE. HEY, AN OLD-FASHIONED...

OKAY. I JUST AIN'T SEEN ONE IN A LONG TIME.

I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE USED THEM ANYMORE.

I BET THE KID'S GOT AN AUTOMATIC. HAVE YOU?

YEP, A BERETTA.

YOU SURE YOU GUYS ARE COPS?

BETTER WATCH HOW YOU TREAT ME. I'M A STATE WITNESS.

STAR WITNESS.

WE'LL TAKE THAT ROOM.

I ALREADY HAVE MY STUFF IN THIS ROOM.

IT'S YOURS, OKAY? I'LL MOVE IT IN THE SMALL ROOM.

I'M THE SMALLEST GUY HERE. I'LL TAKE THE SMALL ROOM.

HEY, LOOSEN UP, GUYS! WE'RE GOING TO BE TOGETHER A LONG TIME.

I'LL GET IT.

IT'S ONLY ROOM SERVICE.

YOU HUNGRY? I'LL CALL FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT.

SEE THIS SILK ROBE? FREE.

- IT'S NOT FREE. - YES, IT IS.

- IT'S TAXPAYERS' MONEY. - SAME THING.

MORNING, GENTLEMEN.

HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

THAT'S MY FOOD. YOU GUYS DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING. BRING IT HERE.

IT'S MINE.

YOU COULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING.

COME ON.

BOY, HEY, YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT.

HEY, I DIDN'T ORDER A HAMBURGER, I ORDERED EGGS.

MARTIN, NOT THE WINDOW! NO!

[ GLASS BREAKS ]

[ ALL SCREAMS ]

S***!

[ SPLASHING ]

[ GUESTS SCREAMS ]

[ WOMAN SCREAMS ]

[ COUGHS ]

[ HITTING ]

SON OF A BITCH! WHERE IS IT?

SOMEBODY STOP THAT GUY! STOP HIM!

DON'T LEAVE ME! I CAN'T SWIM!

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME!

OKAY, OKAY.

COME ON WE'RE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE POOL.

NOW GET THE FUCK OFF MY BACK, OKAY?

CLEAR! MOVE IT! GET BACK! POLICE!

YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?

YEAH, I’M OK. WHERE WERE YOU, MAN? MY PARTNER. WHAT? WHY DIDN'T YOU FOLLOW ME DOWN?

- YEAH, WHY DIDN'T YOU FOLLOW IT DOWN? - SHUT UP, I WAS 7 FLOORS UP!

- HE HIT ME. - GOOD!

THIS GUY TOOK A BIG CHANCE TO POP ALL OF US. WHAT'D YOU WITNESS, A MURDER OR SOMETHING OR WHAT WAS IT?

NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT. HONEST.

ALL I DID WAS LAUNDER A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN DRUG MONEY.

HALF A BILLION DOLLARS?!

MORE OR LESS. WHO CAN COUNT THAT MUCH MONEY?

COULD I HAVE SOME COTTON BALLS FOR MY NOSE?

COULD YOU SHUT THE F*** UP?

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

SHUT UP!

MR. GETZ GOT AWAY. OUR BEST OPPORTUNITY AND HE GETS AWAY.

HE SLIPS THROUGH OUR FINGERS AND INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLICE.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

CHECKING TO SEE IF I WAS STANDING ON PLASTIC.

OKAY, I GOT IT.

I'M WHO I AM. YOU'RE A DRUG DEALER. I WORK IN A BANK.

YOU HAVE MONEY TO LAUNDER. WHAT DO YOU DO?

BRING IT TO YOU.

- HE DOES. - I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY ME?

WHO AM I?

YOU'RE A COURIER. YOU WORK FOR HIM.

I'M THE DRUG DEALER.

DON'T YOU HAVE PLATES? WHAT IS THIS?

I DEPOSIT THE CASH INTO THE ACCOUNT OF A DUMMY FINANCE COMPANY.

I ISSUE YOU A CASHIER'S CHECK...

...IN HIS NAME, MINUS A SMALL COMMISSION FOR MYSELF.

- THE OTHER END. - YOU LIKE BREATHING?

HOW MUCH?

2%.

NOT BAD, LEO. PRETTY PROSPEROUS.

YOU RETURN IT TO ME AS COLLATERAL ON A LOAN I MAKE TO YOU.

BUT YOU DON'T PAY BACK THE LOAN. YOU KEEP THE MONEY.

HOW'S THAT WORK?

THAT'S IT! DON'T YOU GET IT?

IT'S YOUR MONEY. YOU DON'T PAY IT BACK. AND IT'S CLEAN.

IT IS NOW LAUNDERED.

YOU COPS AREN'T TOO BRIGHT.

THIS IS THE BEST PART.

YOU TAKE A TAX DEDUCTION...

...ON INTEREST PAYMENTS YOU DON'T EVEN MAKE.

- AM I A GENIUS? - YOU'RE A SWINDLER.

CHEAT.

COME ON!

EVERYONE CHEATS. LOOK AT THE PENTAGON. SO YOU GOT IT?

SO HOW COME YOU TURNED YOURSELF IN, MR. BIG SHOT?

I WAS SCAMMING THOSE GUYS FOR MONTHS.

EVERY TRANSACTION, I KEPT A LITTLE.

YOU?

IT WAS EASY. CASH DEPOSITS...

...MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SMALL BILLS CHANGING HANDS.

WHO'S GOING TO MISS $10,000 HERE, $20,000 THERE?

DRUG DEALERS.

THAT'S RIGHT. THEY DID.

THAT'S WHY I'M LIVING OUT OF A SUITCASE NOW.

YOU CAN GIVE THAT TO NICK.

BUT IT'S SOFTER. I PUT A FABRIC SOFTENER IN THERE.

IT'S SMALL, LEROY.

IT'S LEO, NOT LEROY. I'LL BUY YOU ANOTHER SHIRT.

JUST GIVE ME THE NAMES OF THOSE DRUG DEALERS.

I DON'T KNOW ANY.

I JUST DEALT WITH THE COURIERS.

WHERE DOES TRISH KEEP MY LAUNDRY?

BEHIND THE MACHINE.

YOU NEVER MET ANYONE EXCEPT COURIERS?

NO NAMES.

WAIT A MINUTE, COME TO THINK OF IT! OKAY, LISTEN.

THEY TOOK ME UP IN THE HILLS TO A HOUSE ON STILTS.

AND I HAD A JOB INTERVIEW WITH A GUY...

...AND HIS NAME WAS...

HAYNES! HANS!

- TAKE US THERE. - WE HAVE TO SIT ON THIS GUY.

IT WON'T HURT TO LOOK.

I KNOW THE ADDRESS.

LET'S GO.

WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS!

COME ON, DON'T BE A KILLJOY!

WE'RE BACK! YOU'RE BLACK, I'M MAD.

THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT!

IF WE'RE GOING, SHOULDN'T I HAVE A GUN?

IS MY NOSE STILL BLEEDING? IT'S REALLY SORE.

SORRY ABOUT THAT.

IT SHOULD BE COMING UP SOON.

- 9856. - THAT'S IT.

- THAT'S ANOTHER POSSIBILITY. - THIS IS THE NINTH POSSIBILITY, LEO.

THAT'S IT. NINE. MY LUCKY NUMBER. NINE.

STAY IN THE CAR.

- CAN'T I COME? - STAY.

NICE CAR.

- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - HOOKING IT UP.

YOU'RE NOT BEING CAREFUL!

I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. IT'S A CAR...

...NOT A BABY CARRIAGE.

YOU'RE CHIPPING THE PAINT.

- YOU SMELL WHAT I SMELL? - I SMELL IT.

A RAT?

A REAL STINKY ONE.

WHERE YOU GOING?

I'M A PEEPING TOM. IT GOES WITH THE BADGE. IT'S FUN SOMETIMES.

BINGO!

LARS, LOOK!

WHAT THE F***?!

WHERE'S THE POOL?

NO POOL.

- OF COURSE THERE IS. - THIS HOUSE IS BUILT ON STILTS.

I'M SURE THERE'S A POOL.

CUFF YOURSELVES.

MOVE THAT TRUCK!

YOUR KEYS!

YOU ALL RIGHT?

WHERE YOU GOING?

THAT WAS THE WAITER FROM THE HOTEL.

WAIT FOR ME!

GET THE F*** OUT OF HERE!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU CAN'T TAKE MY TRUCK!

SERGEANT, IT'S THE GUY FROM THE HOTEL!

WHERE DID HE GO?

RIGGS IS HANGING ON THE TRUCK!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF THE CAR? GET IN THE CAR!

GET BACK! IT'S POLICE BUSINESS!

IT'S A HIGH-SPEED CHASE! GET OUT OF THE WAY!

I LOVE IT! WE GOT TO CATCH HIM!

HELLO, ASSHOLE.

GIVE ME THAT!

THERE THEY ARE! HURRY UP!

CAN'T YOU GO FASTER?!

WILL YOU SHUT THE F*** UP?

WIPE OUT. IT'S UNDER CONTROL.

I TOLD YOU TO LOOK OUT!

- YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR THIS. - SHUT UP! YAK-YAK-YAK.

AND STAY!

WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, A DOG?

HANDS BEHIND YOUR NECK!

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE? WE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

WHAT IS GOING ON?

FREEZE!

GET DOWN HERE!

COME ON, IT'S BEEN A BAD DAY.

SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.

TAKE IT EASY, OFFICER. I'M NOT ARMED.

I WON'T RESIST.

PUT DOWN YOUR GUNS, GENTLEMEN. IT'S ALL RIGHT. DO AS I SAY!

HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.

BEHIND YOUR HEAD!

YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

WE'RE PROFESSIONAL POLICE OFFICERS. WE DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

MY NAME IS ARJEN RUDD.

I'M MINISTER OF DIPLOMATIC AFFAIRS FOR THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSULATE.

SOUTH AFRICA. HOME OF THE KRUGERRAND.

AMONG OTHER THINGS.

THESE MEN ALSO WORK FOR THE CONSULATE.

WE HAVE DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIALS...

KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT OF THERE.

EVERYBODY, TAKE IT EASY. ESPECIALLY YOU, RIGGS.

RIGGS?

YOU'RE MARTIN RIGGS?

FROM CHICAGO. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? WHAT'S HIS NAME?

PIETER VON... VOR...

I'LL JUST CALL YOU ADOLF.

ARE YOU ARJEN RUDD? ARYAN...? THAT'S YOU.

IT'S OFFICIAL.

THEY ARE OFFICIAL.

UNDER THE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ACT...

...NO DIPLOMATIC AGENT MAY BE DETAINED OR ARRESTED...

...ONCE HIS IDENTITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.

WE HAVE A SERIOUS DIPLOMATIC SITUATION HERE...

...WHICH I WILL TAKE UP WITH YOUR STATE DEPARTMENT TOMORROW.

I'M QUAKING IN MY BOOTS, BUT I'LL STILL BRING YOU DOWN.

MY DEAR OFFICER...

...YOU COULD NOT EVEN GIVE ME A PARKING TICKET.

WHO IS THE DICKHEAD NOW, HUH?

THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT OWNS THIS HOUSE. THIS IS SOUTH AFRICAN SOIL.

NOW GET OUT OF HERE.

ALL OF YOU.

DON'T DO IT.

DON'T DO IT OR I'LL MAKE YOU EAT THIS F***ING THING.

KAFFIR.

COULD YOU STEP OUT OF THE CAR, PLEASE?

PUT THEM AWAY. I'M SORRY.

SORRY. ARE YOU OKAY?

DON'T OPEN THAT.

THAT IS A DIPLOMATIC POUCH...

...PROTECTED UNDER ARTICLE 27 OF THE VIENNA CONVENTION.

IS HE SERIOUS WITH THIS STUFF?

THESE ARE POLICE OFFICERS, MISS VAN DEN HAAS. THEY WERE JUST LEAVING.

SHE IS A CONSULATE SECRETARY.

GIVE HER BACK THE BRIEFCASE.

GIVE IT TO HER.

I'M SORRY, MISS CONSULATE SECRETARY.

DON'T TALK TO THEM! COME HERE.

HE'S A NICE GUY. WHAT'S HE PAYING YOU AN HOUR?

WANT TO INCREASE YOUR PAY? BETTER HOURS?

I'D START GETTING USED TO THAT SORT OF VIEW.

IT'S THE TRIANGLE TRADE AGAIN.

DON'T YOU KNOW AMERICAN HISTORY? MOLASSES TO RUM TO SLAVES.

NOW DRUGS TO DOLLARS TO KRUGERRANDS.

I GOT A DEAD GUY WITH A SURFBOARD WHERE HIS FACE USED TO BE...

...AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT BREATHING DOWN OUR THROATS.

I'LL HAVE TO MAKE A FORMAL APOLOGY TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSULATE.

APOLOGIZE? HE'S A SACK OF S***! HE'S A CROOK.

IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE'S A DIPLOMAT.

HE HAS IMMUNITY. WE CAN'T TOUCH HIM, ARREST HIM, PROSECUTE HIM.

- DOES THAT SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU? - YES, SIR.

- WHO THE HELL IS THIS GUY? - LEO GETZ. NICE TO MEET YOU.

YOU TOOK A CIVILIAN ON A BUST. ONE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING!

HE'S ALIVE, ISN'T HE?

I SIGNED A WAIVER. BESIDES, I USUALLY WAIT IN THE CAR.

USUALLY?

THEY'RE VERY ADAMANT ABOUT THAT.

- I DON'T GIVE A F***. - THEY'RE GOOD COPS!

THEY'RE THE BEST. ONE TIME, A GUY WAS WAIVING A GUN...!

WHAT DID HE SAY?

WHAT DID HE SAY?

- "I DON'T GIVE A F***. " - WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

IT'S HIS MANTRA. WHY IS EVERYONE PARKED ON MY DESK? UP!

IT'S A RUBBER PLANT!

IT LOOKS TO BE ABOUT A WEEK'S SUPPLY.

GO SPIT.

I FORGOT. YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR THAT S***.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU CAN EXCHANGE IT.

ONE MOMENT, MISS VAN DEN HAAS.

I HOPE YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAPPENED HERE TODAY.

I'D RATHER NOT JUMP TO ANY WRONG CONCLUSIONS.

WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME?

THE POLICIES OF OUR GOVERNMENT ARE NOT POPULAR HERE IN AMERICA.

THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HERE IS OVERRUN WITH BLACKS.

THEY HAVE BADGES AND GUNS AND THEY HATE US.

OUR CONSULATE, ITS STAFF...

...AND PARTICULARLY MYSELF WILL ALWAYS BE TARGETS FOR THEIR HARASSMENT.

THINGS ARE GETTING OUT OF HAND.

THERE ARE TOO MANY LOSSES. WE'LL MOVE THE CASH IN ONE LARGE SHIPMENT.

WE'LL NEED MORE THAN A SUITCASE.

I'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT. YOU WORRY ABOUT THE POLICE.

YOUR WARNING DID NOT WORK.

- LET'S GO, LEO! - I'M COMING.

COME ON! MOVE!

OKAY! HEY, THEY'RE COPS, OKAY?

I'VE GOT TO EAT, TOO.

GIVE ME THE FOOD.

WHO ORDERED THE SUPER COMBO?

I GET A STEAK SANDWICH.

WHO GETS LEO?

YOU GOT A BIG EMPTY HOUSE. I GOT A TRAILER. WHAT WILL I DO WITH HIM?

MY PLACE IS TOO SMALL. YOU TAKE HIM.

I HAD HIM LAST NIGHT.

EXCUSE ME, FELLOWS.

THIS IS TUNA. I HATE TUNA.

I REFUSE TO GET STUCK WITH TUNA.

- DON'T EAT THE TUNA. - I JUST SAID THAT!

I'M NOT EATING TUNA. LET'S GO BACK.

WE'RE NOT GOING BACK! SHUT UP!

SURE, DON'T GO BACK. OKAY, DON'T GO BACK!

LET ME GIVE YOU A FRIENDLY PIECE OF ADVICE.

NEVER GO THROUGH THE DRIVE-THROUGH. ALWAYS WALK UP TO THE COUNTER.

LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

THEY F*** YOU AT THE DRIVE-THROUGH!

THEY KNOW YOU'LL BE MILES AWAY BEFORE YOU FIND OUT YOU GOT F***ED.

YOU WON'T TURN AROUND AND COME BACK.

SO WHO GETS F***ED? LEO GETZ.

I'M NOT EATING THIS TUNA!

SHUT UP!

GET RID OF THAT MAN.

YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE THE PREMISES RIGHT NOW.

THE MORNING FAXES.

WHAT'S THE MATTER? HE KICK YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE?

I WANT YOU TO BITE LEO FOR ME.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I'M CLEANING UP THIS PIGSTY.

I LIKE THIS PIGSTY.

WHEN DID YOU LAST DO THE REFRIGERATOR? OR THE PAN UNDER IT?

THERE'S A PAN UNDER THERE?

WHERE'S MY PHONE?

WHERE'S MY TV? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

EVERYTHING IS OUTSIDE.

JUST STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

- GET THE DOG OUT OF HERE! - YOU GO BEFORE THE MUTT.

OUT, OUT! OH, MAN.

IT'S COLLINS.

HAS MURTAUGH CHECKED IN WITH YOU?

NO. WHY?

I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM. HE DOESN'T ANSWER HIS PHONE.

I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

STAY IN THE CAR.

I'M UPSTAIRS!

SHOULD I CALL 999, OFFICER IN DISTRESS?

I'LL COVER THE BACK!

- WHERE ARE YOU? - I'M UP HERE.

IN HERE.

GOOD MORNING.

FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS...

...I GET THE BATHROOM TO MYSELF.

NO KIDS BANGING ON THE DOOR. NO WIFE ASKING ME TO HURRY UP.

JUST ME AND MY NEW SALTWATER SPORTSMAN MAGAZINE!

THE ONE WITH THE ARTICLE ON DEEP-SEA FISHING?

SO I'M READING ABOUT MARLIN FISHING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO...

...WHEN I GLANCED OVER.

OH, JESUS.

IS THAT ALL?

YOU SCARED THE S*** OUT OF ME.

SCARED THE S*** OUT OF YOU?

HOW LONG YOU BEEN HERE?

I'VE BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT.

MY LEGS ARE SO NUMB I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN...

DON'T MOVE.

I CAN'T.

JUST STAY THAT WAY. DO YOU MIND?

IT'S A DIRTY JOB, BUT SOMEONE'S GOT TO DO IT.

TELL ME I'M NOT F***ED.

HE'S F***ED.

OKAY, BUT I'D BE LYING.

YOU'LL BE OKAY IF YOU DON'T STAND UP.

THAT'S A RELIEF.

- I HAVE TO GET HELP. - NO WAY!

WHY?

I'M ON THE TOILET. GIVE ME A BREAK.

THIS IS SERIOUS. I GOT TO GET THE BOMB SQUAD HERE.

BOMB SQUAD?

OKAY, CALL THEM IN.

DON'T USE THE OPEN FREQUENCY.

LET'S TRY TO KEEP THIS QUIET, OKAY?

SURE. TRUST ME.

AN ESCORT IS REALLY NOT NECESSARY.

I KNOW YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST, BUT IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT.

I HAVE HELPED POLICEMEN THROUGH VERY TRAUMATIC MOMENTS.

THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS ROOM THAT I CANNOT HANDLE.

I WAS WRONG.

EXCUSE ME.

I SHOULD'VE KNOWN, WHERE THERE'S ONE, THERE'S THE OTHER.

YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST? I HAVE THESE DREAMS.

IT'S READY TO COME OUT.

I GOT TO LIVE IN THIS HOUSE!

CLEAR THIS ROOM.

COME ON, RIGGS.

YOU, TOO, RIGGS.

NO.

RIGGS, OUT.

ALL RIGHT.

DIVE INTO THE TUB.

THEN PULL THE BOMB BLANKET OVER YOUR HEAD.

THIS CAST IRON TUB WILL WITHSTAND A HELL OF A BLAST.

I CAN'T.

HE CAN'T. HE'S BEEN ON THERE FOR 18 HOURS.

HE CAN'T EVEN WALK.

I'M GONNA HAVE TO HELP HIM.

ALL RIGHT, YOU BETTER WEAR THIS.

THE NITROGEN?

ALMOST THERE.

HE'S SPRAYING THIS THING WITH LIQUID NITROGEN...

...TO GIVE YOU 1 OR 2 SECONDS BEFORE DETONATION.

- GOT THAT? - 2 SECONDS. THANKS A LOT.

LIGHTS OUT.

GET HIM UP AND OUT.

GOOD LUCK.

YOU GOT A PIECE?

- YEAH, A SMITH AND WESSON. - TRY THIS ONE.

SAFETY'S ON. I'LL COLLECT IT LATER.

GOOD LUCK.

ALONE AT LAST.

WHY DIDN'T THEY PLANT THE BOMB IN TRISH'S STOVE?

ALL THE NEEDLESS SUFFERING COULD HAVE ENDED THERE.

I'M GOING TO DIE ON A TOILET.

GUYS LIKE YOU DON'T DIE ON TOILETS.

AND I'M HERE AND I DON'T PLAN ON GOING NOW.

LET'S DO IT.

ON THREE. WAIT, LET ME GET INTO THE TUB.

I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU...

ON THREE, HUH? WHAT DO YOU SAY?

ONE...

...TWO...

WAIT.

DO WE DO IT ON THREE, OR...

...ONE, TWO, THREE...

- ... THEN DO IT? - IT'S YOUR ASS. IT'S UP TO YOU.

MY ASS, YEAH.

THREE.

WE GO ON THREE?

ONE, TWO AND THEN THREE!

ONE...

MARTIN?

I KNOW.

I MEAN IT, MAN.

I HEAR YOU.

WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIE, ALL RIGHT?

ON THREE.

GET OFF ME. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO SEE US LIKE THIS.

MR. JONES?

SIT DOWN.

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY?

I HAVE THIS PROBLEM, THIS VERY DELICATE MATTER.

MY FRIEND WANTS TO EMIGRATE TO SOUTH AFRICA.

OF COURSE, I CAN HELP HIM DO THAT.

I WANT YOU TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

TALK HIM OUT OF IT?

WHATEVER FOR?

THIS IS A BAD TIME FOR HIM TO GO, WITH ALL THE TROUBLE.

HAVE HIM COME BACK LATER IN THE WEEK AND WE'LL SIT DOWN...

HE'S HERE.

YEAH, HE'S HERE NOW. ALPHONSE?

THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE.

SAY, WHAT?

LISTEN TO YOUR FRIEND. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO GO TO SOUTH AFRICA.

WHY NOT?

BECAUSE YOU'RE BLACK.

YOU ARE.

HE IS.

OF COURSE I AM BLACK. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GO.

TO JOIN MY BROTHERS IN THE STRUGGLE...

...AGAINST THE RACIST...

...FASCIST...

...WHITE MINORITY REGIME!

FASCIST REGIME!

ONE MAN, ONE VOTE!

FREE SOUTH AFRICA, YOU SON-OF-A-B***H!

I'VE HEARD AS MUCH AS I WANT TO. YOU MUST LEAVE.

WHAT'S HAPPENING? DON'T TOUCH ME! BACK OFF!

CLOSE THE SECURITY GATE! QUICKLY!

END APARTHEID NOW!

YOU GOING TO ARREST ME IF I DON'T SHUT UP?

ONE MAN, ONE VOTE! FREE SOUTH AFRICA! GIVE ME THAT FLAG!

YOU CAN'T PUSH ME OUT!

YOU CALL THIS SECURITY?

MORE PEOPLE COME IN AND OUT OF HERE THAN GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

WAIT, GENTLEMEN!

DON'T BOTHER TO CALL THE POLICE. I'M HERE ALREADY.

I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

WELL, WELL.

THE MASTER RACE.

I HOPE YOU REALIZE THE TROUBLE YOU ARE IN RIGHT NOW.

AS USUAL, YOU PEOPLE HAVE EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN AND TURNED AROUND.

GENTLEMEN...

...SHOW OFFICER RIGGS INTO THE STREET.

FINGERS OFF.

HANDS OFF!

LET ME SEE THAT.

THAT'S A PIECE OF HARDWARE YOU GOT. WHERE DO YOU GET THAT STUFF?

I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. WHERE'S IT FROM, SOUTH AFRICA?

DON'T MOVE.

YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT ME? I GOT A BAD REPUTATION. SOMETIMES I GO NUTS.

DON'T MOVE.

I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU, ARJEN. OR IS IT ARYAN?

WHATEVER THE F*** YOUR NAME IS.

YOU FOLD UP YOUR TENTS...

...AND GET OUT OF MY COUNTRY...

...AND I WON'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU.

I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

'CAUSE IF YOU STICK AROUND HERE, I'M GONNA F*** YOUR ASS.

SEND YOU HOME WITH YOUR BALLS IN A SLING.

JUST GET OUT OF HERE...

...KAFFIR LOVER.

EENIE...

...MEENIE...

...MINEY...

HEY, MOE!

SORRY, ADOLF.

PICK THEM UP WITH YOUR HANDS.

BIG SMILE. BIG SMILE!

VORSTEDT, COME HERE.

VORSTEDT!

- HELLO, OFFICER...? - MARTIN RIGGS.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I'VE BEEN WITH YOUR BOSS... SHOOTING THE BREEZE.

SHOOTING HIS FISH.

THE GUY GOES, "BUT, BUT, BUT... YOU'RE BLACK!"

HE'S BLACK.

NO S***.

HE STARTED SOME S***!

YOU GET INTO RUDD'S OFFICE?

I GOT UP THERE.

ARYAN CRUD AND HIS BROWN SHIRTS TURNED UP, BUT I RIPPED THIS OFF A PAD.

"ALBA VARDEN, THURSDAY. " ALBA VARDEN?

ISN'T THAT HITLER'S GIRLFRIEND?

THAT'S EVA BRAUN.

HE HAS A DATE WITH HER THURSDAY.

HER NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

I DON'T KNOW HER. IT JUST SOUNDS FAMILIAR. ALBA VARDEN.

A DELI! LET'S EAT. I'M STARVING.

I'LL SPRING.

LET'S GO. SOUNDS GOOD.

- GET OUT THE OTHER SIDE, LEO. - IT'S OKAY!

NO CARS.

THAT POLICEMAN.

YOU SHOULD PICK FROM THE BOTTOM.

THEY PUT THE OLD STUFF ON TOP.

OFFICER RIGGS!

I FOLLOWED YOU FROM THE CONSULATE.

YOU FOLLOWED ME?

WELL, I NEEDED SOME PORK CHOPS AND A TOILET BRUSH, TOO.

I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE...

...FOR THE OTHER DAY, IF WE FRIGHTENED YOU.

I WAS A BIT STARTLED BY ALL THOSE GUNS.

I'M SORRY. AND I WANTED TO THANK YOU, TOO.

THANK ME FOR WHAT?

YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR BOSS VERY MUCH, DO YOU?

I DON'T LIKE MANY THINGS ABOUT MY BOSS AND MY COUNTRY.

BUT I LIKE MY JOB VERY MUCH.

IT KEEPS ME HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

YOU LIKE THIS TOWN?

THAT'S A NEW ONE.

- I FORGOT YOUR FIRST NAME. - IT'S RIKA.

RIKA VAN HAAGEN-DAZS.

- ICE CREAM? - NO, VAN DEN HAAS. IT'S DUTCH.

THAT'S REAL PRETTY.

YOU GOT A RABBIT AT HOME?

IT'S MINE.

SHOP ONE DAY AT A TIME?

GOOD POLICE WORK, OFFICER.

I GET PAID FOR THAT.

I DON'T SHOP FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK.

WHY NOT?

I NEVER KNOW WHAT I'LL BE HUNGRY FOR.

WAIT. HAVE DINNER WITH ME.

I GOT A NICE PLACE ON THE BEACH. A GOOD VIEW FROM EVERY WINDOW.

A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET. COME ON, BE ORIGINAL. EVERYONE ELSE SAYS NO.

COME TO MY PLACE. I'M A GOURMET COOK.

LET GO OF THE BASKET.

I'LL SCREAM.

I'LL EMBARRASS YOU IN PUBLIC. YOU'LL TURN RED LIKE THAT APPLE.

- COME ON WITH ME. - NO, NO, PLEASE.

LET GO OF MY BAG! LOOK WHAT SHE'S DOING! SOMEBODY CALL A COP!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

LET'S GO BEFORE SOMEONE CALLS A COP.

YOU ARE A COP.

YOU MUST BE AN HONEST COP.

IT AIN'T MUCH, BUT IT'S EVERYTHING I SAID. LOOK AT THE VIEW.

I DID EXAGGERATE ABOUT ONE THING, THOUGH.

I'M NOT EXACTLY A GOURMET COOK. I CAN ONLY MAKE CHILI.

- LIKE IT WITH CRUSHED OREOS? - OF COURSE.

A WOMAN AFTER MY OWN HEART.

WATCH YOUR STEP.

SAM WANTS IN.

HERE, SIT DOWN. OH, WAIT A MINUTE. A LITTLE FILTHY.

I HAVE NO WINE. HOW ABOUT A BEER?

THAT'S FINE.

SHE DRINKS BEER.

WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU GOT A DIRTY GLASS?

OH, IT'S THE WEDDING RING.

I USED TO BE MARRIED.

NOT ANY MORE?

NOT ANY MORE.

I'VE GOT SOMETHING ON THE STOVE.

RUDD'S HIDING BEHIND HIS DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIALS, ISN'T HE?

RUDD'S HIDING BEHIND HIS DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIALS.

HE'S NOT A VERY NICE GUY.

WHATEVER HE'S DOING...

...HE SHOULDN'T GET AWAY WITH IT.

HOW'S IT HANGING, WYLER?

- WHAT DO YOU WANT? - I HOPE BETTER THAN MURTAUGH.

EASY, EASY.

TELL ME SOMETHING. HAVE YOUR BRAINS EVER SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY?

WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT? I'M A COP!

NO, YOU WERE A COP.

HURRY UP, HONEY.

I'M GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE LAPS BEFORE I GO TO THE STATION.

SAM, TAKE A HIKE. NO STOOGES TONIGHT. GO ON.

GET THAT BEER IN HERE.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

CAVANAUGH, ARE YOU IN OR OUT?

I'M OUT.

PUT SOME MUSIC ON.

WHO'S NOT ACCOUNTED FOR?

RIGGS AND MURTAUGH.

MURTAUGH'S TAKING THE WITNESS TO A NEW LOCATION.

- AND RIGGS? - HASN'T CHECKED IN YET.

GET ON THE RADIO AND FIND THEM!

WE LOST WYLER, COLLINS, CAVANAUGH. HOW MANY DO WE HAVE TO LOSE?

LET'S WORRY ABOUT THE ONES THAT ARE ALIVE, ALL RIGHT? DO IT.

SORRY, CAPTAIN.

GET ME RIGGS.

I'LL GET THAT.

WRONG NUMBER.

THANKS TO YOU, I MISSED MY POKER GAME AND I WAS FEELING REAL LUCKY.

OKAY, SO WHAT I SEE ARE NICE, CONSERVATIVE TAX RETURNS.

EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK, BLACK AND WHITE.

SO YOU JUST NEED TO PLAY AROUND IN THE GRAY AREAS...

...IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME BUCKS.

ON YOUR SALARY, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO BUT YOU NEED DEDUCTIONS.

- MY BOAT. - YOU CAN'T DEDUCT IT.

NO, IT'S THE BILL OF SALE.

I KNOW, BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT.

THAT'S IT, MY BOAT! LET'S GO!

TO MY HOUSE.

BECAUSE OF MY BOAT.

LOOK AT THIS COMMERCIAL.

LOOK AT THE BODY ON THIS KID. SHE IS SO HOT.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I WANT TO LOOK AT THE GIRL! WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

I DIDN'T HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

SAY WHAT? SHE'S GREAT.

SHE MAKES ME WANT TO BUY RUBBERS.

TIME FOR THE SEVENTH INNING STRETCH.

THAT'S A BASEBALL EXPRESSION.

I KNOW.

BUT WE'RE ONLY UP TO THE FOURTH INNING.

BATTER UP.

STAY IN THE CAR.

I'LL ONLY BE A MINUTE, OKAY?

STAY IN THE CAR? IT'S COLD. YOU HAVE NO DOOR.

YOU'RE THE REASON THERE'S NO DOOR. TURN ON THE HEAT.

DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING. NOTHING. I MEAN NOTHING!

ALBA VARDEN. WHY DO I KNOW THE NAME?

IT'S HERE. IT'S GOT TO BE.

- ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER HOBBY. - YEAH, ANOTHER HOBBY. WHAT'S NEW?

THAT'S THE DAY ON MY BOAT.

IT'S NOT THERE. WHERE IS IT?

MY BIRTHDAY.

I'LL BE DAMNED.

ALBA VARDEN IS A SHIP, NOT A WOMAN.

LEO, I TOLD YOU TO STAY IN THE CAR!

S***!

NAILED THEM BOTH.

MY CAR!

LEO!

GET UP, GET DRESSED. GET DRESSED. COME ON.

- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. - JUST TRUST ME. I GOT A BAD FEELING.

GET IN THE TRUCK. THE KEYS ARE UNDER THE FRONT SEAT.

WHEN THEY STOP TO RELOAD, RUN FOR THE TRUCK!

- WHAT ABOUT YOU? - I'LL BE OKAY.

I'LL MEET YOU IN THE TRUCK. GO ON! STAY OUT OF THE LIGHT!

THE MASTER RACE.

YOU S***! WHO WERE THOSE PEOPLE?

YOU TELL ME. WAS IT YOUR HUSBAND? WHAT ARE YOU DOING SATURDAY?

IT'S SAM!

HEAD DOWN!

COME ON, SAM!

COME ON, SAM.

SHAKE A LEG.

YOU MADE IT.

HAS HE GOT ANY HOLES IN HIM?

OH, YOU CLEVER DOG.

I PROMISED TO HAVE YOU HOME BY 11.

THIS IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE FIRST DATE I'VE EVER BEEN ON.

WAIT UNTIL THE SECOND ONE.

- NO MORE HELICOPTERS, PLEASE. - OKAY, I PROMISE.

THIS IS A VERY NICE BUILDING.

ANY VACANCIES? I'M BETWEEN HOMES.

YOU CAN STAY RIGHT HERE.

I CAN?

YES, THERE'S A VACANT APARTMENT UP THERE.

I'M KIDDING.

YOU CAN STAY WITH ME.

TONIGHT?

YES, TONIGHT. AND TOMORROW NIGHT. AND THE NIGHT AFTER THAT.

AND AFTER THAT?

DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK.

I BETTER GO.

GO INSIDE AND LOCK ALL THE DOORS AND STAY THERE.

AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WORK TOMORROW.

THERE'S BETTER WAYS OF STAYING IN LA THAN WORKING THERE.

ALL RIGHT. I'VE JUST QUIT.

I'LL JUST GRAB A FEW THINGS... HELL, I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING.

JUST BRING YOURSELF.

I BETTER GO.

GO HOME!

GO GET THE GIRL.

I WOULD OFFER YOU A DRINK, BUT I UNDERSTAND...

...YOU'RE ON THE WAGON.

THAT STUFF WILL KILL YOU QUICK.

YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT ME, WHO ARE YOU?

I CHANGED THE COURSE OF YOUR LIFE.

FOUR YEARS AGO...

...WHEN YOU WAS A NARC AT LONG BEACH...

...YOU WERE GETTING TOO CLOSE, SO WE PUT A CONTRACT OUT ON YOU.

I HANDLED IT MYSELF.

DROVE YOUR CAR RIGHT OFF THE ROAD, REMEMBER?

BUT YOU WEREN'T DRIVING, WERE YOU?

YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THE SURPRISE...

...WHEN I PULLED BACK A MATTED MOP OF BLOODY HAIR TO SEE THIS WOMAN'S FACE.

YOUR WIFE, RIGHT?

SHE DIDN'T DIE STRAIGHT AWAY.

IT TOOK A BIT OF TIME.

YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH LUCK WITH WOMEN, DO YOU?

SHE'S DEAD. THEY KILLED HER.

WHERE ARE YOU?

THEY KILLED HER. SHE'S DEAD. THEY KILLED THEM BOTH.

SLOW DOWN. WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHERE ARE YOU?

SHE'S DEAD, ROGER.

CALM DOWN. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. WHERE ARE YOU?

I'M NOT A COP TONIGHT. IT'S PERSONAL.

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT. THERE'S MORE.

I'M GOING TO GET THOSE BASTARDS. I'M GOING TO F*** THEM. I'M GOING NOW.

WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE STILT HOUSE! WE'RE UNDER ORDERS!

THEN THE HOUSE WILL HAVE TO COME TO ME.

THEY KILLED THEM BOTH.

THEY GOT RIKA AND THEY GOT MY WIFE.

S***.

WHAT'S THE DEAL?

YOU TALK TO THE FEDS, BUT YOU DON'T TALK TO ME.

THAT'S NOT FAIR.

WE TRUSTED YOU.

YOU BETRAYED US.

YOU TOOK OUR MONEY!

WE WANT IT BACK NOW...

...YOU SLIMY LITTLE S***.

GIVE HIM MORE. HE LIKES IT.

DON'T TRY AND STOP ME.

I'VE SEEN THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYES BEFORE.

THEY DECLARED WAR ON THE POLICE.

YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

I HEARD IT ON THE RADIO.

WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY.

CAVANAUGH...

...WYLER, SHAPIRO...

...RIKA, VICKI. HOW MUCH F***ING AUTHORITY DO YOU NEED?

YOU GOT A PLAN?

DRIVE AROUND THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE...

...WAIT FOR MY SIGNAL...

...AND THEN JUST GO IN AND SHOOT THOSE F***ERS.

THEY GOT LEO.

BE CAREFUL.

WAIT.

WHAT'S YOUR SIGNAL?

YOU'LL KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS.

SOMEHOW I THINK I WILL KNOW.

FEEL LIKE TALKING?

IT'S THE BIG ONE!

COOL IT. WATCH HIM.

MOVE ME AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS!

RIGGS, YOU CRAZY MOTHER...!

HOLY CHRIST!

- YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH, I'M OKAY.

THANKS.

- WAS ADOLF IN THERE? - HE GOT AWAY.

- I'M GOING TO FIND HIM. - WHAT ABOUT LEO?

WHAT ABOUT LEO?

YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

TAKE MY CAR TO THE POLICE STATION AND WAIT FOR THE FEDERAL MARSHAL.

IT'S BEEN AN EXPERIENCE KNOWING YOU.

- I DON'T WANT A HUG. - GO ON. LUCKY IF YOU SEE HIM AGAIN.

I HAD A LOT OF FUN.

YOU DO YOUR DUTY NOW.

I'M GOING TO REALLY GET THEM NOW.

LISTEN. WAIT.

IS IT OKAY IF I SOUND THE SIREN?

LOUD AS YOU WANT.

REALLY? OKAY. REALLY?

CHECK IT OUT.

ALBA VARDEN IS A CARGO SHIP, NOT A WOMAN.

THE PORT AUTHORITY SAID THAT THE ALBA VARDEN ARRIVED TODAY...

...AND HEADS OUT TOMORROW TO SOUTH AFRICA.

THIS IS THE ELEVENTH DOCK.

IT MUST BE HERE SOMEPLACE. I KNOW I'M RIGHT.

THE SHIP!

WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

THAT CONTAINER THERE WITH THREE HEAVY HITTERS.

LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

I'LL TAKE 2 OF THEM OUT, YOU TAKE 1.

BETTER YET, YOU TAKE 2, I TAKE 1. PULL OVER TO THE SIDE.

- I CAN'T SEE S***! - ME, EITHER. WHAT IS THIS S***?

GOT A LIGHT?

IT'S RUDD'S, WHATEVER IT IS.

I STILL CAN'T SEE S***.

- YOU GOT SOMETHING? - I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A CAR.

S***! FORT KNOX!

HELL, HOW MUCH IS IT?

THOUSANDS.

F***ING MILLIONS.

BILLIONS OF F***ING DONALD TRUMP LOTTO.

LOOK AT THIS.

THESE ARE $1,000 BILLS!

WITH WHAT I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND I COULD PUT ALL MY KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE.

TAKE IT.

F**ING DRUG MONEY.

DO SOMETHING GOOD WITH IT.

RUDD WON'T NEED IT WHERE HE'S GOING.

LOAD THE CONTAINER.

THE NEXT TIME THE SUN HITS THEIR BODIES, THEY'LL BE IN CAPE TOWN.

- HEY, THIS THING'S MOVING. - IT SURE AS HELL IS.

- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW? - I DON'T KNOW.

LET'S SHOOT OUR WAY OUT.

NO, DON'T. I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

OUR MONEY.

MAKE SURE THEY'RE DEAD.

- YOU GO FIRST. I'M TOO OLD. - YOU GO FIRST. I'LL COVER YOU.

- HOW DO WE GET OUT OF HERE? - I'LL GO THIS WAY.

I'LL GO THIS WAY AND CHECK OVER HERE.

OH, S***!

RIGGS, YOU OKAY?

DROP IT, ASSHOLE!

DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!

IT'S JUST BEEN REVOKED.

YOU'RE BREATHING. YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

NO, DON'T DIE.

YOU'RE NOT DEAD UNTIL I TELL YOU.

YOU GOT THAT, RIGGS? YOU'RE NOT DEAD UNTIL I TELL YOU.

YOU GOT THAT?

YOU' RE NOT DEAD UNTIL I TELL YOU.

NOW, BREATHE WITH ME.

BREATHE.

ROG, IN MY POCKET.

I WANT YOU TO THROW THOSE THINGS AWAY. THOSE THINGS WILL KILL YOU.

YOU SON-OF-A-B***H.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE DYING.

I DIDN'T DIE ON YOUR TOILET, I'M NOT GOING TO DIE IN YOUR ARMS.

YOU SON-OF-A-B***H.

WHERE ARE THEY? ARE THEY ALL GONE? DID YOU GET THE BAD GUYS?

THEY BEEN DEKAFFIRNATED.

DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH! JESUS!

DID ANYONE EVER TELL YOU...

...YOU REALLY ARE A BEAUTIFUL MAN?

GIVE US A KISS.

WHERE'D THAT BULLET HIT YOU?

YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHY AM I DOING THIS? WHY?
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
ROGER: WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
- I'M THINKING WE SHOULD CUT THE BLUE WIRE.
- WAIT!
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I THINK.
- YOU THINK MAYBE THE RED?
NO! NO!
I'M THINKING IT'S 8 MINUTES AND 42 SECONDS.
WE CAN GO UPSTAIRS, WAIT FOR
THE BOMB SQUAD, AND HAVE A CAPPUCCINO.
THE BOMB SQUAD NEVER GETS HERE ON TIME.

HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?
IT'S JUST A HUNCH.
A HUNCH?
REMEMBER THE BOMB UNDER YOUR TOILET?

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN UNCONSCIOUS.
ANYTHING YOU SAY AIN'T GONNA BE MUCH.
[TRUCK HORN HONKS]
HEY, RIGGS. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M OKAY. I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO BOOK
THIS GUY FOR NOT WEARING HIS SEAT BELT.
THAT WAS DYNAMITE DRIVING.
ROGER: SHE'S A DYNAMITE DRIVER!
DELORES: I'LL SHOW YOU DYNAMITE!
SHO 'NUFF!
WHAT HAVE YOU TWO BEEN UP TO?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE WERE IN PURSUIT!

I'LL SHOW YOU THIS ROOM FIRST.
IT'S MY FAVORITE.

I LOVE THAT PICTURE WINDOW.
LEO: IT'S JUST BEEN COMPLETELY REPLACED.
MAN: WHY?
A DRUG DEALER CAME THROUGH WITH HIS CAR
AND CRASHED RIGHT IN.
SHOT UP THE WHOLE PLACE.
SON OF A BITCH!
I'M GOING TO CUT HIM OFF AT THE KNEES!
IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. TRUE.

DON'T SMOKE.
RIGGS: I'M ITCHING TO.

CHEW ON THESE.
LEO: I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS. IT'S THE LAW.
IT'S CALLED "FULL DISCLOSURE."
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO DISCLOSE

NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, THE BATHROOM
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY REMODELED...
...DUE TO UNEXPECTED BOMB DAMAGE.
LEO: HEY, COME ON. IT'S OKAY.
SON OF A BITCH!
RIGGS: DON'T, DON'T.
YOU'LL NEVER SELL THE HOUSE.

I HAD TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING.
IT'S THE LAW. "FULL DISCLOSURE."
LEO: YOU MUST HAVE HEARD OF IT?
ROGER: I'M A COP! I'M THE LAW!
RIGGS: GET OFF ME! WHAT IS IT WITH YOU?
LEO: HOLD IT!
OKAY, OKAY.
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T TELL THEM
ABOUT THE NAIL-GUN INCIDENT.
I FORGOT. DID YOU HAVE A PERMIT
WHEN YOU BUILT OVER THE GARAGE?
PERMIT?
HOLD IT! LEO'S HERE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS.
WE'LL GET SOME BACK-DATED PERMITS.
LEO: WHICH PHONE CAN I USE?
ROGER: SUNROOM.

AND IT'S ALL COMING TRUE.
TYRONE: YOU SANK YOUR MONEY INTO THIS,
OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT?
JACK: KNOW WHY IT'LL BE A GOLD MINE?
TYRONE: DO TELL.
BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO LIVE
NEXT DOOR TO A MENACE LIKE YOU.
I CAME TO DO BUSINESS,
NOT TO BE INSULTED BY YOU.
RELAX, TYRONE.
LIKE HOUSES, FRIENDSHIPS NEED
STRONG FOUNDATIONS.
SMITTY, COME HERE. COME HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
DON'T I PAY YOU GOOD AND TAKE CARE OF YOU?
- SURE YOU DO.
- WHAT ABOUT THE STUNT YOU AND BILLY PULLED?
IT WAS A GOOD PLAN. IT WORKED.
IT WORKED? IT DIDN'T WORK.
YOU GOT NAILED, FIRST TIME OUT.
NOBODY WHO WORKS FOR ME
GOES INTO BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
SEE HOW THAT CAN JEOPARDIZE EVERYTHING?
RIGHT, TYRONE?
TYRONE: WHATEVER.
JACK: ESPECIALLY TRYING TO POP
AN ARMORED CAR.
JACK: OKAY, BILLY GOT CAUGHT.
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THAT NOW.
HE'LL HAVE TO FACE THE MUSIC ON HIS OWN.
BUT YOU AND ME...
...WE'RE GONNA START OVER.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
SMITTY: WHATEVER YOU SAY, JACK.
JACK: GOOD.
GLAD YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[SMITTY GROANS]
[CEMENT GURGLING]
NOW WE'VE GOT A RELATIONSHIP
WE CAN BUILD ON.
- EMPLOYEE PROBLEMS. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS?
- YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU INVEST TIME AND ENERGY
INTO TRAINING SOMEBODY.
THEN, THEY GET GREEDY AND DO SOMETHING
STUPID THAT JEOPARDIZES EVERYTHING.
IT'S A BITCH!
STICK AROUND. THIS IS THE GOOD PART.
WE CAN PUT OUR INITIALS IN THERE, YEAH?
TYRONE: JESUS CHRIST!
[CACKLES]
RIGGS: LANKERSHIM AND VINELAND.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
ROGER: RIGHT HERE. RIANNE'S GOT A
NEW JOB. I PROMISED HER I'D STOP BY.
RIGGS: THAT'S A GOOD REASON.
ROGER: ALL RIGHT. HERE WE ARE.
ROGER: YOU GOT ANY SILVER, ANY CHANGE?
RIGGS: WE'RE COPS.
THAT'S RIGHT, WE'RE COPS. NOT CROOKS.
I'LL GET CHANGE.
MAN: GET DOWN! ALL OF YOU!
GET DOWN!
RIGGS! RIGGS!
[RIANNE SCREAMS]
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH A RUBBER GUN?
THIS IS A FILM!
CUT, CUT, CUT! WHO THE FUCK IS THIS LUNATIC?
DIRECTOR: GET HIM OFF MY SET.
ACTOR: THIS ISN'T PART OF THE STORY.
DIRECTOR: CAN WE GET A COP?
RIANNE, I'M SO SORRY.
I FEEL LIKE A MICROBE RIGHT NOW.
YOU REALLY THOUGHT I WAS IN TROUBLE?
RIGGS: I DID.
A REAL COP! GO SIT IN YOUR FUCKING TRAILER!
DIRECTOR: ARE YOU A FUCKING IDIOT?
RIGGS: I APOLOGIZE.
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE, A POLICEMAN.
HE THOUGHT I WAS IN TROUBLE.
ROGER: WE'RE BOTH...
HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS?
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING: YOU'RE FIRED.
HAVE A NICE DAY.
FIRED? RIGGS, WHAT'D YOU DO?
YOU'RE NOT FIRED.
NO, YOU'RE NOT. JUST TAKE IT EASY.
RIGGS: YOU CAN'T FIRE HER
FOR SOMETHING I DID.
I DON'T CARE WHOSE MISTAKE IT WAS!
SHE'S FIRED!
RIGGS: I APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE.
DON'T PUSH HIM!
DIRECTOR: ALL OF YOU, GO!
JUST TAKE IT EASY. DON'T PUSH HIM.
DIRECTOR: GET OFF MY SET, ALL RIGHT?
WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?
GET OFF MY SET!
ON ANY NORMAL DAY,
I'D SMACK YOU IN THE MOUTH.
IS THAT SO?
DON'T!
IT'S A NORMAL DAY.
I'M SORRY. LISTEN, ARE YOU OKAY? I'M SORRY.
RIGGS: I'M ALL THUMBS! HE FELL DOWN!
LET ME HELP YOU.
I SAID, DON'T HIT HIM!
RIGGS: IS SHE FIRED?
DIRECTOR: YES, SHE'S FIRED!
RIGGS: IS SHE FIRED?
DIRECTOR: NO, NO.
ROGER: IT'S OKAY.
RIGGS: DOES SHE GET A RAISE?
DIRECTOR: YES! I SAID, "YES"!
RIGGS: GOOD.
RIGGS: RIANNE, I THINK YOU HAVE
A NEW FRIEND HERE.
WE'D LIKE YOU TO COME BACK.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS FROM CREW]
ROGER: YOU CAN'T SETTLE EVERY PROBLEM
WITH YOUR FISTS.
- I COULDN'T USE MY GUN WITH THAT CROWD.
- SIX MORE DAYS.
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.
DID RIANNE GET HER JOB BACK?
DID SHE GET A RAISE?
I DON'T HEAR A "THANK YOU."
MAYBE I SHOULD BECOME A HOLLYWOOD AGENT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ROGER: IT WON'T WORK.
RIGGS: WHY?
ROGER: YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KILLER INSTINCT.
RIGGS: SON OF A BITCH!
- WE SHOULD'VE PUT A BAG ON THE METER.
- I'LL PUT IT IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.
OH, YEAH? GOOD MAN.
IT'S FULL. PUT IT IN THE BACK SEAT.
- YOU REALLY LIKE THOSE THINGS?
- THESE? THEY'RE GOOD.
[ROGER CHUCKLES]
YOU CAN EAT A BOX OF THEM
AND STILL BE DYING FOR A CIGARETTE.
[ROGER CHUCKLES]
- DID YOU CUT YOURSELF SHAVING?
- YEAH.
RIGGS: OLD RAZOR?
OLD FACE.
YOU'RE LETTING THIS RETIREMENT THING
GET YOU DOWN.
SPEND A FEW MORE YEARS
TO GET USED TO THE IDEA. WHY QUIT?
- I'VE GOT PLANS FOR MY RETIREMENT.
- OH, YEAH, PLANS.
- I DO. BIG PLANS.
- BIG PLANS?
- I'VE HAD THEM FOR A LONG TIME.
- LIKE WHAT?
LIKE...
- THINGS, MAN!
- THINGS!
THINGS!
THINGS THAT I'VE PUT OFF.
OH, THOSE THINGS. I'VE GOT THOSE, TOO.
I SEE YOU'VE GIVEN THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT.
[ROGER SIGHS]
YEAH.
I'VE GIVEN IT A LOT OF THOUGHT.
[GUNSHOT]
[DEEP SIGH]
RIGGS: [YELLS] GODDAMN IT!
COP: WHAT'S GOING ON?
RIGGS: I'M PISSED OFF. YOU NEED A REASON?
COP: I THOUGHT I HEARD GUNFIRE.
RIGGS: GET YOUR HEARING CHECKED!
PUT THAT AWAY!
WHAT'RE YOU LOOKING AT?
HEY, MAN. PEACE.
[THUNDEROUS GUN BLASTS]
COP 1: WHY'D YOU CALL US DOWN HERE?
RIGGS: HOW'RE YOU DOING, SON?
RIGGS: DOES YOUR MOTHER
KNOW YOU'RE HERE?
RIGGS: DID YOU DO THIS?
COP 2: NICE SHOOTING.
BETTER THAN BILLY THE KID.
DIAPER RASH MAKES YOU CRANKY.
GIVE IT TO YOUR MOM.
MAYBE SHE'LL STICK IT ON THE REFRIGERATOR.
- CAN I BORROW YOUR GLASSES?
- YEAH.
RIGGS: WHO'S WEARING?
ROGER, YOU ARE.
WHY ME? YOU GUYS SHOULD BE WEARING.
SQUAD MEMBER:
MR. MURTAUGH, LET ME ASSIST YOU.
I DON'T NEED HELP.
I'VE BEEN DRESSING MYSELF SINCE I WAS 30.
- OKAY, MAN, JUST TRYING TO HELP.
- GET BACK.
ALL YOU PERVERTS, TURN YOUR HEADS.
COP 3: TAKE IT OFF, BABY!
ROGER: HOLD THIS SHIRT.
SQUAD MEMBER: YOU'RE WEARING A GIRDLE!
- HE'S GOT A GIRDLE!
- THIS IS NOT A GIRDLE.
ROGER: THIS IS NOT A GIRDLE. IT'S MY BACK!
MY BACK WENT OUT ON ME.
I HURT MY BACK THIS MORNING LIFTING WEIGHTS.
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
RIGGS: I SAW HIM DO IT.
EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.
I WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT
THESE... IOVELY BULLETS.
CUTE.
NOTICE THE SMOOTH JACKET.
PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE TIP.
NOW YOU'VE ALL SEEN THESE VESTS
STOP A.357 MAGNUM BULLET.

[GUN BLAST]
[GUN CHAMBER CLICKS]
[PULLEY MECHANISM HUMS]
RIGGS: SON OF A BITCH!
COP 1: ARMOR-PIERCING BULLETS?
RIGGS: YEAH, COP KILLERS.
THOSE BULLETS CAME FROM THE GUN
OF A SUSPECT WE ARRESTED YESTERDAY.
THEY'RE OUT THERE ON THE STREETS.
VESTS ARE OPTIONAL, BOYS AND GIRLS.
ESPECIALLY BOYS.
SEE YOU, RIGGS.
ROGER: COP KILLERS.
[WHISPERS] SON OF A BITCH.
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO BILLY PHELPS.
I'LL HAVE HIM BROUGHT IN FOR INTERROGATION.
I'M HERE TO TALK TO BILLY PHELPS.
- CAN I SEE YOUR ID, PLEASE?
- SURE.
WILLIAM PHELPS, ARMORED CAR SUSPECT.
HE'S BEEN MOVED TO INTERROGATION.
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS?
- SURE. I'VE BEEN THERE A LOT.
ROGER: SAME FLOOR.
[WHISPERS] I GUESS NOW YOU'RE RETIRING,
THAT SWISS BANK ACCOUNT...
...WILL COME IN PRETTY HANDY.
HOW MUCH YOU GOT IN THERE, A MILLION?
MILLION AND A HALF?
ROGER: FIVE.
RIGGS: FIVE?
WELL, YOU DESERVE IT.
IT'S BETTER THAN THOSE
MISERABLE DRUG DEALERS GETTING IT.
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
DON'T SWEAT IT. YOU LAUNDERED IT,
DIDN'T YOU? THEY CAN'T TRACE IT.
RIGGS: THEY CAN'T TRACE IT.
ROGER: WHAT?
SO LONG AS I GET AN INVITE
TO CASA DE MURTAUGH, I'M HAPPY.
CASA WHAT?
- I'VE NEVER BEEN TO PORTUGAL.
- STOP JOKING.
SHE'S A COP!
I KNOW SHE'S A COP.
SHE'S PROBABLY ON THE TAKE, TOO.
THE WHOLE FORCE IS BENT.
RIGGS: SHE MAY BE WEARING A SKIRT,
BUT WE'RE ALL BROTHERS.
YOU KNOW I HAVE NOTHING.
I AIN'T BEEN TO PORTUGAL.
RIGGS: LISTEN TO ME.
LORNA: [WHISPERS] SON OF A BITCH.
OFFICER: HOW'RE YOU DOING?
LORNA: FINE.
OFFICER: WHO IS IT TODAY?
RIGGS & LORNA: BILLY PHELPS.
WHO'RE YOU?
FLY ME. I'M YOUR FRIENDLY
PORTUGUESE AIRLINE.
SHE'S INFERNAL AFFAIRS, ROG.
LORNA: HOW'D YOU KNOW?
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF LOOKING AT YOUR FILE FOLDER.
LORNA COLE.
- AND YOU'RE SERGEANT MURTAUGH.
- I USED TO BE.
WHAT'S INFERNAL REPAIRS
WANT WITH OUR COLLAR?
WE'RE TAKING OVER, THANKS.
NOBODY TOLD US THEY WERE TAKING OVER.
NOBODY HAS TO TELL YOU ANYTHING,
PATROLMAN.
I WANT TO GO AND SEE THE CAPTAIN.
YOU WANT TO SEE THE CAPTAIN?
LET'S GO SEE THE CAPTAIN.
LORNA: AND PUT ON A VEST.
RIGGS: OH, ARE YOU WEARING ONE?
ROGER: JUST TAKE IT EASY, MAN.
[RIGGS SIGHS DEEPLY]
[ELEVATOR RINGS]
HEY, GUYS. PHELPS, WILLIAM.
ACTUALLY, HIS NAME'S BILLY.
OFFICER: YOU, TOO?
OFFICER: POPULAR GUY TODAY.
JACK: SOMEBODY WITH HIM?
NO, NOT REALLY.
HE'S DOWN THE HALL TO THE RIGHT.
WANT TO SIGN IN HERE, SARGE?
RIGGS: MISS.
RIGGS: WHAT'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOING HERE?
MURPHY: DON'T START.
I JUST FOUND OUT MYSELF.
THIS IS HERMAN WALTERS,
CHIEF OF INTELLIGENCE.
YOU HAVEN'T MET HIS DAUGHTER,
LORNA DOONE.
LORNA: PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
THE PHELPS CASE HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED
TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
RIGGS: WHY?
MURPHY: I CAN'T TELL YOU.
WALTERS: THAT'S CLASSIFIED.
WE BUSTED OUR BUNS BUSTING THIS GUY.
WE BUSTED HIM.
BUSTED IS RIGHT.
HE SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE HOSPITAL.
ROGER: HE DIDN'T BUCKLE UP.
RIGGS: WE EVEN CITED HIM.
I KNOW, I READ YOUR REPORT.
LORNA: OUR CASES HAVE, UNFORTUNATELY,
CROSSED PATHS HERE.
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.
WE'LL TAKE OVER FROM HERE.
CAPTAIN, WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
WALTERS: THAT'S CLASSIFIED.
ROGER: NO, I'M TALKING TO HIM.
I'M TELLING YOU...
NO, I SAID, "CAPTAIN."
I'M TALKING TO THE CAPTAIN.
WALTERS: THAT'S CLASSIFIED!
ROGER: I'M TALKING TO HIM!
RIGGS: THAT'S BULLSHIT!
MURPHY: RIGGS!
MURPHY: MAYBE THESE GUYS CAN CONTRIBUTE
SOMETHING TO THIS CASE?
FROM THEIR RECORDS,
THEY ONLY CONTRIBUTE MAYHEM AND CHAOS.
NO, I'M CHAOS, HE'S MAYHEM.
WE'RE A DOUBLE ACT.
WHAT ARE WE,
REQUIRED READING OR SOMETHING?
AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU ARE.
IT'S A CROSS BETWEEN POLICE GAZETTE
AND MAD MAGAZINE.
RIGGS: WHAT'S WRONG WITH MAD?
LORNA: NOTHING, I USED TO READ IT...
YOU'VE GOT SOME TASTE.
...WHEN I WAS 12.
RIGGS, LET'S GO.
ROGER: WE BUSTED HIM,
WE CAN TALK TO HIM.
WALTERS: CAPTAIN.
MURPHY: RIGGS. MURTAUGH.
MURPHY: GET YOUR ASSES BACK HERE.
YOU'LL BE NEEDING THESE.
I'M REINSTATING BOTH OF YOU.
ROGER: DON'T YOU JUST LOVE HIM?
RIGGS: YEAH.
ROGER: GOD!
YOU REALLY ARE A BEAUTIFUL MAN.
JUST GET RID OF THE BLUES.
MURPHY: THEY DON'T GO WITH YOUR PONYTAIL.
RIGGS: ABSOLUTELY NOT.
RIGGS: YEAH, RIGHT.
GET A HAIRCUT!
OF COURSE, I WON'T.
WALTERS: YOU'VE EXCEEDED YOUR AUTHORITY,
CAPTAIN.
MURPHY: THAT'S NOT HOW I SEE IT.
WALTERS: THAT'S HOW THE CHIEF WILL SEE IT.
- TAKE IT UP WITH HIM.
- I THINK I WILL.
CATCH UP WITH THEM. WE DON'T WANT THIS
SCREWED UP WITH COWBOY TACTICS.
SON OF A BITCH.
HI, BILLY.
JACK!
BYE, BILLY.
[MULTIPLE SILENCED GUNSHOTS]
SEE YOU, BILLY.
OFFICER: SERGEANT,
DID YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED?
NOT REALLY. IT'S A DEAD ISSUE, I'M AFRAID.
RIGGS: HOW LONG HAS PHELPS
BEEN DOING THIS?
LORNA: DOING WHAT?
RIGGS: THIS ARMORED-CAR THING.
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN ARMORED CARS.
I DON'T THINK SHE'S TELLING US EVERYTHING.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
BOY, THESE SIX DAYS ARE GOING TO BE ROUGH.
ROGER: GOD, BE GOOD TO ME.
MURPHY: SHIT, SON OF A BITCH KNEW
THERE WAS A CAMERA IN THE WALL.
DAMN IT!
HE DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS ONE
IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM.
ROGER: THERE ISN'T.
LORNA: WE INSTALLED THEM SIX MONTHS AGO.
LORNA: EVERY STATION.
MURPHY: THAT'S GREAT.
SIX MONTHS AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT?
THIS IS THE "POLICE POLICE," CAPTAIN.
"POLICE POLICE." VERY GOOD. CAN YOU SAY
THAT THREE TIMES IN A ROW, REAL FAST?
RIGGS: WHY? AM I GETTING TO YOU?
LORNA: ARE YOU TRYING TO BAIT ME?
I'M A MASTER AT IT.
THAT FIGURES.
BAITING MASTER. GREAT, MAN,
TRY ALL THE TRICKS.
FREEZE THAT. STOP IT.
MURPHY: JACK TRAVIS.
BOTH: WHO?
LIEUTENANT JACK EDWARD TRAVIS.
HE WAS ONE OF US.
MURPHY: HELL OF A BRUTAL COP.
HE COULD BEAT A CONFESSION OUT OF ANYONE.
A DIRTY COP.
LORNA: I'VE NEVER SEEN
SO MANY SUSPENSIONS...
... AND REPRIMANDS AND CHARGES
OF MISCONDUCT.
HE'S ALSO AS TOUGH AS THEY COME.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
I DON'T KNOW.
HIS PARTNER AND HIM WERE ON A STAKEOUT.
HE WENT FOR COFFEE, NEVER CAME BACK.
LOOKS LIKE HE'S HAD
ONE CAPPUCCINO TOO MANY.
WE'D BETTER BRIEF WALTERS.
LORNA: EXCUSE ME, CUTE STUFF.
RIGGS: THAT'S HARASSMENT.
ROGER: CUTE STUFF. THAT'S YOU.
RIGGS: CAPTAIN.
LORNA: BOYS, BOYS. JUST THE CAPTAIN.
YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS CASE ENDED
WHEN PHELPS HIT THE FLOOR.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK
AND BEAT YOUR STREET?
LEO: NOW'S THE TIME TO BUY.
MURPHY: NOT NOW.
- HEY, ROGER, ROGER!
- NOT NOW, LEO!
- NOT NOW!
- WE GOT TO TALK, BABE, OKAY?
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. YOU'VE GOT TERMITES.
TERMITES?
- OH, GOD!
- YOU'RE INFESTED!
THE ONLY THING HOLDING UP YOUR HOUSE
IS THE PAINT.
WE SHOULD GO.
LEO, COULD YOU GET THE PLACE FUMIGATED?
WE SHOULD PULL EVERY FILE ON THIS GUY.
I KNOW THIS GUY.
ARE YOU WATCHING GERALDO?
RIGGS: WHAT?
LEO: I KNOW THE GUY.
RIGGS: HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?
LEO: I'VE SEEN THE GUY BEFORE.
ROGER: WHERE?
LEO: I DON'T KNOW. I RECOGNIZE HIM...
HIS NAME IS JACK TRAVIS.
DOES THAT RING A BELL?
HANDS OFF THE CLOTHES. OKAY?
I'M THINKING. LET ME THINK.
IT WAS A BIG PARTY.
SOMEONE BROUGHT A MONKEY
THAT KNOCKED OVER THE SALAD BAR.
AND THIS GUY COMES IN
AND INTRODUCES ME TO ANOTHER GUY...
...WHO WANTS A FAVOR.
- I GOT IT! I GOT IT!
- WHAT?
HE'S GOT IT!
- I REMEMBER!
- YOU REMEMBER!
DON'T DO IT. DON'T LET THE EARRING FOOL YOU.
- WE'RE BACK. WE'RE BACK!
- YEAH. YEAH.
LISTEN, LISTEN.
CAN I HAVE A GUN THIS TIME?
[ECHOING] NO!
[CRASH, AMBIENT GAME NOISE]
[SCATTERED CHEERING, HOLLERING]
OKAY, THIS IS IT! THESE GUYS ALWAYS
WANTED ME TO DO FAVORS FOR THEM!
LIKE, SOME GUYS WANTED BROADS,
ANOTHER GUY WANTED CUBAN CIGARS.
YOUR GUY, HOCKEY!
LEO: THE BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE!
RIGGS: WHERE'RE THE SEATS?
ROGER: YEAH?
PROBABLY BY THE GLASS.
DOES "NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK"
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
WHY DON'T WE SPREAD OUT?
IF WE ALL TAKE A DIFFERENT DIRECTION,
IT'D BE LIKE OLD TIMES.
DON'T PUSH, LADY!
I'M ON POLICE BUSINESS HERE!
JUST TAKE IT EASY!

WE KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE. WE KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE. JUST STAY IN YOUR SEAT.
DON'T BE STUPID.
I'LL BE THERE TO ESCORT YOU OUT IN A MINUTE.
THERE'S A POLICEMAN AT EVERY EXIT,
SO IT'S NO USE TRYING TO RUN.
ROGER: SMART SON OF A BITCH.
RIGGS: JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE.
THANKS FOR YOUR COOPERATION.
PLAY ON, BOYS.
[WHISTLE BLOWS, SCATTERED APPLAUSE]
FAN: COME ON, LET'S GO!
GET OUT OF MY FUCKING WAY!
OOH, OOH! RIGGS!
ROGER!
EXCUSE ME.
RIGGS!
REFEREE: YOU CAN'T BE ON THE ICE!
[THUD]
I GOT HIM! I GOT HIM!
LEO: YOU HAVE THE RIGHT...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
[REFEREE'S WHISTLE BLOWS]
[THUD]
[SILENCED GUNSHOT]
JACK: FUCKING WEASEL!
REFEREE: WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?
RIGGS: I'M LAPD! LAPD!
REFEREE: I DON'T CARE!
YOU CAN'T BE ON THE ICE!
ROGER: I GOT HIM!
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, PAL. STAY CALM.
LEO: MAKE SURE YOU TELL MY MOTHER!
WHERE'D HE GO?
DOWN THERE!
SON OF A... BITCH!
HE THINKS I DON'T KNOW I'M DYING.
I KNOW IT.
ROGER: YOU'LL BE OKAY.
LEO: I'M DYING, ROGER.
I'M CHOKING, SEE?
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY DIE.
ROGER: LEO, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
MY BODY'S NUMB! I CAN'T FEEL IT!
I'M GOING TO DIE, I KNOW IT! WHAT?
YOU'RE LYING ON THE ICE.
LEO: THAT'S WHY I'M COLD?
ROGER: THAT'S WHY YOU'RE COLD.
- THAT'S WHY I'M NUMB?
- THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NUMB.
BUT HE SHOT ME. LOOK AT ALL THE BLOOD.
ROGER: IT'S JUST A FLESH WOUND.
LEO: SO IT'S OKAY.
HE'S OKAY, HE'S OKAY!
HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT! HE'S ALIVE!
[CROWD CHEERS]
DOCTOR: BRING HIM THIS WAY.
LEO: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
LEO: I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT SHOT.
DOCTOR: CALM DOWN.
RIGGS, ARE YOU HERE?
WE'RE ALL THE SAME NOW. WE ALL GOT SHOT.
DOCTOR: YOU'LL BE FINE.
RELAX.
I'M FINE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.
I CAN TAKE THIS.
DOCTOR: JUST CALM DOWN.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. AAH!
DOCTOR: YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE TONIGHT.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA.
YOU SHOULDN'T RUSH THIS, DOC.
RIGGS: YOU SHOULD REST UP.
A DUM-DUM WOUND CAN BE SERIOUS.
WHAT'S A "DUM-DUM WOUND"?
YOU DON'T KNOW? A GUY ON THE FORCE
GOT HIS THUMB SHOT OFF BY A DUM-DUM.
FROM THE SHOCK,
HE WAS DEAD TWO DAYS LATER.
DEAD TWO DAYS LATER?
LEO: HE DIED FROM DUM-DUMS?
DOCTOR: WE'LL KEEP YOU OVERNIGHT.
ROGER: MAKE IT TWO.
TWO DAYS?
OKAY, WE'LL KEEP HIM TWO DAYS.
IS THAT LEO'S CHART?
DOCTOR: TWO DAYS,
THEN YOU'LL BE AS GOOD AS NEW.
LEO: I SHOULD BE WITH THEM.
I SHOULD BE WITH... OW, OW!
HOW DO YOU SPELL, "PROCTOLOGICAL"?
ROGER: RECTAL EXAM?
- NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO LEO.
- SURE, WE CAN.
WHY'S SHE...
PLEASE, MR. GETZ.
DOCTOR: YOU'VE BEEN SHOT IN THE ARM?
LET HER TAKE IT. YOU'LL GET IT BACK.
DOCTOR: THERE'S A CLOCK IN YOUR ROOM.
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A "DUM-DUM WOUND"?
RIGGS: IT SOUNDED LIKE ONE
WHEN IT HAPPENED.
LEO: SHIT.
RIGGS: TAKE IT EASY. TWO DAYS.
DOCTOR: TWO DAYS AND YOU'LL BE OUT.
NO PROBLEM.
LEO: I'LL SEE YOU GUYS.
RIGGS: WE WON'T MAKE A MOVE
WITHOUT YOU.
I THOUGHT THAT BULLET SOUNDED DIFFERENT.
DOCTOR: RELAX.
THEY'LL BE THERE WHEN YOU GET OUT.
LEO: I'M FINE.
LEO: YOU OWN YOUR HOUSE, DOC?
DOCTOR: WHAT?
- YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE MY FACE?
- NO, SIR.
WATCH.
RIGGS: IT'S ABOUT TIME. THESE DOGGY TREATS
ARE OKAY, BUT I NEED SOME HUMAN FOOD.
ROGER: DON'T WORRY. I'LL MAKE YOU
THE BEST THING YOU'VE EVER HAD.
RIGGS: GOOD.
ROGER: YOU EVER EAT
ONE OF MY HAMBURGERS?
RIGGS: I'VE BEEN LUCKY SO FAR.
ROGER: FAST EDDIE!
ROGER: HOW'S BUSINESS?
EDDIE: BOOMING. CAN'T YOU TELL?
ROGER: YEAH, I'M LOOKING AT IT.
DID YOU MEET MY PARTNER?
I WANT TO COOK ONE
OF THOSE MONSTER BURGERS FOR HIM.
EDDIE: GO FOR IT.
ROGER: ALL RIGHT.
RIGGS: YOU'LL LET HIM COOK?
EDDIE: DO I HAVE A CHOICE?
ROGER: NO, BECAUSE IT'S WEDNESDAY.
RIGGS: HE'S TOO BIG TO ARGUE WITH.
IN THAT CASE, GIVE ME A MACROG.
RIGGS: HOLD THE HAIR.
DID YOU WASH YOUR HANDS?
KEEP JOKING. BUT I GUARANTEE
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS BURGER...
...AND YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY FRIENDS,
YOU KNOW THAT, EXCEPT YOU.
ROGER: HE'S A COMEDIAN IN HIS SPARE TIME.
WHEN IS HE GONNA SAY SOMETHING FUNNY?
ARE YOU GONNA PUT THAT OUT?
RIGGS: YOU'RE FINISHED WITH IT, YEAH?
DO YOU MIND? THANKS.
SORRY. I WAS JUST LOOKING AT IT.
CHEW ON THIS ONION.
HE'S QUITTING, SO HELP HIM.
I WAS ONLY LOOKING AT IT.
ROGER: THE FIRST THING IS THE FAT.
ROGER: EVERYONE SAYS, "CUT THE FAT."
MY UNCLE SAID, "YOU CUT THE FAT,
YOU KILL THE BURGER." RIGHT?
EDDIE: YEAH.
ROGER: THERE'S AN ART TO IT.
YOU JUST CAN'T PLOP THIS ON THE GRILL.
ROGER: GENTLY COAX THE FLAVORS OUT.
YO, HEY, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
ROGER: A LITTLE PEPPER,
THEN YOU MASSAGE IT A LITTLE BIT.
JUST A LITTLE BIT.
[SINGS] "SWEET, SWEET MEAT"
SHIT, MAN, FEEL IT.
OKAY, GUYS!
RIGGS: LAPD. LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS! GET THEM UP!
RIGGS: IN THE CAR! GET THEM UP THERE!
LET ME SEE BOTH OF THEM! COME ON!
[MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS]
HEY, RIGGS!
[GUNSHOTS]
[TIRES SCREECH]
[RIGGS GROANS]
RIGGS!
ROGER: DON'T YOU LOVE ME? FOR FIVE DAYS!
[BANG]
DON'T DO THAT TO ME!
ROGER: RIGGS, ARE YOU OKAY?
RIGGS: YEAH.
WHO DID IT?
ROGER: ALL RIGHT, ASSHOLE!
I WANT TO SEE YOUR HANDS, RIGHT NOW!
[MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS]
BACK ME UP, RIGGS!
ROGER: DARRYL?
FUCK, NO!
FUCK, NO!
CALL AN AMBULANCE!
CALL AN AMBULANCE! BREATHE!
ROGER: PLEASE, BREATHE!
BREATHE!
CALL AN AMBULANCE!
COME ON! BREATHE! OH, GOD!
FUCK, IT'S DARRYL!
OH, GOD, DON'T DO THIS TO ME! BREATHE!
RIGGS: HE'S DEAD.
ROGER: BREATHE! BREATHE!
ROGER: GOD, DON'T DO THIS!
RIGGS: HE'S DEAD.
RIGGS: HE'S DEAD! ROG, HE'S DEAD!
HE'S DEAD, ROG!
DON'T MESS WITH THE CORPSE.
HE'S DEAD. COME ON, MAN,
IT WAS A CLEAN SHOOT.
IT'S OKAY, IT WAS A CLEAN SHOOT.
HE WAS GONNA DO YOU
AND HE WAS GONNA DO ME.
IT'S OKAY. ARE YOU OKAY?
IT'S NOT OKAY.
I KNOW THAT KID.
I KNOW THAT KID.
ROGER: HE'S NICK'S FRIEND.
[PHONE RINGS]
NICK: I GOT IT, MOM.
TRISH: I'LL GET IT.
HELLO?
HI, MARTIN.
HE'S NOT HERE.
[WHISPERS] OH, MY GOD!
THANKS.
[CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT]
FUCK!
[TIRES SCREECH]
RIGGS: HOW'RE YOU DOING?
TAKING YOUR VITAMINS?
MURPHY: RIGGS, HOW'S MURTAUGH?
RIGGS: HE'S GOOD. HE'S FINE.
- I'M SURE HE'S ANYTHING BUT FINE.
- REALLY, HE'S OKAY.
- I'D REALLY LIKE TO TALK TO HIM.
- THAT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO LEAVE HIM ALONE.
LET'S GET SOMETHING FOR YOUR COLD.
DOCTOR: I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
LORNA: WE HAVE TO TALK.
RIGGS: TALKING TO YOU IS BAD FOR MY IMAGE.
LORNA: I'M AFRAID I INSIST.
RIGGS: OH, YOU INSIST?
IN THAT CASE, LET'S FIND SOMEPLACE PRIVATE.
STEP INTO MY ORIFICE.
RIGGS: HEY, BECKER, HOW'S IT HANGING?
BECKER: HEY, RIGGS.
BECKER: CLIP ANY WRONG WIRES LATELY?
RIGGS: I HAVEN'T DONE THAT
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.
NEXT TIME, WAIT FOR THE BOMB SQUAD.
BECKER: YEAH, IT'S OUR JOB.
I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
WE SAVED A CAT, THOUGH.
GREAT. I LOVE CATS.
RIGGS: GO AHEAD, TALK. I'M LISTENING.
YOU PURPOSEFULLY WITHHELD INFORMATION
CONCERNING A CASE UNDER MY INVESTIGATION.
DAMN RIGHT, I DID.
BECKER: CAREFUL, SHE'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
YOU HAD A TIP ON TRAVIS.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SHARED IT WITH ME.
NO, I TAKE THAT BACK.
YOU WERE REQUIRED TO SHARE IT WITH ME.
I WAS "REQUIRED" TO SHARE IT WITH YOU?
I DON'T HAVE TO SHARE SHIT WITH YOU.
SCHOOL YARD RULES: IF YOU DON'T SCRATCH
MY BACK, I DON'T THROW YOU...
LORNA: OH, COME ON, RIGGS.
I CAN'T DO THAT!
RIGGS: YES, YOU CAN!
WHY DON'T YOU CUT OUT
THIS CLASSIFIED BULLSHIT!
RIGHT NOW! IT'S GIVING ME THE SHITS!
WE'RE COPS. YOU'RE A COP, I'M A COP.
WE'RE BOTH ON THE SAME SIDE, RIGHT?
RIGGS: RIGHT?
LORNA: RIGHT!
GOOD! WHY DON'T WE START TO ACT LIKE IT.
THERE ARE KIDS OUT THERE. BABIES. NO
BRAINS, BUT THEY GOT AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
RIGGS: YESTERDAY,
MY PARTNER NAILED THIS KID...
I KNOW ABOUT MURTAUGH.
YEAH. AND I'M SORRY, RIGGS.
YEAH.
[SIGHS DEEPLY]
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME IN ON THIS?
I CAN HELP YOU.
I REALLY WANT TO HELP YOU,
IF YOU'LL LET ME. LET ME.
WHAT DO YOU SAY? HAVE WE GOT A DEAL?
WASH YOUR HANDS...
...AND MEET ME IN MY OFFICE.
YEAH.
RIGGS: I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
LORNA: MAC-10, 9 MM, SEMI-AUTOMATIC...
BOTH: CONVERTED TO AUTOMATIC
WITH 36 ROUNDS IN THE MAGAZINE.
"ON A SESAME SEED BUN."
VERY ILLEGAL.
THE GUN HAS A HISTORY.
WANNA KNOW ABOUT IT?
TELL ME.
"KILLED A CONVENIENCE STORE CLERK
IN LA COUNTY, JULY 1990.
"USED IN A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING
IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, AUGUST 1990.
"CONFISCATED BY A TRUANT OFFICER
OF THE LA SCHOOL BOARD, OCTOBER 1990."
SCHEDULED FOR DESTRUCTION BY LAPD
SIX WEEKS AGO.
"SCHEDULED FOR DESTRUCTION?"
LORNA: BUT IT NEVER GOT THERE.
INSTEAD, IT FOUND ITS WAY
INTO THE HANDS OF A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY...
...WHO FIRED IT ON A POLICE OFFICER,
YOUR PARTNER.
I THOUGHT IT LOOKED FAMILIAR.
LORNA:
THAT GUN AND 15,000 OTHERS LIKE IT...
...WERE STOLEN FROM A POLICE STORAGE FACILITY
BEFORE THEY COULD BE DESTROYED.
THEY SHOULD BE PAPER CLIPS RIGHT NOW,
OR LICENSE PLATES.
ANYTHING BUT A GUN. HERE WE ARE
BUSTING OUR ASSES ON THE STREETS...
...GETTING THESE WEAPONS OUT OF CIRCULATION
AND NOW THEY'RE HEADED BACK OUT.
BY BUSTING PHELPS, YOU STUMBLED ONTO
SOMETHING THE LAPD'S TRIED TO KEEP QUIET.
THAT'S WHY INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS ONTO THIS.
THEY THINK THIS IS AN INSIDE JOB.
LORNA: THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY KNEW POLICE PROCEDURES.
THEY KNEW WHERE THE GUNS WERE STORED
AND HOW TO GET IN.
THEY EVEN KNEW THE SORTING CODES
ON THE CONTAINERS...
...BECAUSE THEY TOOK THE AUTOMATICS
AND LEFT THE JUNK BEHIND.
LORNA: IT ALL POINTED TO A COP.
RIGGS: OR AN EX-COP.
RIGHT.
BOTH: TRAVIS.
AND YOU LET HIM SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS.
THAT'S CLOSER THAN YOU EVER GOT.
CLOSE, RIGGS?
CLOSE IS A LINGERIE SHOP
WITHOUT A FRONT WINDOW.
DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR A RIDE?
SURE, WHERE ARE WE GOING?
LORNA: IT'S A SURPRISE.
OH, I LOVE SURPRISES.
RIGGS: WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
LORNA: I ACCESSED BILLY PHELPS'
PHONE RECORDS ON MY COMPUTER.
LORNA: HE MADE A DOZEN CALLS
TO THIS ADDRESS.
RIGGS: THAT WAS NICE OF YOU
TO STEAL THAT INFORMATION.
LORNA: SEMANTICS, RIGGS.
RIGGS: "SEMANTICS"?
RIGGS: I'M ALWAYS UP FOR SOME ANTICS.
LET'S GO ON THREE.
LORNA: ONE.
RIGGS: ON THREE, OR THREE AND THEN GO?
LORNA: WHAT?
NEVER MIND. ONE, TWO, THREE.
LORNA: I'VE GOT YOU.
[FEROCIOUS GROWLING]
IT LOOKS LIKE BILLY'S GRANDMOTHER
OWNS A BIG DOG.
IT'S NOT A DOG. IT'S A HORSE.
LORNA: I HATE DOGS, RIGGS.
I DON'T GET IT.
YOU DON'T GET WHAT?
IT'S A DOG. IT'S A FUCKING DOG.
I DON'T GET, "CLOSE, IS A LINGERIE SHOP
WITHOUT A FRONT WINDOW." I DON'T GET IT.
LATER.
[GROWLING]
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
I CAN'T SHOOT A DOG.
PEOPLE, OKAY, BUT NOT DOGS.
I SHOULD TRY TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH HIM.
MAKE FRIENDS?
NOW DON'T RUN, BECAUSE HE'LL ONLY
CHASE YOU DOWN AND KILL YOU.
RIGGS: HERE, BOY.
HERE, BOY.
[LOW AGGRESSIVE GROWLING]
SHIT!
GOOD BOY!
[DOG BARKS AND GROWLS,
RIGGS WHIMPERS]
RIGGS?
[RIGGS GROWLS]
YOU'RE CRAZY.
[RIGGS PANTS AND WHIMPERS]
WANT SOME?
RIGGS: ARE YOU HUNGRY?
YOU'RE A HUNGRY BOY.
DOESN'T ANYBODY FEED YOU? COME ON.
HERE'S MORE. LEAVE SOME FOR ME.
RIGGS: VERY SLOWLY, AS IF YOU'RE NOT HERE,
JUST WALK AWAY.
YOU WANT ME TO GO?
YEAH. THIS IS A GUY SORT OF THING.
LORNA: "GUY SORT OF THING?"
RIGGS: ARE YOU ALONE?
STAY, STAY.
HATCHETT: COME ON, LET'S GO.
HATCHETT: HOW MANY IS THAT?
- FIFTY-FIVE.
- FIFTY-FIVE. ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT EIGHT MORE.
WE'LL GET THESE LATER. LET'S GO.
HI, FELLAS.
WHAT'S IN ALL THESE BOXES?
[RIGGS WAILS]
[THUMP]
HATCHETT: EASY, LET'S NOT KILL HIM, YET.
LET'S SEE WHO HE IS FIRST, ALL RIGHT?
[GASPING] YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.
HATCHETT: SHUT HIM UP!
"SERGEANT MARTIN RIGGS."
- GET THE TRUCK READY.
- RIGHT.
SO, SERGEANT RIGGS...
... HOW DID YOU FIND US?
FREEZE! POLICE!
ANOTHER ONE?
WE NEED A NEW FUCKING DOG.
GET YOUR HANDS UP, ASSHOLE.
GET THEM UP!
[COUGHS AND GASPS]
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER.
LORNA: THAT'S BETTER.
[COUGHS]
VERY GOOD.
DROP IT, MISS.
RIGGS: NOW, LOOK!
[CAR ENGINE REVS]
[TIRES SCREECH]
RIGGS: OKAY, I'M ON! NO, I'M NOT!
WAIT!
WAIT, WAIT!
RIGGS: SERGEANT COLE!
GET DOWN! GET DOWN!
[MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS WHIZZ, GLASS SHATTERS]
HATCHETT: GET THOSE CASES
AND KILL THAT DOG!
[TIRES SCREECH]
[GUNSHOTS]
[DOG BARKING]
RIGGS: STOP!
- THE DOG. WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO FIGHT?
- CATHOLIC SCHOOL. FORGET THE DOG!
RIGGS: HERE, BOY!
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE DOG!
RIGGS: HOLD IT, HOLD IT. HURRY UP!
GOOD DOG. GOOD PUPPY. GO!
STOP!
LORNA: WHAT?
RIGGS: GUNS.
RIGGS: IT'S FULL OF GUNS.
LORNA: GRAB ONE!
RIGGS: YOU GRAB ONE!
LORNA: CHICKEN.
RIGGS: STEP ON IT.
[GUNSHOTS]
GET THAT CRATE! COME ON!
[DOG BARKING]
TYRONE: HATCHETT, YOU SAID NOT TO WORRY
ABOUT THE POLICE...
... BUT THE COPS ARE ALL OVER YOU!
THEY GOT MY GUNS.
THEY'LL COME AFTER ME, NEXT!
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THE DEAL'S OFF!
GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF, TYRONE.
WE HAVE A DEAL.
NOBODY BACKS OUT.
TYRONE: YOU SAID YOU HAD THE COPS
UNDER CONTROL.
I SEE THAT ISN'T SO. GIVE ME ONE REASON...
TYRONE:
... WHY I SHOULD DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD REASON.
TYRONE, THIS IS TRAVIS.
YOU BACK OUT NOW, AND I'LL MAKE SURE
ONLY YOUR DENTIST CAN IDENTIFY THE BODY.
IS THAT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON FOR YOU?
BUT I NEED AMMO!
I'M OUT OF BUSINESS WITHOUT AMMO!
I NEED THE GOOD STUFF.
YOU'LL GET THE AMMO. THE GOOD STUFF.
"THE GOOD STUFF." JESUS.
JACK: TIME TO PAY
ANOTHER VISIT TO THE LAPD.
YOU LOOK LIKE I FEEL.
HEY?
RIGGS: HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING
I CAN PUT ON MY HEAD?
THE HAT IN THE CLOSET.
YOU'RE ALL HEART. HERE I THOUGHT
YOU'D GET ALL TENDER AND MATERNAL.
I WAS RAISED WITH FOUR BROTHERS.
WE GOT HURT OFTEN, BUT IF NO BONES WERE
BROKEN OR BLOOD GUSHED, NOBODY CARED.
LOOK, BLOOD. SEE? BLOOD.
LORNA: IT'S NOT GUSHING.
RIGGS: IT WAS FREE FALLING EARLIER.
COULD YOU BRING ME A NEEDLE AND THREAD?
SOME PEROXIDE. I'LL PATCH IT UP MYSELF.
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.
I WASN'T.
WHAT'S WITH YOU?
[THREE STOOGES THEME MUSIC PLAYS
ON COMPUTER]
RIGGS: BOYS.
LORNA: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LORNA: I SAID NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING.
RIGGS: IT CAME ON BY ITSELF.
ALL BY ITSELF. WHAT ARE YOU, A WISE GUY?
RIGGS: YOU DON'T LIKE TO SHARE YOUR TOYS?
- THIS ISN'T A TOY.
- WHAT IS IT?
- THIS IS A WEAPON.
- A WEAPON?
USED PROPERLY, A VERY EFFECTIVE WEAPON.
WHAT, DO YOU THROW IT AT PEOPLE?
LORNA: YOU'LL GIVE YOURSELF A HERNIA.
COME HERE. SIT DOWN.
LORNA: RIGHT HERE.
RIGGS: TAKE A LITTLE OFF THE TOP.
LORNA: RIGHT HERE.
RIGGS: DO YOU BRING
ALL YOUR INTERROGATIONS HOME?
LORNA: WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
RIGGS: IT'S BACK HERE.
RIGGS: CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
LORNA: TURN YOUR HEAD.
RIGGS: CAREFUL.
LORNA: THIS?
LORNA: THIS SCRATCH?
RIGGS: IT FEELS LIKE THE GRAND CANYON.
OH, GOD.
HOLD STILL.
LORNA: OH, GOD. WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.
BE GENTLE WITH ME.
I SEE THIS ISN'T VIRGIN TERRITORY.
WHAT IS THIS? A KNIFE?
THAT'S AN AX.
SOME GUY MISTOOK MY HEAD FOR A LOG.
- THAT'S A NATURAL MISTAKE.
- WHAT, I HAVE A WOODEN HEAD?
- LOOK AT THAT.
- A KNIFE.
KNIFE? THAT'S VERY NICE.
THIS IS ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S PAVEMENT, DRAGGED DOWN CRENSHAW.
THAT'S GREAT. LOOK AT THAT TEXTURE.
LOOK AT THIS.
SAME THING. THIRD AND HIGHLAND.
RIGGS: DRAGGED FOR ABOUT HALF A BLOCK.
LORNA: THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
FEEL THAT TEXTURE. CHEESE-GRATER TIME.
RIGGS: MOVING TRUCK.
LORNA: MOVING TRUCK?
MOVING BULLET.
RIGGS: MOVING BULLET?
LORNA: HERE. THIS IS THE BEST.
IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE BACK.
RIGGS: RIGHT THROUGH?
YOU'RE LUCKY. WAS IT A.22?
IT'S A.38.
THAT'S A.38? THAT'S WIMPY.
THIS IS A.38.
YOURS IS BIGGER THAN MINE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
MAYBE NOT, BUT LOOK.
A WHOLE FAMILY OF.44S ON THE BACK.
RIGGS: THERE THEY ARE.
LORNA: THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
ONE HIT MY LUNG. I WAS BREATHING
BLOOD BUBBLES. IT WAS DISGUSTING.
BLOOD BUBBLES. OKAY.
RIGGS: YOU GOT ONE?
PUMP-ACTION. 12-GAUGE.
LORNA: RIGHT DOWN HERE. WENT THROUGH.
RIGGS: THAT MUST HAVE HURT.
LORNA: RIGHT.
NOT TOO CLOSE.
RIGGS, IF HE WERE THAT CLOSE, I'D BE DEAD.
I CAN BEAT IT. I CAN BEAT IT.
- I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
- YOU GOTTA SEE THIS.
LORNA: I BELIEVE YOU.
RIGGS: THIS GUY HAD A KNIFE.
RIGGS: YOU'LL LOVE IT. HE STUCK IT IN MY LEG
AND RAN IT AROUND EIGHT TIMES.
LORNA: I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
RIGGS: LOOK!
NO, I SAID FORGET IT.
THIS IS A BLUE-RIBBON EVENT.
FORGET IT, RIGGS.
YOU STARTED THIS.
LORNA: YEAH, I CAN END IT.
RIGGS: YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A VERY POOR LOSER.
I DIDN'T LOSE.
RIGGS: YES, YOU DID.
LORNA: NO, I DIDN'T LOSE.
RIGGS: YOU LOST.
LORNA: I CONCEDED.
NO, I CONCEDED. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN LOSING AND CONCEDING.
YOU CONCEDED OR YOU'RE CONCEITED?
LORNA: YOU THINK I'M CONCEITED?
RIGGS: YEAH.
TELL ME YOU LOST. ADMIT TO IT.
I'LL GET YOU A BAND-AID.
RIGGS: TELL ME YOU LOST.
LORNA: I SAID, "DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING."
[SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC, BACKGROUND]
YOU'RE GOING TO SMACK
THE SHIT OUT OF ME, RIGHT?
I CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.
THIS COULD BE A SERIOUS ETHICAL BREACH HERE.
RIGGS: I NEVER MADE IT
WITH ANOTHER SERGEANT BEFORE.
SHUT UP, RIGGS.
[SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC, BACKGROUND]
[DOG WHINES]
[RIGGS GASPS]
OH, DAMN, RIGGS.
ROGER: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU WERE DOING.
WHO SENT YOU? TRISH?
YOU'RE DOING PRETTY WELL.
TRISH DIDN'T SEND ME.
RIANNE CAME TO SEE ME.
SHE ASKED ME TO FIND YOU.
TO YOUR PLACE?
WELL, THAT'S WHERE I AM.
- MY DAUGHTER CAME TO YOUR TRAILER?
- YEAH.
- MY DAUGHTER CAME TO YOUR TRAILER?
- COME ON, SHE WAS WORRIED.
GET OFF OF MY BOAT, RIGGS!
- COME ON.
- GET OFF MY BOAT!
YOU'RE DRUNK.
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.
- THIS ISN'T GOING TO DO YOU ANY GOOD.
- GIVE ME THAT.
GIVE ME THAT.
ROGER, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
YOU GOT THREE DAYS UNTIL YOU RETIRE.
THIS WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD.
YOU SELF-RIGHTEOUS BASTARD! GIVE IT...
DON'T DO THIS, OKAY? PLEASE?
GIVE IT TO ME, DAMN IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW, SHOOT ME?

TAKE YOUR FINGER OUT OF MY BOTTLE.

THE BOTTLE'S GOING SAILING.
SON OF A BITCH!
[THUD]
NOT BAD FOR AN OLD MAN.
ARE YOU FINISHED?
NO, I GOT ANOTHER BOTTLE IN THE GALLEY
AND I'M GONNA GET IT.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
RIGGS: DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF!
YOU GOTTA CUT THIS OUT.
OH, MAN, I'M SORRY. ARE YOU OKAY?
RIGGS: COME ON. SIT DOWN.
ROGER: YOU HIT ME.
RIGGS: COOL IT, WILL YOU?
CUT IT OUT. GIVE IT UP, OKAY?
GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD. HIT ME AGAIN.
I DON'T WANT TO HIT YOU!
YOU THINK I LIKE THIS SHIT?
HIT ME AGAIN. YOU THINK I'M AFRAID OF YOU?
- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT.
- OF THAT KUNG-FU SHIT?
PLEASE, ROG.
THAT KID WAS A KILLER, ALL RIGHT.
THAT WASN'T A TOY IN HIS HAND.
THAT WAS A MACHINE PISTOL
WITH TWIN CARBINES AND ALL THE TRIMMINGS.
HE WOULD HAVE DRILLED YOU...
...ME, ANYBODY THAT CAME ALONG.
YOU HAD NO CHOICE.
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO YOU. IT HAPPENED TO ME.
IT HAPPENED TO ME!
MY GOD, I KILLED THAT KID!
ROGER: I KILLED THAT BOY.
YOU'VE KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE.
ROGER: YOU'VE KILLED A FUCKING
LOT OF PEOPLE! YOU DON'T KILL A BABY!
YOU'VE GOT ICE IN YOUR VEINS.
YOU DON'T KILL A BOY LIKE NICK.
YOU SELFISH BASTARD!
YOU SELFISH BASTARD!
YOU'RE JUST THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF.
RIGGS: WHAT ABOUT ME?
WE'RE PARTNERS! WE ARE PARTNERS.
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU, HAPPENS TO ME.
AFTER ALL THE SHIT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,
DON'T YOU GET IT?
RIGGS: DON'T YOU GET IT?
WHEN YOU RETIRE, YOU'RE NOT JUST
RETIRING YOU, YOU'RE RETIRING US.
RIGGS: YOU'RE RETIRING US.
ROGER: THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.
YES, IT IS.
ROGER: IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM!
RIGGS: YOU'RE THE ONLY FAMILY I'VE GOT!
I'VE GOT THREE BEAUTIFUL KIDS.
I LOVE THEM AND THEY'RE YOURS!
TRISH DOES MY LAUNDRY.
I LIVE IN YOUR ICEBOX. I LIVE IN YOUR LIFE!
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
- I DON'T CARE.
- YES, YOU DO!
ROGER: I DON'T CARE.
RIGGS: YES, YOU DO!
ROGER: [SCREAMS] I DON'T CARE!
RIGGS: [YELLS] YES, YOU DO!
ROGER: I DON'T CARE!
RIGGS: YOU DO SO!
I DON'T CARE!
I DON'T CARE! I DON'T CARE!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING ANYMORE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING.
I HAD THREE DAYS, AND NOW THIS.
I'M SORRY.
RIGGS: THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
ROGER: NO, I'M REALLY SORRY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE...
...THAT MY RETIREMENT
WAS GONNA SCREW YOU UP.
FORGET IT. I HAVEN'T GOT ANY PROBLEMS.
I WAS OUT OF LINE SAYING THAT SHIT.
LOOK, MAN...
RIGGS, LOOK...
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, RIGGS.
AND YOUR PROBLEMS ARE MY PROBLEMS.
LIKE YOU SAID, WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU...
...HAPPENS TO ME. SO TRY ME.
ROGER: I'M HERE FOR YOU.
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY PROBLEMS.
YES, YOU DO. WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS.
YOU HELP ME...
...AND I'M GONNA HELP YOU.
I DO HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM.
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
THIS IS PIDDLY SHIT.
YES, I DO. I WANT TO HEAR IT.
ROGER: TELL ME.
RIGGS: THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
RIGGS: YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
ROGER: I'M HERE. I'M HERE.
WELL...
I THINK MAYBE I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE
THAT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE.
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
RIGGS: HELP ME.
ROGER: I OUGHT TO LET YOU DROWN,
YOU TRAITOR.
RIGGS: HELP ME.
RIGGS: COME ON IN.
WHAT DID YOU HIT ME FOR?
'CAUSE YOU SLEPT WITH RIANNE.
I DID NOT.
ROGER: WHO DID YOU SLEEP WITH?
RIGGS: I SLEPT WITH SERGEANT COLE.
SERGEANT COLE FROM TRAFFIC?

I WANT TO KNOW, NOW!
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?
[ROGER GRUNTS]
DO YOU SEE THIS GUN? I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE IT CAME FROM! NOW!
WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR FRIEND, TRAVIS.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM.
RIGGS: WRONG ANSWER.
YOU'RE PULLING ON THE WRONG STRING.
THAT'S NOT A VERY PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE.
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS?
RIGGS: SORRY! LAPD.
WE'RE JUST DOING A FEW ROUTINE INQUIRIES.
HAVE YOU BEEN CHECKED FOR LUMPS RECENTLY?
GIVE ME MY FUCKING WALLET!

I TOLD YOU BEFORE, MORON,
I DON'T KNOW JACK TRAVIS.
I DIDN'T SAY HIS NAME WAS JACK.
YOU BETTER START TELLING ME
MORE THAN JACKSHIT.
RIGGS: COME ON.
- MEN CROSS THE STREET WHEN THEY SEE ME.

I'M NOT YOUR ENEMY, CAPTAIN.
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB.

WANT TO TRY IT SOMETIME?

YOU CAN'T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS.
OLD DOG, MY ASS.
LET ME TRY SOMETHING. WATCH THIS.
IT'S CALLED A BACKSPIN KICK.
RIGGS: PIVOT ON THE RIGHT,
KICK WITH YOUR LEFT...
...AND YOU WHIP THAT HEAD AROUND
TO CATCH THE TARGET OVER THERE.
LIKE THIS. GET THAT HEAD AROUND

LIKE SO.
SO, YOU WHIP THE HEAD.

REMEMBER, PIVOT RIGHT, KICK LEFT,
GET THAT HEAD AROUND, SPOT THAT TARGET.

HE CAN'T HOLD HIS WATER.
GET BACK TO WORK!

OH, ROG, I'M SORRY.
[RIGGS LAUGHING]
SERGEANT MURTAUGH?
YOU COULD BE EXPERIENCING SOME
TRANSITIONAL ANGER CAUSED BY THE SHOOTING.
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

YOU LOOK GOOD IN RED. THAT'S YOUR COLOR.

OH, SHIT!
WHERE'S SERGEANT MURTAUGH?

RIGGS: I REMEMBER YOU.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND
THE LOVELY SERGEANT MURTAUGH?
ACTUALLY, HE'S COWERING DOWN

DELORES: WHERE IS THE SERGEANT?
RIGGS: HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.
RIGGS: BUT HE'S TALKED OF NOTHING
BUT YOU ALL WEEK.
DELORES: SHUT MY MOUTH.
RIGGS: THE MAN'S ON FIRE.
DELORES: WHAT'S THE MATTER, BABY?
RIGGS: A LITTLE SCIATICA.
DELORES: YOU TELL HIM DELORES WAS HERE.
YOU TELL THAT MAN...
...THAT HE'S THE JAM IN MY JELLYROLL.
I'LL SEE YOU, BABY, OKAY. BYE-BYE.
SEE YOU.
RIGGS: DELORES SAYS YOU'RE
"THE JAM IN HER JELLYROLL."
I HEARD!
RIGGS: THAT'S A LOT OF WOMAN.
SHE CALLS ME ALL THE TIME. SHE LEAVES ME
NOTES. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE LED HER ON.
LED HER ON? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
SERGEANT, WE HAVE GOT TO TALK.
DOCTOR: YOU'VE GOT TO COME SEE ME.
WE'VE GOT TO WORK. COME ON. LET'S GO.
RIGGS: THANKS ANYWAY, FOR YOUR CONCERN.

SEE HOW EASY THAT WAS?
[TIRES SQUEALING]
JACK: I LOVE IT DOWN HERE. DON'T YOU?
THIS PLACE IS BETTER THAN THE SWAP MEET.
BEST BARGAINS IN TOWN.
COP: GIVE ME THE LOCK-UP KEYS.
THOSE GUYS FROM THE GARAGE,
THEY'RE ALL EX-CONS.
THEY WERE ALL BUSTED BY THE SAME
POLICE OFFICER, JACK EDWARD TRAVIS.
EARLY PAROLES ON
THE WORK-FURLOUGH PROGRAM.
EMPLOYED BY A COMPANY CALLED
MESA VERDE CONSTRUCTION.
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.
YOU DON'T HAVE A PASS.
- MAY I SEE YOUR PASS?
- MY PASS?
HERE'S MY PASS.
LEO: I GOT SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
ROGER: HE'S WITH US.
- HE'S WITH US?
- I SAID THAT?
WHERE'D YOU GET HER FROM?
RIGGS: WHY AREN'T YOU IN THE HOSPITAL?
DON'T MENTION THE HOSPITAL.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO LEAVE ME THERE.
THEY TRIED TO TAKE MY APPENDIX OUT.
LEO: THEY GAVE ME A LAPOTOMY.
- BRAIN SURGERY?
- A LAPOTOMY.
NOT A LOBOTOMY.
CUT YOUR HAIR SO YOU CAN HEAR.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
THE DIFFERENCE IS, FOR A LAPOTOMY,
THEY SHAVE YOUR NETHER REGIONS.
NETHER WHAT?
NETHER... I CAN'T SAY IT IN FRONT OF HER.
POINT TO IT.
- HERE.
- IT MUST BE ITCHY.
IT IS ITCHY. THESE DOCTORS ARE SAVAGES.
WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT A GUNSHOT WOUND
REQUIRES A RECTAL EXAM?
LEO: HUH? HUH?
YEAH. WITH A TELESCOPE
BIG ENOUGH TO SEE VENUS.
I GUESS ALL THEY SAW WAS URANUS.
THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU.
LEO: YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY?
THEY FUCK YOU IN THE HOSPITAL.
FIRST THEY DRUG YOU, THEN THEY FUCK YOU!
WHEN THEY'RE DONE...
...THE INSURANCE COMPANY COMES
AND FUCKS YOU SOME MORE!
$10 FOR A FUCKING ASPIRIN
AND IT ISN'T EVEN COVERED!
THAT'S ENOUGH!
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK HERE.
SO, WHAT'S NEW ON OUR CASE?
ANYTHING NEW? YOU GOT TRAVIS YET?
DID YOU GUYS ADVERTISE?
- HE'S FAMILY.
- WHO'S SHE?
- SERGEANT COLE.
- HOW ARE YOU? LEO GETZ.
ANYTHING YOU NEED, LEO GETS. GET IT?
- I GET IT.
- IT'S REAL ESTATE, NOW...
LISTEN, COME ON, YOU GUYS,
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I OWE THIS GUY ONE.
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO.
YOU CAN GET US A CUP OF COFFEE.
THAT'S GREAT. I TAKE ONE FOR YOU
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU TELL ME?
RIGGS: HE COULD CHECK THIS OUT.
LEO: THAT'S ALL I'M GOOD FOR?
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO.
CHECK OUT MESA VERDE CONSTRUCTION.
FIND OUT ALL THE INFORMATION YOU CAN.
- SURE, I CAN DO THIS.
- CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT NAME?
MESA VERDE, I GOT IT.
WAIT, WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IF THERE'S ANY SHIT THERE, HE'LL FIND IT.
LORNA: WHO IS THAT GUY?
RIGGS: IT'S A LONG STORY.
HERE ARE YOUR KEYS, CAPTAIN.
YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
- DON'T BE STUPID.
- WHAT THE FUCK?
TAKE THE ELEVATOR, GET THE OTHER GUYS.
KEYS. GIVE ME THOSE FUCKING HANDS.
GODDAMN YOU, TRAVIS. FUCK.
STAND THERE.
I CAN GET FASTER RESULTS THAN
THAT REAL ESTATE BROKER.
RIGGS: LEO'S NOT JUST A REAL ESTATE BROKER.
ROGER: HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS
WITH A LOT OF CONNECTIONS.
JACK: THIS IS WHAT WE CAME FOR.
LOAD EVERYTHING ON THE ELEVATOR.
- HOW'D YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND THEM?
- WE GOT IT ALL, JACK.
THE WORLD OF COMPUTERS, MURPH...
YOU USED TO BE ONE OF US, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
YOU KNOW WHAT FUTURE A COP HAS? NONE.
PUNCH A CLOCK FOR 30 YEARS. RETIREMENT.
PENSION.
NOTHING TO DO.
DRUNK AT NOON, BULLET IN THE BRAIN
BY EVENING. NOT FOR THIS KID.
POLICE DEPARTMENT'S GOT IT ALL:
GUNS, AMMO, DRUGS, CASH.
IT'S A ONE-STOP SHOPPING CENTER
IF YOU GOT THE BALLS AND THE BRAINS.
NOT A THING ANYBODY CAN DO ABOUT IT.
YOU'RE ALREADY FUCKING HISTORY
AND YOU KNOW IT.
SORRY. I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.
SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE.
THE PROGRAM'S BEEN ACCESSED
BY SOMEBODY FROM THE OUTSIDE.
WHAT'S BEEN ACCESSED?
AFTER THE GUNS WERE STOLEN, INTERNAL AFFAIRS
MOVED THE CONFISCATED AMMUNITION.
ARMOR-PIERCING BULLETS?
THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS
TO A MORE SECURE LOCATION.
- THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN ACCESSED.
- SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS.
WHERE'S THIS STORE? WHERE'D THEY MOVE IT?
LORNA: LET'S GO.
LORNA: I'M NOT CUT OUT FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
RIGGS: THAT'S A SWITCH.
LORNA: RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING.
RIGGS: WHERE?
LORNA: I'M SHOWING YOU.
COP: SOMETHING GOING DOWN?
RIGGS: NOTHING'S GOING DOWN.
COP: I'M GOING WITH YOU.
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?
- TWENTY-TWO TODAY.
COME ON.
HAVE YOU GOT PROTECTION?
- RIGHT HERE IN MY WALLET.
- NO, YOUR VEST, YOU DUMMY!
SHOULD WE TAKE HIM?
- OKAY, BUT KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.
- STAY BEHIND ME.
RIGGS: COME ON, LET'S GO. QUIET!

OKAY? I DID IT! I DID IT!
ROGER: HEY, LEO!
THE HOUSE IS OFF THE MARKET.
WE'RE GONNA STAY IN THIS "TERMITE-INFESTED
TURKEY" FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS!
TRISH: AT LEAST!
RIANNE: I'LL GET MARRIED HERE!
TRISH: COME ON, OUT.
LEO: YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
TRISH: OUT, OUT.
LEO: NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT. I HAVE CONTRACTS SIGNED.
BECAUSE WE'RE PARTNERS,
NO COMMISSION. OKAY?
PARTNERS?
YOU AND RIGGS OWE ME TWO NEW TIRES.
ROGER: WHY?
BECAUSE BULLETS AREN'T COVERED
IN NORMAL ROAD HAZARD. THAT'S WHY!
LEO: I WANT THOSE TIRES! NO CONDITIONS!
LEO, GET OUT OF HERE!
- DON'T TELL ME TO GET OUT!
- OUT! OUT!
OKAY, I'M GOING.
YOU'RE LUCKY YOUR WIFE'S HERE!
[DOOR SLAMS]

ROGER: I GOTTA IMPROVE MY IMAGE.
[ROGER WHISTLES]
[SIGHS]
BYE, DADDY!
[CAR DOOR SLAMS]
BYE, BABY.
[MOTOR HUMS]
[RIGGS CHUCKLES]
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING AT?
WHY WEREN'T YOU AT MY PARTY?
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T GOING TO RETIRE.
I'VE BEEN WRONG ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS
IN MY LIFE, BUT I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T RETIRE.
WELL, I KNEW YOU COULDN'T STOP SMOKING.
I'M SMOKING TO FORGET
MY DOG-BISCUIT PROBLEM.
WHAT "DOG-BISCUIT PROBLEM"?
I'VE BEEN CHASING MORE CARS LATELY...
...AND WHEN I TRY TO LICK MY BALLS,
I KEEP FALLING OFF THE COUCH.
JESUS CHRIST.
I'M DRIVING. OTHER SIDE.
I'VE GOT NO DISPUTE. I JUST CAME OVER
TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR YOU.
THANK YOU FOR OPENING IT.
DO YOU NEED SOME HELP?
AN OLD FELLA LIKE YOU NEEDS...
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW A FELLA MY AGE IS.
- WHO'S A GRUMPY BASTARD?
- I'M A GRUMPY BASTARD.
ROGER: YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
RIGGS: WHAT?
WHEN I DO RETIRE,
I HOPE YOUR NEXT PARTNER IS JUST LIKE YOU.
THERE'S WINNERS AND THERE'S LOSERS,
AND GOD WOULDN'T DO THAT TO ME.
HE DID IT TO ME.
I KNOW.
SEE WHAT I MEAN?
MY POINT, EXACTLY.
SON OF A BITCH!
ROGER: STAY AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER!
RIGGS: YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
ROGER: I SAW YOU KISS RIANNE.
RIGGS: SHE KISSED ME.
SHE FINDS ME IRRESISTIBLE.
ROGER: THAT'S NOT THE POINT!
RIGGS: IT WAS A PLATONIC PECK
ON THE CHEEK.
ROGER: IF IT'S JUST FRIENDSHIP,
TRY SHAKING HANDS NEXT TIME.
RIGGS: ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH FIBER
IN YOUR DIET?
ROGER: I'M GETTING ENOUGH FIBER!
RIGGS: I'M SPOKEN FOR, OKAY?
RIGGS: I'M GONNA PICK LORNA UP
FROM THE HOSPITAL THIS AFTERNOON.
RIGGS: WE'RE PRACTICALLY...
ROGER: YOU'RE SERIOUS?
RIGGS: WE'VE GOT A DOG AND EVERYTHING.
RIGGS: I FIGURE I CAN MAKE ENDS MEET.
DISPATCHER'S VOICE ON RADIO:
ALL UNITS! ALL UNITS! CODE 2, HIGH.
ROGER: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
DON'T EVEN TRY.
RIGGS: THIS IS US, ROLLING TO CODE 2, HIGH,
AT VERRINA PLACE.
ROGER: SHIT. THIS TIME WE WAIT
FOR THE BOMB SQUAD.
RIGGS: DO YOU THINK I WANT TO END UP
IN UNIFORM AGAIN?
DISPATCHER: 20-WILLIAM-12, THE REA
BOMB SQUAD'S EN ROUTE. ALL UNITS.
BOMB SQUAD: THOSE GUYS GONNA
GET IN THE WAY AGAIN?
ROGER: THERE IT IS. HAPPY? LET'S GO.
RIGGS: WE AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET, ROG.
RIGGS: GET ME CLOSER.
ROGER: IT'S ROPED OFF!
RIGGS: CAN'T SEE
THE BOMB SQUAD ANYWHERE.
ROGER: THEY'RE COMING!
RIGGS: STOP HERE AND I'LL JUST GET OUT.
ROGER: NO, DON'T GET OUT OF THE CAR, RIGGS!
RIGGS: TELL ME,
WAS IT THE RED WIRE OR BLUE...
ROGER: LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
RIGGS: STEP ON THE GAS!
ROGER: THEY'LL NEVER BELIEVE THIS!
RIGGS: I HOPE NOBODY SAW US.
ROGER: THEY'LL BLAME US.
RIGGS: LET'S KEEP COOL. YOU'D BETTER
GET YOUR GIRDLE OUT OF MOTHBALLS.
ROGER: THEY'LL SAY,
"BACK IN UNIFORM AGAIN."
ROGER: TEN MORE YEARS OF THIS!
RIGGS & ROGER: I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT.
LETHAL WEAPON 4 (1998)
RIGGS, YOU SURE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT STREET?
WE MUST BE GETTING WARM.
-YOU SEE ANYTHING?
-WHERE? I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
THIS MUST BE THE PLACE.
HOLY SHIT!
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
JESUS!
WHO'S THIS JOKER?
I DON'T KNOW.
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NRA.
REGULAR ASSHOLE.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
RUN HIM OVER.
WHAT IF HE SHOOTS US WITH THAT RIFLE?
-HE HASN'T YET. MAYBE HE WON'T.
-WHAT IF HE DOES?
DON'T BE A DON'T-BEE.
BE A DO-BEE. BE POSITIVE.
POSITIVE?
-RUN HIM OVER.
-GLAD YOU SEE THINGS MY WAY.
I HOPE HE DOESN'T TURN.
HE WON'T. WE'LL CREEP UP ON HIM
SO HE WON'T NOTICE.
WILL HIM NOT TO TURN.
POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING.
DON'T TURN.
WILL HIM WITH ME.
DON'T TURN AROUND.
I NEED YOU.
DON'T TURN AROUND!
JUST BELIEVE!
DON'T TURN AROUND!
WE'RE BETTER THAN HIM.
WE'RE BETTER!
HE'S TURNING.
THEY JUST BOUNCE OFF HIM!
I SAW! WE'RE IN TROUBLE!
SHIT! I'LL DRAW HIS FIRE.
YOU RUN FOR COVER.
NO, I'LL DRAW HIS FIRE.
YOU RUN FOR COVER.
ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU GOT A WIFE, KIDS.
I GOT LESS TO LOSE!
GET OUT OF HERE!
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU,
BUT LORNA'S PREGNANT.
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
YOU'LL BE A FATHER!
SHE WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU.
SHE WAS AFRAID YOU'D GET ANGRY.
YOU NEVER TALKED ABOUT CHILDREN?
-SHIT!
-A BABY.
THERE'S SOMETHING I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU TOO.
RIANNE'S PREGNANT. YOU'RE GOING
TO BE A GRANDFATHER.
RIANNE'S WHAT?!
RIANNE CAN'T BE PREGNANT.
SHE'S NOT MARRIED.
I DON'T THINK SHE INTENDED TO GET THAT WAY.
THEY ASKING ME TO BE A GRANDDADDY?
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO.
TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF!
WHAT FOR?
OKAY, YOU RUN.
FLAME-O SEES YOU IN YOUR UNDIES.
IT DISTRACTS HIM, THEN I SHOOT.
-SHOOT WHAT?
-THE VALVE ON THAT NAPALM TANK!
BEFORE HE SHOOTS ME?
-MAYBE.
-MAYBE?!
IS HE BLACK?
TOO MUCH ARMOR ON.
I CAN'T TELL!
NO! NOT HIM!
THE FATHER OF THE BABY!
PLEASE LET HIM BE BLACK!
GET GOING! HERE HE COMES!
ARE THOSE HEARTS?
NOT NOW, RIGGS.
JUST HIT THE DAMN VALVE!
ALSO, FLAP AND MAKE NOISES LIKE A BIRD.
FLAP MY ARMS? WHY?
IT'LL DISTRACT HIM MORE.
I NEED HIM TO TURN.
-ON 2!
-WE ALWAYS GO ON 3.
NO TIME FOR 3. 2!
-WHAT ABOUT 1?
-OKAY. 1, 2, GO!
I DON'T WANT TO DIE IN MY UNDERWEAR!
WHY ARE YOU WAITING?
SHOOT THE BASTARD!
RIGGS, YOU THINK THAT BIRD THING HELPED?
I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU'D DO IT.
CUTE SHORTS.
GO SPIT!
I'LL BUY YOU A DOUGHNUT.
DON'T HUG ME WHEN I'M NAKED.
YOU'RE ASHAMED OF YOUR BUTT?
HE'S A LIVELY ONE.
THAT SHARK HURTS MY BOAT,
I TAKE IT OUT ON YOU, LEO.
-I DIDN'T MEAN TO CATCH IT.
-WHY DO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT?
YEAH, WHY KEEP A SHARK?
THE TEETH'LL LOOK GREAT ON A WALL.
THEY GOT TO STOP SNAPPING FIRST.
MAYBE HE'LL FALL ASLEEP.
CONVERSE WITH HIM.
HE'LL NOD OFF.
-HE DON'T LOOK TIRED.
-CHEWING ON LEO WILL WEAR HIM OUT.
SHARKS EAT THEIR OWN KIND?
STOP IT!
I'M IN STITCHES!
OKAY, WHERE'S MY BAG?
STARBOARD SIDE AFT.
STARBOARD, THAT'S LEFT, RIGHT?
NO, PORT'S LEFT.
STARBOARD'S RIGHT.
RIGHT, YEAH. RIGHT SIDE AFT.
GOT IT!
-WHATEVER.
-CHECK BOTH SIDES.
CAREFUL!
HE'S BEHIND YOU, SHARK!
MAYBE WE SHOULD THROW HIM OVERBOARD.
THROW THEM BOTH OVERBOARD.
NO WITNESSES.
WE'D PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH IT.
YOU TOO?
I KEPT MY NOSE OUT OF IT...
...BUT YOU AND LORNA.
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY,
YOU'RE LIVING TOGETHER.
YOU'RE NOT MARRYING.
WHY, DOES THAT VIOLATE YOUR
FAMILY VALUES SYSTEM?
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
RIANNE'S NOT MARRIED EITHER.
THAT'S HITTING BELOW THE BELT.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS MARRIED...
...IT WAS GOOD. YOU KNOW.
YOU PUT THE RING ON.
YOU MAKE THE COMMITMENT.
YOU DO ALL THE....
SHE'S DEAD BECAUSE I'M A COP.
SHE'S DEAD BECAUSE I'M A COP AND I...
I DON'T WEAR THE RING ANYMORE...
...BUT I LOOK, AND IT'S STILL THERE.
I STILL FEEL IT.
IT'S LIKE I'M NOT FINISHED WITH THAT YET.
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
IS THAT BULLSHIT?
NO. IT'S NOT FINISHED.
IT'S NOT FINISHED.
OKAY, YOU DID SAY "AFT"?
A-F-T. AFT!
THAT'S A FUCKING WORD?
IN THE BACK ON THE RIGHT SIDE, LEO!
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT
TO BEGIN WITH, ROGER?!
PEOPLE GET AROUND BOATS AND WATER,
EVERYTHING BECOMES NAUTICAL!
"ASTERN! AVAST, YOU LANDLUBBERS!
MAN THE BILGE PUMP!"
PUMP YOUR FUCKING ASS!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM!
WHAT'S LORNA SAY ABOUT IT?
SHE DOESN'T LIKE NAUTICAL TERMS EITHER.
WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT.
THAT'S PRETTY MESSED UP.
THE BABY'S DUE IN DAYS AND YOU
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT MARRYING?
NO.
I HAVEN'T DONE IT AT ALL.
DO WE WANT LEO TO SHOOT THE SHARK?
I WANT LEO TO SHOOT...
NO, LEO!
WHAT?!
-WHAT'S THE DEAL?!
-YOU'RE SHOOTING A GUN ON MY BOAT!
I'M NOT SHOOTING YOUR BOAT,
I'M SHOOTING JAWS.
NOBODY'S KILLING IT
JUST TO HAVE ITS TEETH!
YOU'RE GRUMPY SINCE YOU
LEARNED YOU'LL BE A GRANDPA.
GET OFF OF ME, WILL YOU?
DON'T FOOL AROUND!
SOME PIECE OF HARDWARE!
GOT A PERMIT?
OF COURSE!
I'M A P.I. NOW.
A GUMSHOE! YOU GET IN
UGLY SITUATIONS. I GOT GUNS!
YOU ARE AN UGLY SITUATION.
YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS.
YOU'RE NOT SAFE.
SMART MOVE, RIGGS.
SHIT!

HE'S GOT IT! HE'S GOT IT!
WHAT'D HE SAY?

I SAID KEEP THE BOAT CLOSER!
WHY LISTEN TO LEO?
SHIT!

-WHAT ABOUT THE SHARK?
SHARK!
DON'T LEAVE ME!
COME ON!
-HURRY UP!
-I'M COMING!
YOU'LL MAKE IT!
THIS IS ALL I GOT LEFT.
FOUR SETS OF PAPERS, TOTALLY GENUINE.
THEY'LL GET IN THE COUNTRY
AND CAN STAY FOREVER.
U.S. CITIZENS.
ASK THEM TO VOTE THE INCUMBENT PARTY.
HELP ME KEEP MY STATE DEPARTMENT JOB.
BLOODY MARVELOUS!
THEY RED-FLAG ASIAN VISAS.
THOSE WERE HARD TO SLIP THROUGH.
THE SHIP'S BEEN IMPOUNDED.
WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILY?
WE DON'T KNOW YET.
DON'T WORRY. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
SOMETHING WRONG?
A SMALL DELIVERY PROBLEM, MR. PROODY.
GOODBYE.
LEAVE!
I'LL FIND THEM.
NOW.
COAST GUARD INTERDICTS
ABOUT ONE A MONTH.
PRETTY RAGGEDY-LOOKING.
SIX WEEKS LOCKED IN A HOLE
WITH ONE TOILET.
RICE AND SOME FISH TO EAT.
LOUSY DEAL FOR 35 GRAND A HEAD.
WHERE'D THEY GET THAT KIND OF MONEY?
DIDN'T. GOT TO WORK IT OFF FROM
THE SNAKEHEADS, THE SMUGGLERS.
-THEY SELL THEM AS CHEAP LABOR.
-SELL THEM?
LIKE SLAVES.
THESE MUST BE THE LUCKY ONES.
THEY'LL CLAIM ASYLUM. SAY THEY WERE
PERSECUTED, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
WE'LL SEND THEM PACKING.
COST YOU AND ME A FORTUNE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO,
"BRING ME YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR...
...YOUR WRETCHED MASSES,
YEARNING TO BE FREE"?
NOW IT READS, "NO VACANCIES. "
I GUESS YOUR PARENTS
WERE NATIVE AMERICANS.
THEY POP ONE EVERY BOATLOAD.
SHOWS THE REST WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF THEY RUN OFF.
HE'S NOBODY'S SLAVE NOW.
DON'T CODDLE THEM, MOVE THEM!
I SEE THIS BARREL COMING DOWN.
MURTAUGH DIDN'T SEE IT,
SO I PUSH HIM.
I KNOCK HIM OVER.
WE'RE IN THE WATER.
I PULL BECAUSE HE CAN'T SWIM.
I GOT TO SAVE HIM.
THERE'S THAT KID.
WHAT'S HIS NAME? BISSEL?
-IT'S A FOOD.
-BURGER!
NO, BISCUITS OR SOMETHING.
HE ALWAYS KISSES MY ASS,
GIVES ME COFFEE AND SHIT.
SERGEANT RIGGS, SERGEANT MURTAUGH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-THAT'S A LONG STORY.
-YOU'RE ALL WET!
-YOU NEED A BLANKET?

STEP BACK, STEP BACK.
SHIT!
HE'S DEAD.
HE'S FUCKING DEAD!
-SHIT!
-WHAT?
THIS IS HOW HE WANTED
TO COME TO AMERICA?
WAS HE IN THE KILLING SECTION?
THIS GUY'S BEEN SHOT FOUR TIMES!
AT CLOSE RANGE, LIKE HE WAS EXECUTED!
HE WAS EXECUTED.
BY THE CREW.
PEOPLE GET KILLED LEFT, RIGHT
AND CENTER IN THIS TOWN!
NOW WE IMPORT VICTIMS?
GANGBANGERS KILL EACH OTHER,
NO PROBLEM!
ONE OF US GETS SHOT,
OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD!
BUT JUST A NORMAL GUY?
WHAT DID HE EVER DO TO ANYBODY?!
-THAT AIN'T RIGHT.
-EASY, BISCUITS.
YOU'LL GET AN ULCER.
SETTLE DOWN.
BLANKET!
SORRY, BLANKETS.
SORRY, I'M LOSING MY HEAD.
I HATE TO SEE BAD THINGS
HAPPEN TO GOOD FOLK.
WE'D STICK AROUND, BUTLER,
BUT YOU'RE IN CHARGE SO...
YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS, IT'S FREE.
YOU'RE ALL WET.
-GET SOME VAPOR RUB ON YOUR CHEST.
-ALL RIGHT, BOOGERS.
HEY, GET THEM OUT OF HERE!
GET THEM OUT OF HERE!
HE TAKES THE JOB KIND OF PERSONALLY.
YEAH, HE'S PRETTY SERIOUS, I'D SAY.
OVERZEALOUS.
JEALOUS OF WHO?
-I DON'T KNOW. WHO?
-YOU SAID HE WAS JEALOUS.
YOU JUST SAID...
I SAID HE WAS ZEALOUS.
FULL OF ZEAL.
HE'S LOUD TOO.
-HE'S LOUD!
-WHAT?
WE BETTER GET UP
BEFORE THE SUN'S UP.
I GOT SOMETHING IN THE LIFEBOAT.
THAT'S OKAY,
I'LL CATCH A SQUAD RIDE.
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR BOAT.
-I'M SORRY.
-SHIT!
SUDDENLY, A BIG FUCKING SHARK COMES...
CAN I SAY THAT?
YOU CAN SAY IT, BUT WE CAN'T AIR IT.
SO THIS BIG DARN SHARK COMES ALONG....
MY CODE 7.
-YOU WERE COMING HOME LAST NIGHT.
-I'M SORRY.
I HAD SOME BAD CHINESE.
YOU LOOK A LITTLE BANGED UP.
YOU LOOK A LITTLE KNOCKED UP.
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU SURE?
EASY, TIGER!
THERE HE GOES AGAIN.
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN.
YOU OKAY?
I'M BETTER THAN ROGER.
HIS BOAT SANK.
-BOAT SANK?
-I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
NO! NO GREASE!
-HAVE SOME COOKIES.
-WHAT HAPPENED?
GUNFIGHTS, EXPLOSIONS, SHARKS.
THE USUAL.
HERE, BOY.
THANKS.
YOU WERE FISHING.
DOES TROUBLE GO LOOKING FOR YOU?
IT SEEMS TO KNOW PRETTY MUCH
WHERE I AM MOST OF THE TIME.
YOU FINISHED THE NURSERY.
YEAH, I DID.
IT'S GOOD FOR A GIRL OR BOY.
CUTE, HUH?
IT'S A DOGFEST!
DID YOU GET THE WHOLE 1 01 ?
I KNOW. I GOT A LITTLE
CARRIED AWAY WITH PUPPIES.
KID'LL PROBABLY HATE DOGS.
YOU KNOW, LORNA, WE NEVER
EVER TALKED ABOUT MARRIAGE.
I FIGURED YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT.
YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?
WELL, NO.
ME NEITHER.
BREAKFAST?
SERVE AND PROTECT.
SINCE WHEN DO YOU READ THIS SMUT?
IT'S NOT SMUT, IT'S EBONY CLARK.
TRISH GAVE IT TO ME.
"EVERY FIBER IN HIS BEING
DESIRED HER.
HE DEVOURED HER WITH HIS EYES. "
CAN WE TRY THIS THING
ON PAGE 1 96 SOMETIME?
THERE'S A GOOD ONE ON 1 68.
MAYBE LATER.
NOTHING COMES BETWEEN
A PREGNANT LADY AND A MEAL.
HAVE I EVER
"MADE YOUR WOMANHOOD REACH PEAKS...
...TO RIVAL THE HIMALAYAS"?
-FOOTHILLS OF MALIBU, MAYBE.
-NOT EVEN A TETON?
-I DON'T THINK SO.
-THANKS.
I THOUGHT I'D AT LEAST
RATE THE ROCKIES.
YOU KNOW I'M KIDDING.
-YOU SAY THAT TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
-NO, I DON'T.
YOU KNOW I'M PLAYING.
I'VE BEEN TO PLENTY OF
MOUNTAINTOPS WITH YOU.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M HUNGRY.
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KID,
WE'LL BLOW UP MOUNT SAINT HELENS.
-I BROUGHT YOU A DOUGHNUT.
-POLICE FOOD!
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
I DROPPED BY LNTERNAL AFFAIRS YESTERDAY.
HOW'S THE RAT SQUAD?
-I PICKED UP SOMETHING GOOD.
-SOME CHEESE?
I.A. GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP.
THE PERSON SAID ROGER'S ON THE TAKE.
NO, HE'S NOT.
I KNOW! IT'S PROBABLY
SOME JERK HE PUT AWAY.
BUT WITH NEW BOATS
AND PUTTING 2 KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE...
...I THOUGHT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.
I ACTUALLY TRIED TO
PERSUADE HIM TO TAKE MONEY.
STOP IT, RIGGS!
I CAN'T HEAR THAT! NOTHING!
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING ANYMORE.
I'M KIDDING.
-THAT'S AWFUL.
-I'M KIDDING.
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID IT.
WITH HIS PROBLEMS...
...HE'LL BLOW HIS TOP.
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE WHAT?
-IN GENERAL, PROBLEMS.
-YOU MEAN SOMETHING SPECIFIC.
I GOT A NOSE FOR THESE THINGS. WHAT?
YOU'RE PUSHING ME.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO THERE.
GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.
I WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE
TILL YOU TELL ME.
TELL ME.
I'LL TELL YOU!
PREGNANCY DESTROYED MY BRAIN CELLS!
WHAT? WHAT?
I'M DROOLING. WHAT?
PROMISE ME YOU'LL NEVER
SAY A WORD ABOUT THIS EVER.
-I SWEAR, I SWEAR.
-RIGHT HAND!
I SWEAR I WON'T, EVER.
I PROMISE. WHAT?
YOU KNOW HOW ROGER IS
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER DATING COPS.
HE'D KILL THEM. SO?
RIANNE MARRIED ONE, HER BABY'S FATHER.
SHE'S AFRAID TO TELL ROGER.
THEY MET, FELL IN LOVE.
SHE GOT PREGNANT, THEY GOT HITCHED.
NOBODY'S TELLING ROGER?
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN.
IT'S A PACKAGE DEAL?
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT?
-DOES TRISH KNOW?
-SHE KNOWS.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU KNOW.
BUT TRISH KNOWS.
WHO'S THE LUCKY SOON-TO-BE-DEAD
SON-IN-LAW?
-WHO?
-SERGEANT LEE BUTTERS.
THIS JUST GETS BETTER!
NO WONDER HE SUCKS UP TO ROG.
BRINGS HIM APPLES,
BLANKETS, COFFEE....
NOT A WORD.
I'M TELLING YOU, NOTHING!
I WON'T TELL. HE'D SHOOT ME
JUST FOR BEING THE MESSENGER.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. IT'D BE WRONG
TO MESS WITH HIM. I WON'T.
PROMISE.
WE DON'T HAVE TO DISCUSS BOYS' NAMES.
WE'RE HAVING A GIRL.
OKAY. PIADORA.
I LIKE PIADORA. THAT'S SWEET.
I LOVE THAT NAME.
WE'RE TALKING KIDS' NAMES.
HAS RIANNE PICKED ANY OUT?
WE DON'T WANT TO DOUBLE UP.
OSCAR FOR THE BOY,
LOREEN IF IT'S A GIRL.
I LIKE LEE BUTTER.
BETTER! I LIKE IT BETTER.
-DON'T GET ME STARTED.
-I LIKE THOSE NAMES.
CAPTAIN WANTS TO SEE US.
TRISH'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
HAVE FUN SHOPPING FOR THE BABY.
BYE-BYE, HONEY.
WHO HAD THE SLEEPOVER?
JUST AIRING OUT CAMPING GEAR.
-WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
-SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD.
REALLY GOOD!
TRISH HAS FOOD ON THE STOVE.
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
THAT SMELLS LIKE CHINESE FOOD.
CHINESE FOOD?
SHE'S INTO CHINESE COOKING.
I GOT TO TASTE THIS.
-I LOVE CHINESE FOOD.
-HOLD IT! PLEASE!
PLEASE!
THERE'S A CHINESE PERSON IN THE KITCHEN.
I SAW HIM.
A COUPLE OF CHINESE PEOPLE.
ACTUALLY A WHOLE FAMILY.
LARGE FAMILY.
HEY, GUYS!
-IT DOES SMELL GOOD.
-GREAT!
THEY HID IN THE LIFEBOAT.
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.
-SO YOU BROUGHT THEM HOME.
-IT TOOK TWO TRIPS.
-REALLY?
-THEY FIT IN THE STATION WAGON?
THAT'S PING WITH HIS GRANDFATHER, HONG.
HE'S HEAD OF THE FAMILY.
SPEAKS ENGLISH.
HONG, THIS IS MY PARTNER,
MARTIN RIGGS, AND LORNA.
WIFE?
CAN WE SPEAK?
LORNA, THIS IS THE BEST BREAKFAST.
I'M HUNGRY. I'D LOVE SOME.
THIS IS ILLEGAL.
AS IN, "AGAINST THE LAW".
YOU'LL BRING A SHITSTORM
DOWN ON YOU.
JUST HOLD ON!
JUST WAIT A FRIGGING MINUTE!
THE WAY I SEE IT,
THOSE ARE SLAVE SHIPS OUT THERE.
AND I'M FREEING SLAVES...
...IIKE NO ONE DID FOR MY ANCESTORS.
IT'S MY CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING
AND DO IT RIGHT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?
THIS WON'T BE BORING.
NEED ANY HELP?
WHERE IS HE?
WHAT THIS TIME,
FOOD OR MONEY?
-FOOD AND MONEY.
-MONEY.
I SEE YOU MORE
THAN WHEN YOU LIVED HERE.
WE'RE INDEPENDENT NOW.
WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?
-HOOKERS, DRUGS...
-CONTRACEPTIVES.
CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW
THEY TALK TO ME?
IT COSTS MORE TO GO TO SCHOOL NOW.
I GET THE TUITION BILLS.
AND THE GRADES TOO!
THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT
ON A FUTURE ASS-CHEWING.
GET OUT AND GO TO SCHOOL.
I SEE THE TUITION.
I WANT TO SEE SOME GRADES!
I WANT MORE CLUCK FOR MY BUCK.
THANKS FOR THE MONEY.
I'M TIRED.
ME, I CAN'T WIN.
BOY!
DID WE GET A RAISE
AND NOBODY TOLD ME?
I GOT TO GET TO THE BANK.
HOW CAN YOU WHEN YOU'RE TAKEN
TO THE CLEANERS ALL THE TIME?
HEY, GUYS.
HEY, TRISH!
-BOTH THE KIDS LEAVE?
-YES. AND WE'RE BROKE.
IS LORNA HERE?
SHE'S IN THE KITCHEN,
ON HER THIRD BREAKFAST.
I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS.
-I'M SORRY!
-I LOVE IT WHEN YOU DO THAT.
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.
WAIT TILL SHE TRIES RAISING
THAT BABY BY HERSELF.
I'LL BE FINE.
MOVE BACK IN AND GRANDPA'LL
BE UP NIGHTS WITH THE BABY.
BETTER THAN HER
MARRYING THE WRONG GUY.
A COP OR SOMETHING.
TRUE.
COME ON, GUYS.
SEE YOU.
I SHOULD SAY GOODBYE.
HURRY UP!
STUFFING YOUR FACE!
STOP KISSING ME.
TRY THAT.
STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRL.
I'M NOT JOKING.
STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRL.
-JOKING!
-GOT THE BABY BEEPER?
-I KNOW.
-IT'S YOUR FAULT.
IT'S YOUR FAULT.
ALL THE CHICKEN SHIT.
FLAPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY!
IT'S BEEN A YEAR ALMOST.
THIS SHIT AIN'T FUNNY NO MORE!
-ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
-PLEASE! ENOUGH!
I'M THE ONE THAT GETS IT IN THE NECK.
CAN WE EXERCISE MATURITY?
IF I FIND WHO'S DOING THIS,
I'LL KICK HIS ASS.
I CATCH THAT ASSHOLE WHO
PUT MY PICTURE UP, THAT'S IT!
-CUT THEIR BALLS OFF.
-CAPTAIN.
I LOOK OUT EXPECTING
TO SEE ALL THE OLD FACES.
INSTEAD, I SEE KIDS
WHOSE NAMES I BARELY REMEMBER.
WILL YOU SIT DOWN?
WE'RE DINOSAURS HEADED FOR EXTINCTION.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
WE'RE MAKING WAY FOR THE NEW POLICE:
GUYS WITH GUNS AND PSYCHOLOGY DEGREES,
LIKE BUTTERS OUT THERE.
BITER HAS A PSYCHOLOGY DEGREE?
-MORE LIKE A PSYCHO DEGREE.
-TIMES HAVE GOT TO CHANGE.
I ONCE GOT SHOT BY A HOT-RODDER
WITH A ZIP GUN.
THAT'S HOW FAR BACK I GO.
YOU WANTED TO SEE US?
SOME THINGS DON'T CHANGE.
-HERE WE GO.
-THE DEPARTMENT LOST ITS INSURANCE.
ALL THE DAMAGE YOU'VE DONE,
THEY CAN'T GET A NEW ONE...
...WHILE YOU TWO STILL RUN AROUND.
THEY CAN'T FIRE YOU EITHER.
SO, THEY'RE PROMOTING YOU.
-LIEUTENANT!
-THERE'S NO OPEN LIEUTENANT SPOTS.
SO THE CHIEF USED HIS SPECIAL PRIVILEGE,
MAKING YOU CAPTAINS.
-BETTER.
-CAPTAIN!
TIME WAS WHEN THIS WOULD SEND ME OVER
THE FALLS. I'M GETTING OLD.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
CAPTAIN SHIT!
-HANG OUT.
-TAKE LONG LUNCHES.
YELL, "RIGGS, MURTAUGH,
I'M THE CAPTAIN. "
"CHIEF'S SHITTING BRICKS! "
YOU FINISHED?
CAN YOU STAY OUT OF TROUBLE?
ABSOLUTELY.
-CAPTAIN RIGGS!
-CAPTAIN MURTAUGH!
YOU WANT YOUR BADGES?
LET ME SEE THOSE SERGEANT BADGES.
THROW THEM OVER HERE.
THIS IS THE MOST PAINFUL
EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.
-NOW GET OUT!
-THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
ENOUGH WITH THE "CAPTAIN" SHIT!
GET OUT OF HERE!
AFTER YOU, CAPTAIN, I INSIST!
"O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN! "
-CAPTAINS OUTRAGEOUS!
-NEWS TRAVELS FAST.
GET A BREAK FROM REAL POLICE WORK.
PLAY GOLF, TENNIS....
THEY GOT BROWN RINGS
AROUND THEIR NOSES
NOW THAT YOU'RE CAPTAINS,
COME UP IN THE CHOPPER.
-NOT FOR ME.
-I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK.
-IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, CALL US.
-HE'S DOWN-TO-EARTH.
I'M SORRY.
CAN WE KNOCK THIS OFF?
THIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING.
THE MAN'S GOT FEELINGS, YOU KNOW?
CONGRATULATIONS.
LOOK AT YOU!
CAPTAIN MURTAUGH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS,
BUT YOU REALLY INSPIRE ME.
KEEP IT UP.
HOW'S IT GOING, BURTON?
-IT'S BUTTERS, CAPTAIN.
-I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
-KID REALLY LIKES YOU.
-I WISH HE'D CUT IT OUT.
HE LIKES ME?
LIKES ME?
YOU DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME...
...IIKES ME LIKE THAT?
IT'S THE POLICE,
NOT THE MILITARY.
THE MILLENNIUM'S UPON US.
THE CAPTAIN SAID:
"NEW PEOPLE, NEW DEPARTMENT. "
DR. WOODS?
CAPTAIN RIGGS.
-DON'T RUN.
-I'M IN A RUSH.
-I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
-WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?
RECURRING DREAMS ABOUT FLYING DWARFS?
-OR DID YOU COOK UP SOMETHING NEW?
-I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THAT.
I WANT YOUR ADVICE.
I WAS THINKING OF...
-THINKING?
-MARRIAGE.
MARRIAGE?! THE "M" WORD?
DOES "CONFIDENTIALITY" MEAN ANYTHING?
THAT'S FUNNY.
YOU KNOW WHAT'D HAPPEN?
WE'D GO IN MY OFFICE...
...AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'D TELL ME?
YOU'D TELL ME SOMETHING LIKE, "DOC...
...I WANT TO MARRY MURTAUGH. "
OR YOUR MOTHER.
OR NELSON MANDELA!
NELSON MANDELA?!
SOMETHING TO RIDICULE ME, RIGGS.
SOMETHING TO GET A RISE OUT OF ME.
LISTEN CAREFULLY!
I'M...NOT...STUPID!
AND MY TIME IS RESERVED...
...FOR POLICE OFFICERS WITH
REAL NEEDS AND REAL PROBLEMS.
HAVE YOU GOT THAT?!
-HAVE YOU?!
-ASK ME AGAIN?
NO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T LIKE YOU.
STEPHANIE?
I CAN'T GO OUT WITH YOU.
I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP.
I THINK YOU NEED TO SEE SOMEONE.
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU.
NOT IN THIS DEPARTMENT.
BUT STOP BOTHERING ME!
YOU'RE DISGUSTING!
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE?!
WHAT'S SHAKING?
-CAPTAIN RIGGS.
-CAPTAIN MURTAUGH.
TURN AROUND AND DO THAT.
WE'RE CAPTAINS.
HEARD YOU WERE UP TO YOUR ASS
IN CHINESE.
THE TALLER ONES COME UP TO THE NAVEL.
BIG ENOUGH TO KICK YOUR ASS.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
ONE OF THE SHIP'S CREW SHOT AN ILLEGAL,
APPARENTLY UNDER ORDERS...
...AND WE'D DEARLY LIKE TO KNOW
WHO'S SMUGGLING CHINESE.
WE'RE PRETTY SURE THE BIG BOSS
IS BENNY CHAN.
UNCLE BENNY?
YOU KNOW HIM?
-WHEN HE WAS RUNNING SMACK.
-WE NEVER NAILED HIM.
BENNY'S SLIPPERY.
WHERE'S HE HANG OUT?
HE'S GOT A NIGHTCLUB,
SOME RESTAURANTS.
HE OPERATES MAINLY OUT ON NORTH
BROADWAY. HERE'S THE ADDRESS.
HI, FELLAS.
THERE HE IS.
HEY, BURGER! SUMMERS.
BUTTERS.
WHAT YOU GOT ON THE FREIGHTER HOMICIDE?
I TALKED TO SOME ILLEGALS.
THEY ONLY KNEW THE SHOOTER BY SIGHT.
THE BOAT'S REGISTERED UNDER
A DUMMY CORPORATION OUT OF LNDONESIA.
IT'LL BE A ROUGH ONE TO CRACK,
BUT WE'LL NAIL THEM.
YOU EVER HEAR OF BENNY CHAN?
NO. WHAT KIND OF BAD MAN IS HE?
REAL BAD.
CRIME BOSS IN CHINATOWN.
IF IT'S DIRTY AND CHINESE,
BENNY'S DOING IT.
WHERE DO I FIND HIM?
AT THIS RESTAURANT.
I'M HUNGRY FOR CHINESE.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
WE'RE GOING THERE ANYWAY.
WE'LL DRIVE YOU.
LET ME GET MY JACKET.
-NOT WITH HIM.
-HE'S DOING GOOD.
WE MIGHT NEED BACKUP.
SPEND TIME WITH HIM.
YOU MIGHT LEARN TO LOVE HIM.
LIKE A SON.
IN LAW...
...ENFORCEMENT IT PAYS TO KNOW
YOUR FELLOW OFFICER.
SIR, IT'LL BE AN HONOR
TO SHARE EGG ROLLS WITH YOU.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
SHARE?
BUTTERS, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HATE CRIME
IN A SORT OF PERSONAL WAY.
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT, SIR?
LAST NIGHT I NOTICED YOU WERE
MORE THAN SLIGHTLY MIFFED.
WASN'T HE, ROGER?
ANY PARTICULAR REASON?
ABOUT 1 50,000 OF THEM.
THAT'S HOW MANY BULLETS ZINGED
MY NEIGHBORHOOD GROWING UP.
COULDN'T GO OUTSIDE.
COULDN'T GO NEAR A WINDOW.
LIVED AND ATE ON THE FLOOR,
SLEPT AND WATCHED TV ON THE FLOOR.
I DIDN'T LEARN TO WALK
TILL I WAS 1 0.
SPENT MY FORMATIVE YEARS
NOSE-TO-NOSE WITH THE FAMILY BEAGLE.
WHEN I WORK ON A CRIME,
I AIN'T THINKING ABOUT THE CRIME.
I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT FLOOR
AND IT PISSES ME OFF.
-WE SUPPOSED TO MEET LEO SOMEWHERE?
-NO, WHY?
BECAUSE HE'S FOLLOWING US.
DON'T LOOK.
-WHO'S LEO?
-MAYBE IT'S A COINCIDENCE.
-WHAT DOES HE WANT?
-I DON'T KNOW. LET'S FIND OUT.
-FUCKING ASSHOLE!
-BITE ME!
WHATEVER! WHATEVER!
JERK!
YOU LOOKING FOR US?
-YOU SAW ME?
-YEAH, WE SAW YOU.
WHAT YOU DOING, LEO?
I'M PERFECTING MY TAILING TECHNIQUE
NOW THAT I'M A P.I.
HE'S A PRIVATE EYESORE.
INCONSPICUOUS VEHICLE! I LIKE IT.
RIGGS, WHO'S THE PERP?
-WHAT'D YOU BUST HIM FOR?
-I'M A PERP?
A BROTHER IN A POLICE CAR
IS AUTOMATICALLY A PERP?
LOOK AT MY SUIT!
DO I LOOK LIKE THE CRIPS' ACCOUNTANT?
LOOK AT THIS BADGE, BITCH!
CHECK OUT THE GUN.
PUT THE GUN DOWN!
LICENSE! REGISTRATION!
URINE SAMPLE!
I GOT A BADGE TOO!
GERMAN JEWS DIDN'T HAVE IT
EASY AS KIDS!
SO DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.
I KNEW YOU WERE A COP.
I WAS KIDDING.
I CAN SMELL A COP A MILE AWAY.
YOU SAYING I SMELL BAD?
DON'T TURN EVERYTHING AROUND!
YOU'RE SO TOUCHY.
THESE GUYS'LL TELL YOU.
WE GOT A HISTORY TOGETHER.
MAYBE WE'LL WORK TOGETHER SOMEDAY!
I'M THE BOMB!
WE'LL WORK TOGETHER WHEN I OPEN
A CEREAL SHOP, YOU LEPRECHAUN!
I DIDN'T CALL YOU NAMES, FUCKFACE!
DON'T START!
DON'T FOOL AROUND!
-THESE GUYS'LL TELL YOU.
-YOU'RE DOUBLE-PARKED.
OFFICER, I'M JUST TALKING
WITH THE DETECTIVES.
WE DON'T KNOW THIS GUY.
THINK HE WAS DRINKING.
THEY'RE KIDDING.
COME BACK!
I WASN'T DRINKING!
THEY JUST SAID THAT.
BLOW YOUR BREATH IN MY HAND.
I CAN SMELL IT ALREADY.
BLOW IN MY FUCKING EAR!
YOU'RE ALL MINE.
YOU'RE MINE!
YOU PROMISED TO DELIVER THE FAMILY.
THEY'RE NOT AT THE DETENTION CENTER.
THEY MUST HAVE ESCAPED.
THE UNCLE WON'T FINISH UNTIL
HE SEES THEM.
DON'T WORRY, THEY'LL TURN UP.
IN HONG KONG, YOU'D ALREADY BE DEAD.
WHERE'S UNCLE BENNY?
-HE'S NOT HERE.
-IS HE IN THERE?
-I'M SURE HE IS.
-THIS WAY.
YES, IT'S A TWO-WAY.
WE HAVE 3 PEOPLE.
THE RESTAURANT'S OVER THERE.
GO THIS WAY, PLEASE.
THEY SEE US,
BUT WE CAN'T SEE THEM.
-WHERE'S YOUR GREEN CARD?
-THAT'S A RACIST REMARK.
I'M A POLICEMAN
WHO ASKED FOR YOUR GREEN CARD!
THIS IS NOT THE WAY.
YOU'RE THE BOSS
TILL WE GET UP IN HIS ASS.
IT'LL BE FINE.
THEY'VE REFURBISHED!
I COULDN'T STOP THEM.
-OUT, OUT!
-CAN I GET DRINK OR FOOD?
UNCLE BENNY!
I HOPE THIS IS A BAD TIME.
-HE STILL HAS UNCLIPPED EYEBROWS.
-WHAT'D WE TELL YOU?
-WE HATE NOT DISTURBING YOU.
-THIS IS DETECTIVE BUCKLES.
SELL ANY HEROIN? KILL ANYONE LATELY?
HOW'S THE RESTAURANT?
EAT SOMETHING.
GIVE YOU THE POLICE DISCOUNT.
FLIED LICE?
IT IS FRIED RICE, YOU PLICK!
I'M BUSY.
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?
TELL HIM, BUTTKISS.
KNOW ABOUT A BOATLOAD OF
ILLEGALS THAT WENT AGROUND?
JUST WHAT I SAW ON THE NEWS.
SOMEONE LOST BIG MONEY.
AND MISSED MAKING THEM SLAVES.
YOU ARE COPS.
SMUGGLING CHINESE IS AN INS PROBLEM.
WE FOUND 3 BODIES FULL OF HOLES,
SO NOW IT'S A COP PROBLEM.
THREE DEAD CHINESE?
-BILLION MORE WHERE THEY CAME FROM.
-YES, LIFE'S CHEAP.
BUT HE SHOT AT US TOO.
THAT PISSES US OFF.
TOO BAD THEY MISSED.
BUT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT.
WHO'S HE?
HE LOOKS UNHAPPY.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
WHO'S THIS GUY?
IS HE JUST APPRAISING YOUR FURNITURE?
HE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.
THEN HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WORDS LIKE "SCUMBAG"...
... "EAT SHIT"?
I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS GOOD.
-ENTER THE DRAG QUEEN.
-THE INSURANCE, REMEMBER?
IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ON ME,
GET OUT.
WE'RE STILL AROUND.
I'M ON YOUR ASS TOO.
BUT THE DOOR IS THIS WAY!
THIS IS QUICKER.
THIS IS QUICKER, REALLY.
SEE? IT'S QUICKER!
DON'T FORGET MY
YOU IN HONG KONG,
YOU'D BE DEAD.
NO, NOT THAT!
RIGGS! DON'T!
THE INSURANCE....
WHAT THE HELL?
HURRY UP!
TRY IT SOMETIME.
IT'S SATISFYING AND THERAPEUTIC.
-SAVES THE COST OF SHRINKS.
-BAD GUYS CAN'T CALL THE COPS.
-WHY NOT? WE'RE ALREADY HERE!
-EI NI O!
I KNOW THIS GUY.
THAT'S THE CAPTAIN.
HOLD IT!

IT'S AN EXPENSIVE DOG.
-A BOLSHOI.
-BORZOI.
WHATEVER, WHATEVER!
AND YOU FOUND IT?
SORT OF.
LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENS.
INSTEAD OF GOING LOOKING FOR THE DOG,

IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THEIR DOG.
DOG WAS A REAL RAT, THOUGH.
HE SCRATCHED ME.
BUT I GOT THE JOB DONE.

EXCUSE ME.
I HATE THESE PHONES!
YOU GET A CALL, THEY CUT YOU OFF.
YOU MAKE A CALL, THEY CUT YOU OFF!
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING?
THEY FUCK YOU WITH CELL PHONES.
THEY LOVE WHEN YOU GET CUT OFF.
YOU KNOW WHY?
WHEN YOU CALL BACK...
...THEY CHARGE YOU FOR THE FIRST
MINUTE AGAIN AT THAT HIGH RATE.
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO CALL BACK...
...BECAUSE THE 3-HOUR BATTERY

IF YOU'RE BEHIND A HILL, IT GOES....
OR YOU GO THROUGH A TUNNEL.
AND THEY KEEP MAKING IT SMALLER!
YOU KNOW WHY?
SO YOU CAN LOSE IT.

A COFFEE STAIN'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT'D BOTHER ME.
LOOK AT THE WAY YOU DRESS.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
I DON'T HAVE NIFTY SUITS LIKE YOU.

IT'S HOW THEY KNOW WHERE I LIVE.
THERE'S THE SON OF A BITCH RIGHT THERE!
BASTARDS LEFT US TO BURN!

PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO
WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY.
JUST DON'T EXPECT ME TO LIKE IT.
I KNOW THIS MUST BE HARD FOR YOU.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME!
I HOPED WE'D GET TOGETHER
FOR THE HOLIDAYS, SAY CHRISTMAS.
WHY SHOULD WE GET TOGETHER
AND SEE EACH OTHER ON CHRISTMAS?
-I'M TRYING TO REACH OUT.
-REACH SOMEWHERE ELSE!
DO WHAT YOU WANT,
BUT LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.
-I GOT IT.
-I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

WHY YOU GRINNING?

I GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

-PLEASE BE QUIET.
-I'M TRYING! I'M IN PAIN!
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE

WE'RE GOING THROUGH IT AGAIN.
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.
THESE LOOK VERY INTERESTING.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT.
YOU WON'T SHOOT ME.
-YOU'RE LOUSY COPS.
-WE'RE GOOD COPS.
THIS WILL SETTLE HIM DOWN.
BREATHE, UNCLE BENNY.
BREATHE!

TOO LATE FOR WHAT?
WHY'D YOU CALL HIM MY SON-IN-LAW?
UNCLE BENNY? HE'S TOO OLD.
BUY FOUR FATHERS BACK
AT FOUR FATHERS' STORE.
WHY'S HE TALKING ABOUT HIS ANCESTORS?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY YOU CALL HIM MY SON-IN-LAW?
BECAUSE I AM!
I THOUGHT HE WAS....
NO, I'M....
BLOODY MARVELOUS!
YOUR BABY IS HAVING MY BABY.
MY BABY IS HAVING HIS BABY.
AND YOUR BABY? WHOA, BABY!
WHOA, BABY! MY BABY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I COULDN'T STALL ANYMORE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
ROG, LOOK AT THIS.
DOES THAT HURT?
UNCLE BENNY,

THAT'S TWO FOR BENNY.
BLOODY MARVELOUS!
-ARE YOU CRAZY?
-WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
FOR KEEPING IT FROM ME
AND LETTING ME THINK....
HIT HIM, NOT ME.
AS SOON AS WE FIND THE HONGS,
WE'RE GETTING INTO THIS.
UNCLE.
YOU'RE ALL HERE?

WHAT'S GOING ON?
AS PAYMENT FOR BRINGING YOU

...YOUR UNCLE'S WORKING FOR US.
NOW FINISH THE JOB.
WHAT JOB?
NO TIME TO TALK NOW.
TAKE THEM TO THEIR NEW HOMES...
...AND GUARANTEE THEIR SAFETY.
THEN I'LL FINISH.
FINISH NOW OR WATCH THE OTHERS DIE.
RIMMINY ?
A YOUNG BIMBO? A JUMPING JIMINY?
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN 'T REMEMBER.
NO, RIGGS. RENMINBI.
SAY THAT AGAIN.
THAT'S IT!
YOU GOT IT.
MEANS, "PEOPLE'S MONEY. "
PEOPLE'S MONEY?
WHAT ELSE DID BENNY SAY?
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
BUYING BACK HIS ANCESTORS.
AND ABOUT HOW TONIGHT'S...
...TOO LATE.
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
NO, NOTHING AT ALL.
AND THE GUY WHO TORCHED MY HOUSE?
BENNY WAS AFRAID OF HIM.
IF BENNY'S SCARED,
HE'S GOT TO BE A CHINESE TRIAD.
THOSE GUYS KILL ANYONE
IN THEIR WAY.
INCLUDING COPS...
...AND THEIR FAMILIES.
WATCH YOUR ASSES!
-THANKS, NG.
-KEEP ME POSTED.
PICK UP YOUR WIFE, MY DAUGHTER.
-I'LL GET TRISH, YOU GET LORNA.
-HER AND PING.
WHAT?
YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED, DON'T YOU?
NO.
YES. YES, I DO.
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, IT'S OKAY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT
ANY PRESSURE ON YOU.
IF YOU WANT TO SOMEDAY, THAT'D BE GREAT.
IF YOU DON'T...
...I LOVE YOU.
I'LL TAKE YOU ANY WAY I CAN GET YOU.
FEEL THAT!
-PING, FEEL THE BABY!
-HE'S REALLY DANCING.

YOU'RE OKAY.
RIGGS. PICK UP, RIGGS.
RIGGS, IT'S MURTAUGH.
I'M SICK OF THESE FUCKERS.
LET'S JUST FIND THEM AND SHOOT THEM.

WHAT'S GOING ON?
THEY FOUND MY WATCH.
THEY KILLED HONG, HIS UNCLE,
UNCLE BENNY TOO. BODIES ARE IN THERE.
-WHERE'S THE REST OF THE FAMILY?
-THEY'RE OKAY.
INS RAIDED A CHINESE SWEATSHOP.
HONG'S FAMILY WAS BEING HELD THERE
AND THEY LED THEM BACK HERE.
THEY WERE MAKING FUNNY MONEY.
INK'S STILL WET.
-WHERE ARE THE FACES?
-IT'S WHY I CALL IT FUNNY.
WHY ARE THEY MAKING CHINESE MONEY?
CAN THEY EVEN EXCHANGE IT HERE?
-ONLY IN CHINA.
-RENMINBI.
I REMEMBER.
HONG'S UNCLE WAS AN ARTIST.
MAYBE AN ENGRAVER.
BRINGING OVER HIS FAMILY COULD'VE
BEEN HOW HE WAS PAID FOR THE JOB.
-THAT'S THIN.
-IT'S NOT.
KEEP TALKING. WHAT?
BENNY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT PAYING...
...BUYING BACK HIS FOREFATHERS.
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
BENNY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT BUYING
BACK HIS FOREFATHERS.
YOU SAID ANCESTORS.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
THE NUMBER FOUR.
FOUR FATHERS.
THEY WERE THE TOP GUYS
OF THE HONG KONG TRIAD.
THEY DISAPPEARED FROM PRISON.
REDS JAILED THEM WHEN THEY
TOOK OVER HONG KONG.
I BET THEY'RE HERE.
DAMN, WE'RE GOOD.
GRAB PING. I DON'T WANT HIM
TO SEE THE BODIES.
...AND WHERE THE FOUR FATHERS ARE.

-WHERE'RE WE GOING?
-L.A. HARBOR.
-WHAT'S THERE?
IT'S A FOREIGN TRADE ZONE.
SHADY DEALS WITH THE CHINESE MILITARY.
IT'S RUN BY A CORRUPT CHINESE GENERAL.
I GOT IT, A CORRUPT CHINESE GENERAL
BROUGHT THE FOUR FATHERS HERE...
...AND THE TRIAD'S
BUYING THEIR RELEASE.
THAT'S WHAT UNCLE BENNY MEANT
BY BUYING THEM BACK.
THAT GENERAL WILL SHIT

LET'S TELL HIM.
HI, GANG.

SON OF A BITCH WILL BE A HANDFUL.
SINCE I MET YOU, I'VE DONE SOME
HAIRY SHIT. BUT THIS WON'T HAPPEN.
I'M GOING TO BE A GRANDFATHER...
...AND YOU AND LORNA WILL HAVE A BABY.
HE AIN'T WORTH DYING FOR, RIGGS.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF HE GETS AWAY WE CAN
TRACK HIM DOWN LATER...
...WITH A HOWITZER OR SOMETHING.
YOUR SON-IN-LAW'S BLEEDING.
WE SHOULD GET HIM AND GO.
-SHIT, IT'S RAINING.
-I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT.
GUY'S TOO DAMN GOOD.
HOW'D HE DO THAT THING WITH THE GUN?
HE TOOK MY GUN APART WITH ONE MOVE.
HOW'D HE DO THAT?
HOW?
YEAH, OKAY.
LET'S GO ASK HIM.

I WAS KNOCKED DOWN OVER HERE!
I COULDN'T EVEN GET UP!
COME BACK HERE!
LET'S GO HOME, MAN.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE ENOUGH
LATELY, VICKY. I'M SORRY.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT LORNA.
ME AND LORNA.
IT'S LIKE THIS.
SHE WANTS TO GET MARRIED...
...AND I LOVE HER.
I WON'T LIE TO YOU. I DO.
AND I WANT TO MAKE HER HAPPY.
I'M LOOKING FOR HELP HERE, HONEY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
FUNNY TALKING TO YOU ABOUT
THIS STUFF...
YOU WANT TO GET YOURSELF SHOT?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS TAILING YOU.
SORRY.
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.
I GUESS YOU WANT TO BE ALONE.
I'D APPRECIATE IT.
WHEN I WAS A KID I HAD A PET FROG.
WHAT?
GIVE ME A SECOND.
LET ME TELL YOU THIS.
I HAD THIS PET FROG, NAME WAS FROGGY.
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD.
I DIDN'T HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS.
IN FACT...
...I HAD NO FRIENDS.
I USED TO KISS THE FROG TOO.
I THOUGHT MAYBE...
...IT WOULD TURN INTO A PRINCESS
SINCE I WAS A BOY.
AND IT COULD BE...
...MY MOTHER.
THEY TOLD ME THAT
SHE LEFT OR SOMETHING.
AND MY FATHER WAS NO BARGAIN.
AND SO, JUST THE FROG...
...FROGGY, WAS MY FRIEND.
I LOVED HIM AND TOOK HIM
EVERYWHERE WITH ME.
I WAS RIDING MY BIKE ONE DAY...
...HE JUMPED OUT OF THE BOX...
...AND I RAN HIM OVER
WITH THE BACK TIRE.
I KILLED HIM.
I WAS REALLY HEARTBROKEN. REALLY.
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND,
THE ONLY THING I EVER LOVED.
AND THEN I MET YOU...
...AND ROGER.
YOU LOOKED AFTER ME
A LOT MORE THAN YOU HAD TO.
I'M TERRIBLE TO YOU, LEO.
NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE MY FAMILY...
...AND MY FRIENDS.
YOU'RE NOT BETTER FRIENDS THAN FROGGY,
JUST DIFFERENT.
I JUST THOUGHT THAT
MIGHT BE RELEVANT.
OKAY, I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE NOW.
I GOT A FUNNY F...
WHAT'S WRONG?!
I'M HAVING A BABY.
LORNA BEEPED ME.
YES, IT'S LORNA.
SHE'S HAVING THE BABY.

-I'LL BE BEHIND YOU.
YOU PICKED A STRANGE ANGEL, HONEY.
BUT I GOT THE MESSAGE.
I GOT THE MESSAGE.
I'LL ALWAYS HAVE THIS.
ALWAYS HAVE YOU.
IN HERE AND HERE.
THANKS, HONEY.

YOU'RE AS READY AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE.
FINE! JUST WHEEL ME IN.

MA'AM, LET GO!
I AM A POLICE OFFICER!
AND I AM NOT READY!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
-ARE YOU THE HUSBAND?
-YES.
HONEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
NO, I'M NOT.
I SAID I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED, BUT I DO.
I WANT TO BE A WIFE
BEFORE I'M A MOTHER.
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO.
-YOU SAID "OKAY"?
-YES, I DID. OKAY.
LET'S DO IT.
HE SAID OKAY.
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-HE SAID OKAY, LEO.
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

I WANT TO HEAR IT
BEFORE THE BABY COMES!

OF A TRANSITION PHASE!
HONEY, EVERYBODY, CALM DOWN.
CALM DOWN. OKAY?
